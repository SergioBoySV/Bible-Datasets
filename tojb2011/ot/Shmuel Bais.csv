Shmuel Bais,1,1,"Now it came to pass after the mot Sha'ul, when Dovid was returned from the slaughter of Amalek, and Dovid had abode two yamim in Tziklag;"
Shmuel Bais,1,2,"It came even to pass on Yom HaShlishi, that, hinei, an ish came out of the machaneh from Sha'ul with his clothes torn, and adamah upon his rosh; and so it was, when he came to Dovid, that he fell to the ground, and prostrated himself."
Shmuel Bais,1,3,"And Dovid said unto him, From where comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the machaneh Yisroel am I escaped."
Shmuel Bais,1,4,"And Dovid said unto him, How went the matter? Tell me now. And he answered, That the people are fled from the milchamah, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Sha'ul and Yonatan bno are dead also."
Shmuel Bais,1,5,"And Dovid said unto the na'ar that told him, How knowest thou that Sha'ul and Yonatan bno are dead?"
Shmuel Bais,1,6,"And the na'ar that told him said, As I happened to be upon Mt Gilboa, hinei, Sha'ul leaned upon his khanit; and, hinei, the chariots and ba'alei haparashim followed hard after him."
Shmuel Bais,1,7,"And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Hineini."
Shmuel Bais,1,8,"And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amaleki."
Shmuel Bais,1,9,"He said unto me again, Stand, now, over me, and slay me; for shavatz (death through agony) is come upon me, because my nefesh is yet still in me."
Shmuel Bais,1,10,"So I stood over him, and slaughtered him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen; and I took the nezer (crown, diadem) that was upon his rosh, and the etzadah (bracelet, band) that was on his zero'a, and have brought them here unto adoni."
Shmuel Bais,1,11,"Then Dovid took hold on his clothes, and made the kri'ah on them; and likewise all the anashim that were with him;"
Shmuel Bais,1,12,"And they mourned, and wept, and did a tzom until the erev, for Sha'ul, and for Yonatan bno, and for the Am Hashem , and for Bais Yisroel; because they were fallen by the cherev."
Shmuel Bais,1,13,"And Dovid said unto the na'ar that told him, From where art thou? And he answered, I am ben ish ger, an Amaleki."
Shmuel Bais,1,14,"And Dovid said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine yad to destroy Hashem ʼs moshiach?"
Shmuel Bais,1,15,"And Dovid called one of the ne'arim, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he struck him so that he died."
Shmuel Bais,1,16,"And Dovid said unto him, Thy dahm be upon thy rosh; for thine own peh hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain Hashem ʼs moshiach."
Shmuel Bais,1,17,And Dovid lamented with this kinah (lamentation) over Sha'ul and over Yonatan bno;
Shmuel Bais,1,18,"Also he bade them teach the Bnei Yehudah: The Keshet. Hinei, it is written in the Sefer HaYasher:"
Shmuel Bais,1,19,The glory of Yisroel is slain upon thy high places; how are the Gibborim fallen!
Shmuel Bais,1,20,"Tell it not in Gat, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon; lest the banot Pelishtim rejoice, lest the banot ha'arelim triumph."
Shmuel Bais,1,21,"Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no tal, neither let there be matar, upon you, nor fields of terumot; for there the mogen Gibborim is defiled, the mogen of Sha'ul, as though he had not been mashiach (anointed) with shemen."
Shmuel Bais,1,22,"From the dahm of the slain, from the chelev of the Gibborim, the keshet Yonatan turned not back, and the cherev Sha'ul returned not empty."
Shmuel Bais,1,23,"Sha'ul and Yonatan were beloved and gracious in their lives, and in their mot they were not parted; they were swifter than nesharim, they were stronger than arayot."
Shmuel Bais,1,24,"Ye banot Yisroel, weep over Sha'ul, who clothed you in scarlet, with fineries, who put on ornaments of zahav upon your apparel."
Shmuel Bais,1,25,"How are the Gibborim fallen in the midst of the milchamah! O Yonatan, thou wast slain on thine heights."
Shmuel Bais,1,26,"I am distressed for thee, my brother Yonatan; very pleasant hast thou been unto me; thy ahavah was wonderful to me, passing ahavat nashim."
Shmuel Bais,1,27,"How are the Gibborim fallen, and the k'lei milchamah (weapons of war) perished!"
Shmuel Bais,2,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Dovid inquired of Hashem , saying, Shall I go up into any of the towns of Yehudah? And Hashem said unto him, Go up. And Dovid said, To where shall I go up? And he said, Unto Chevron."
Shmuel Bais,2,2,"So Dovid went up there, and his two nashim also, Achino'am the Yizre'elit, and Avigal eshet Naval the Karmeli."
Shmuel Bais,2,3,"And his anashim that were with him did Dovid bring up, every ish with his household; and they dwelt in the towns of Chevron."
Shmuel Bais,2,4,"And anshei Yehudah came, and there they anointed Dovid Melech over Bais Yehudah. And they told Dovid, saying, The Anshei Yavesh-Gil'ad were they that buried Sha'ul."
Shmuel Bais,2,5,"And Dovid sent malachim unto the Anshei Yavesh-Gil'ad, and said unto them, Berukhim atem of Hashem , that ye have showed this chesed unto adoneichem, even unto Sha'ul, burying him."
Shmuel Bais,2,6,"And now Hashem show chesed and emes unto you; and I also will repay you this tovah, because ye have done this thing."
Shmuel Bais,2,7,"Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, be ye bnei chayil; for adoneichem Sha'ul is dead, and also the Bais Yehudah have anointed me Melech over them."
Shmuel Bais,2,8,"But Avner ben Ner, Sar Tzava of Sha'ul, took Ish-Boshet Ben Sha'ul, and brought him over to Machanayim;"
Shmuel Bais,2,9,"And made him melech over Gil'ad, and over the Ashuri, and over Yizre'el, and over Ephrayim, and over Binyamin, and over all Yisroel."
Shmuel Bais,2,10,"Ish-Boshet ben Sha'ul was forty shanah when he began to reign over Yisroel, and reigned two shanim. But Bais Yehudah followed Dovid."
Shmuel Bais,2,11,And the time that Dovid was Melech in Chevron over Bais Yehudah was shivah shanah and shishah chodashim.
Shmuel Bais,2,12,"And Avner ben Ner, and the avadim of Ish-Boshet Ben Sha'ul, went out from Machanayim to Giv'on."
Shmuel Bais,2,13,"And Yoav Ben Tzeruyah, and the avadim of Dovid, went out, and met together by the pool of Giv'on; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool."
Shmuel Bais,2,14,"And Avner said to Yoav, Let the young men now arise for a contest before us. And Yoav said, Let them arise."
Shmuel Bais,2,15,"Then there arose and went over by mispar twelve of Binyamin, which pertained to Ish-Boshet ben Sha'ul, and twelve of the avadim of Dovid."
Shmuel Bais,2,16,"And they caught every one his re'a by the rosh, and thrust his cherev in his re'aʼs side; so they fell down together; therefore that makom was called Chelkat-Hatzurim, which is in Giv'on."
Shmuel Bais,2,17,"And there was a very fierce milchamah that day; and Avner was defeated, and the Anshei Yisroel, before the Avadim of Dovid."
Shmuel Bais,2,18,"And there were three Bnei Tzeruyah there: Yoav, Avishai, Asahel; Asahel was as swift of foot as a gazelle."
Shmuel Bais,2,19,Asahel pursued after Avner; and in going he turned not to the right nor to the left from following Avner.
Shmuel Bais,2,20,"Then Avner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am."
Shmuel Bais,2,21,"And Avner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the ne'arim, and capture thee his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him."
Shmuel Bais,2,22,"And Avner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me; why should I strike thee to the ground? How then should I hold up my face to Yoav achicha?"
Shmuel Bais,2,23,"Howbeit he refused to turn aside; therefore Avner with the butt end of the khanit struck him under the fifth rib, that the khanit came out his back; and he fell down there, and died in the same place; and it came to pass, that as many as came to the makom where Asahel fell down and died, stopped."
Shmuel Bais,2,24,"Yoav also and Avishai pursued after Avner; and the shemesh went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giach by the derech midbar Giv'on."
Shmuel Bais,2,25,"And the Bnei Binyamin gathered themselves together after Avner, and became aguddah echat (one unit) , and stood on the top of one hill."
Shmuel Bais,2,26,"Then Avner called to Yoav, and said, Shall the cherev devour lanetzach (forever) ? Knowest thou not that it will be marah in the latter end? Ad mosai shall it be then, until thou bid the people return from pursuing their brethren?"
Shmuel Bais,2,27,"And Yoav said, As HaElohim liveth, if thou hadst not spoken, HaAm would have continued every one following his brother, not stopping until haboker."
Shmuel Bais,2,28,"So Yoav blew a shofar, and kol haAm stood still, and pursued after Yisroel no more, neither fought they any more."
Shmuel Bais,2,29,"And Avner and his anashim marched kol halailah through the Aravah, and passed over Yarden, and went through all Bitron, and they came to Machanayim."
Shmuel Bais,2,30,"And Yoav returned from following Avner; and when he had gathered kol HaAm together, there lacked of Dovidʼs avadim nineteen ish and Asahel."
Shmuel Bais,2,31,"But the avadim of Dovid had struck down of Binyamin, and of anshei Avner, so that three hundred and threescore ish died."
Shmuel Bais,2,32,"And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the kever of aviv, which was in Beit-Lechem. And Yoav and his men marched kol halailah, and they came to Chevron at dawn."
Shmuel Bais,3,1,"Now there was long milchamah between the Bais Sha'ul and the Bais Dovid; but Dovid grew stronger and stronger, and the Bais Sha'ul grew weaker and weaker."
Shmuel Bais,3,2,"And unto Dovid were banim born in Chevron; and his bechor was Amnon, of Achino'am the Yizre'elit;"
Shmuel Bais,3,3,"And his second, Kile'av, of Avigal eshet Naval the Karmeli; and the third, Avshalom ben Ma'akhah bat Talmai Melech Geshur;"
Shmuel Bais,3,4,"And the fourth, Adoniyah Ben Chaggit; and the fifth, Shephatyah Ben Avital;"
Shmuel Bais,3,5,"And the sixth, Yitre'am, by Eglah eshet Dovid. These were born to Dovid in Chevron."
Shmuel Bais,3,6,"And it came to pass, while there was milchamah between the Bais Sha'ul and the Bais Dovid, that Avner was strengthening his grip on the Bais Sha'ul."
Shmuel Bais,3,7,"And Sha'ul had a pilegesh (concubine) , whose shem was Ritzpah Bat Ayah; and he said to Avner, why hast thou gone in unto pilegesh avi?"
Shmuel Bais,3,8,"Then was Avner very angry at the devarim of Ish-Boshet, and said, Am I Yehudahʼs rosh kelev? Today do I show chesed unto the Bais Sha'ul avicha, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the yad Dovid, and then thou chargest me today with an avon concerning this isha?"
Shmuel Bais,3,9,"So do Elohim to Avner, and more also! As Hashem hath sworn to Dovid, even so I do for him;"
Shmuel Bais,3,10,"To transfer the Mamlachah from the Bais Sha'ul, and to set up the Kisse Dovid over Yisroel and over Yehudah, from Dan even to Be'er-Sheva."
Shmuel Bais,3,11,"And he could not answer Avner a davar again, because he feared him."
Shmuel Bais,3,12,"And Avner sent malachim to Dovid on his behalf, saying, Whose is the eretz? Saying also, Cut thy brit with me, and, hinei, my yad shall be with thee, to bring about kol Yisroel unto thee."
Shmuel Bais,3,13,"And he said, Tov; I will make a brit with thee; but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Bat Sha'ul, when thou comest to see my face."
Shmuel Bais,3,14,"And Dovid sent malachim to Ish-Boshet Ben Sha'ul, saying, Deliver ishti Michal, which I took in erusin to me for a hundred arlot (foreskins) of the Pelishtim (Philistines)."
Shmuel Bais,3,15,"And Ish-Boshet sent, and took her from her ish, even from Palti'el Ben Layish."
Shmuel Bais,3,16,"And her ish went with her going along, weeping behind her to Bachurim. Then said Avner unto him, Go, return. And he returned."
Shmuel Bais,3,17,"And Avner had communication with the Ziknei Yisroel, saying, Ye sought for Dovid in times past to be melech over you;"
Shmuel Bais,3,18,"Now then do it; for Hashem hath spoken of Dovid, saying, By the yad of Avdi Dovid I will save My people Yisroel out of the yad Pelishtim, and out of the yad of all their oyevim."
Shmuel Bais,3,19,"And Avner also spoke in the oznayim of Binyamin; and Avner went also to speak in the oznayim of Dovid in Chevron all that seemed tov to Yisroel, and to the kol Bais Binyamin."
Shmuel Bais,3,20,"So Avner came to Dovid to Chevron, and esrim anashim with him. And Dovid made Avner and the anashim that were with him a mishteh."
Shmuel Bais,3,21,"And Avner said unto Dovid, I will arise and go, and will gather kol Yisroel unto adoni HaMelech, that they may cut a Brit with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine lev desireth. And Dovid sent Avner away; and he went in shalom."
Shmuel Bais,3,22,"And, hinei, the avadim of Dovid and Yoav came from a raid, bringing in shalal rav (great plunder) with them; but Avner was not with Dovid in Chevron; he had sent him away, he was gone in shalom."
Shmuel Bais,3,23,"When Yoav and all the tzava that was with him were come, they told Yoav, saying, Avner Ben Ner came to HaMelech, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in shalom."
Shmuel Bais,3,24,"Then Yoav came to HaMelech, and said, What hast thou done? Hinei, Avner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?"
Shmuel Bais,3,25,"Thou knowest Avner Ben Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to have da'as of thy going out and thy coming in, and to have da'as of all that thou doest."
Shmuel Bais,3,26,"And when Yoav was come out from Dovid, he sent malachim after Avner, which brought him back from the well of Sirah; but Dovid knew it not."
Shmuel Bais,3,27,"And when Avner was returned to Chevron, Yoav took him aside in the sha'ar to speak with him privately, and struck him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the dahm of Asahel his brother."
Shmuel Bais,3,28,"And afterward when Dovid heard it, he said, I and my mamlachah are naki (innocent) before Hashem ad olam from the dahm of Avner Ben Ner;"
Shmuel Bais,3,29,"Let it rest on the rosh Yoav, and on kol Bais Aviv; and let there never fail from the Bais Yoav one that hath a discharge, or that is a metzora (leper) , or that leaneth on a pelech (stick, crutch) , or that falleth on the cherev, or that lacketh lechem."
Shmuel Bais,3,30,"So Yoav, and Avishai his brother slaughtered Avner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Giv'on in the milchamah."
Shmuel Bais,3,31,"And Dovid said to Yoav, and to kol HaAm that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Avner. And Dovid HaMelech himself followed the mittah (bier, frame or bed holding corpse)."
Shmuel Bais,3,32,And they buried Avner in Chevron; and HaMelech lifted up his voice and wept at the kever of Avner; and kol HaAm wept.
Shmuel Bais,3,33,"And in a dirge HaMelech lamented over Avner, and said, Died Avner as a naval (fool) dieth?"
Shmuel Bais,3,34,"Thy hands were not bound, nor thy raglayim put into fetters; as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And kol HaAm wept again over him."
Shmuel Bais,3,35,"And when kol HaAm came to cause Dovid to eat lechem while it was yet day, Dovid swore a shevua (oath) , saying, So do Elohim to me, and more also, if I taste lechem, or anything else, till the shemesh go down."
Shmuel Bais,3,36,"And kol HaAm took notice of it, and it pleased them; whatsoever HaMelech did pleased kol HaAm."
Shmuel Bais,3,37,For kol HaAm and kol Yisroel had da'as that day that it was not of HaMelech to murder Avner Ben Ner.
Shmuel Bais,3,38,"And HaMelech said unto his avadim, Know ye not that there is sar and gadol fallen this day in Yisroel?"
Shmuel Bais,3,39,"And I am this day weak, though moshuach melech (being anointed king) ; and these anashim the Bnei Tzeruyah are too harsh for me; Hashem shall reward the doer of evil according to his ra'ah (evil)."
Shmuel Bais,4,1,"And when Ben Sha'ul heard that Avner was dead in Chevron, his hands fell limp; kol Yisroel became alarmed."
Shmuel Bais,4,2,"And Ben Sha'ul had two anashim that were sarei gedudim (captains of raiding parties) ; the shem of the one was Ba'anah, and the shem of the other Rechav; these were the Bnei Rimmon HaBe'eroti, of the Bnei Binyamin: (for [the town of] Be'erot was reckoned as part of Binyamin.)"
Shmuel Bais,4,3,"And the Be'eroti fled to Gittayim, and were sojourners there until this day."
Shmuel Bais,4,4,"And Yonatan Ben Sha'ul had a ben that was nekheh raglayim (lame in both feet) . He was five years old when the news came of Sha'ul and Yonatan from Yizre'el (Jezreel) , and his nurse took him up, and fled; and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame, and shmo Mephivoshet."
Shmuel Bais,4,5,"And the Bnei Rimmon HaBe'eroti, Rechav and Ba'anah, went, and came about chom hayom (the heat of the day) to the bais Ish-Boshet, who lay on a bed at tzahorayim (noon)."
Shmuel Bais,4,6,"And they came into the midst of the bais, as though they would have been getting chittim; and they stabbed him under the fifth rib; and Rechav and Ba'anah achiv (his brother) escaped."
Shmuel Bais,4,7,"For when they had gone into the bais, he lay on his mittah (bed) in his chedar mishkav (bedroom) , and they stabbed him, and killed him, and beheaded him, and took his rosh, and got away through the derech HaAravah kol halailah."
Shmuel Bais,4,8,"And they brought the rosh Ish-Boshet unto Dovid at Chevron, and said to HaMelech, Hinei the rosh Ish-Boshet Ben Sha'ul thine oyev (enemy) , which sought thy nefesh; and Hashem hath given nekamot (vengeance) against Sha'ul unto adoni HaMelech this day, and of his zera."
Shmuel Bais,4,9,"And Dovid answered Rechav and Ba'anah achiv, the Bnei Rimmon HaBe'eroti, and said unto them, As Hashem liveth, who hath padah (ransomed, redeemed) my nefesh out of kol tzarah,"
Shmuel Bais,4,10,"When one told me, saying, Hinei, Sha'ul is dead, thinking he was like mevaser (one who brings glad tidings, good news, evangelist) , I took hold of him, and slaughtered him in Tziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his besorah (good news);"
Shmuel Bais,4,11,"How much more, when anashim resha'im have slain an ish tzaddik in his own bais upon his mishkav (bed) ? Shall I not therefore now require his dahm of your yad, and take you away from HaAretz?"
Shmuel Bais,4,12,"And Dovid commanded his ne'arim (young men) , and they slaughtered them, and cut off their yadayim and their raglayim, and hung them up over the berekhah (pool) in Chevron. But they took the rosh Ish-Boshet, and buried it in the kever of Avner in Chevron."
Shmuel Bais,5,1,"Then came kol Shivtei Yisroel to Dovid unto Chevron, and spoke, saying, Hineni, we are thy etzem and thy basar."
Shmuel Bais,5,2,"Also in time past, when Sha'ul was melech over us, thou wast he that didst lead out and brought in Yisroel; and Hashem said to thee, Thou shalt feed My people Yisroel, and thou shalt become Nagid over Yisroel."
Shmuel Bais,5,3,So all the zekenim of Yisroel came to HaMelech at Chevron; and Dovid HaMelech cut a Brit with them in Chevron before Hashem ; v'yimshechu (and they anointed) Dovid Melech Yisroel.
Shmuel Bais,5,4,"Dovid was in age shloshim shanah when he began to reign, and he reigned arba'im shanim."
Shmuel Bais,5,5,In Chevron he reigned over Yehudah sheva shanim and shishah chodashim; and in Yerushalayim he reigned shloshim v'shalosh shanah over kol Yisroel and Yehudah.
Shmuel Bais,5,6,"And HaMelech and his anashim went to Yerushalayim unto the Yevusi, the inhabitants of the land; which spoke unto Dovid, saying, Thou shalt not come in here; but the ivrim (blind ones) and the pisechim (lame ones) shall repel thee; thinking, Dovid cannot come in here."
Shmuel Bais,5,7,Nevertheless Dovid captured the Metzudat Tziyon (Fortress of Zion) ; the same is Ir Dovid (City of Dovid).
Shmuel Bais,5,8,"And Dovid said on that day, Anyone that striketh the Yevusi will have to reach the water shaft, the pisechim and the ivrim whom the nefesh Dovid hates; thus the saying… The ivver and the piseach are here, he will not enter the bais."
Shmuel Bais,5,9,"So Dovid dwelt in the Metzudah, and called it Ir Dovid. And Dovid built [Ir Dovid] all around from Millo and inward."
Shmuel Bais,5,10,"And Dovid went on, and grew gadol, and Hashem Elohei Tzva'os was with him."
Shmuel Bais,5,11,"And Chiram Melech Tzor sent malachim to Dovid, and cedar trees, and charashim of etz (carpenters) and charashim of even (stone masons) kir (wall, i.e., masons of wall stones) ; and they built Dovid a Bais (Palace)."
Shmuel Bais,5,12,"And Dovid had da'as that Hashem had established him Melech Yisroel, and that he had exalted his mamlachah for the sake of His people Yisroel."
Shmuel Bais,5,13,And Dovid took him more pilagshim and nashim out of Yerushalayim after he was come from Chevron; and there were more banim and banot born to Dovid.
Shmuel Bais,5,14,"And these are the shmot of those that were born unto him in Yerushalayim: Shammua, and Shovav, and Natan, and Sh'lomo,"
Shmuel Bais,5,15,"Yivchar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Yaphia,"
Shmuel Bais,5,16,"And Elishama, and Elyada, and Eliphelet."
Shmuel Bais,5,17,"But when the Pelishtim heard that they had mashechu (anointed) Dovid Melech over Yisroel, all the Pelishtim came up to seek Dovid; but Dovid heard of it, and went down to the metzudah (stronghold)."
Shmuel Bais,5,18,The Pelishtim also came and spread themselves in the Emek Repha'im.
Shmuel Bais,5,19,"And Dovid inquired of Hashem , saying, Shall I go up against the Pelishtim? Wilt Thou deliver them into mine yad? And Hashem said unto Dovid, Go up; for I will doubtless deliver the Pelishtim into thine yad."
Shmuel Bais,5,20,"So Dovid came to Ba'al-Peratzim, and Dovid struck them there, and said, Hashem hath paratz (broken out) upon mine enemies before me, as of peretz mayim. Therefore he called the shem of that place Ba'al-Peratzim."
Shmuel Bais,5,21,"And there they left their atzabim, and Dovid and his anashim burned them."
Shmuel Bais,5,22,"And the Pelishtim came up yet again, and spread themselves out in the Emek Repha'im."
Shmuel Bais,5,23,"And when Dovid inquired of Hashem , He said, Thou shalt not go up; but circle around behind them, and come upon them opposite the mulberry trees."
Shmuel Bais,5,24,"And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then shall Hashem go out before thee, to strike the machaneh of the Pelishtim."
Shmuel Bais,5,25,"And Dovid did so, as Hashem had commanded him; and struck the Pelishtim from Geva until thou come to Gezer."
Shmuel Bais,6,1,"Again, Dovid gathered together kol bachur b'Yisroel, shloshim elef."
Shmuel Bais,6,2,"And Dovid arose, and went with kol HaAm that were with him from Ba'ale-Yehudah, to bring up from there the Aron HaElohim which is called by the Shem; the Shem Hashem Tzva'os that is enthroned on the keruvim is upon it."
Shmuel Bais,6,3,"And they set the Aron HaElohim upon an agalah chadashah (new wagon, cart) , and brought it out of the bais of Avinadav that was in Giv'ah; and Uzza and Achyo, the Bnei Avinadav, guided the agalah chadashah."
Shmuel Bais,6,4,"And they brought it out of the bais Avinadav which was at Giv'ah, with the Aron HaElohim; and Achyo walked before the Aron."
Shmuel Bais,6,5,"And Dovid and all Bais Yisroel rejoiced before Hashem on all manner of instruments made of cypress, even on kinnorot, on nevalim (lyres) , on tambourines, on castanets, and on cymbals."
Shmuel Bais,6,6,"And when they came to goren Nakhon, Uzza reached forth to the Aron HaElohim, and took hold of it; for the ox tilted it."
Shmuel Bais,6,7,And the Af Hashem was kindled against Uzzah; and HaElohim struck him down there for the shal (error) ; and there he died by the Aron HaElohim.
Shmuel Bais,6,8,"And Dovid burned with anger, because Hashem had made a peretz (outburst) , breaking out upon Uzzah; and he called the shem of the makom (place) Peretz-Uzzah, which is what it is called to this day."
Shmuel Bais,6,9,"And Dovid was afraid of Hashem that day, and said, How can the Aron Hashem come to me?"
Shmuel Bais,6,10,So Dovid would not move the Aron Hashem unto him in Ir Dovid; but Dovid carried it aside into the bais Oved-Edom the Gitti.
Shmuel Bais,6,11,"And the Aron Hashem remained in the bais Oved-Edom the Gitti three months; and Hashem blessed Oved-Edom, and all his bais."
Shmuel Bais,6,12,"And it was told Dovid HaMelech, saying, Hashem hath blessed the bais Oved-Edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the Aron HaElohim. So Dovid went and brought up the Aron HaElohim from the bais Oved-Edom into Ir Dovid with simchah."
Shmuel Bais,6,13,"And it was so, that when they that nosei Aron Hashem (carried the Aron HaShem) had gone six steps, he sacrificed ox and fattened calf."
Shmuel Bais,6,14,And Dovid danced before Hashem with kol oz; and Dovid was girded with an ephod bad (linen ephod).
Shmuel Bais,6,15,So Dovid and kol Bais Yisroel brought up the Aron Hashem with ter'uah (shout) and with the sound of the shofar.
Shmuel Bais,6,16,"And as the Aron Hashem came into Ir Dovid, Michal Bat Sha'ul looked through a chalon (window) , and saw Dovid HaMelech leaping and dancing before Hashem ; and she despised him in her lev."
Shmuel Bais,6,17,"And they brought in the Aron Hashem , and set it in its makom, inside the ohel that Dovid had pitched for it; and Dovid offered olot (burnt offerings) and shelamim (peace offerings) before Hashem."
Shmuel Bais,6,18,"And as soon as Dovid had made an end of offering the olah (burnt offering) and the shelamim (peace offering) , he made brocha on HaAm b'Shem Hashem Tzva'os."
Shmuel Bais,6,19,"And he apportioned among kol HaAm, even among kol hamon Yisroel, to isha as well as ish, to every one challat, lechem, a portion of meat, and a raisin cake. So kol HaAm departed, each to his bais."
Shmuel Bais,6,20,"Then Dovid returned to make brocha on his bais. And Michal Bat Sha'ul came out to meet Dovid, and said, How distinquished was the Melech Yisroel today, who disrobed today in the eyes of the amehot (handmaids) of his avadim, as one of the rekim (vain, empty fellows, indecent boors) shamelessly uncovereth himself!"
Shmuel Bais,6,21,"And Dovid said unto Michal, It was before Hashem , which chose me rather than thy av, and rather than all his bais, to appoint me Nagid over Am Hashem , over Yisroel: therefore will I rejoice before Hashem."
Shmuel Bais,6,22,"And I will yet be more undignified than this, and will be shafal (lowly) in mine own eyes; and of the amahot (maidservants) which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be held in honor."
Shmuel Bais,6,23,Therefore Michal Bat Sha'ul had no yeled unto her yom mot.
Shmuel Bais,7,1,"And it came to pass, when HaMelech sat in his Bais, and Hashem had given him rest round about from all his oyevim;"
Shmuel Bais,7,2,"That HaMelech said unto Natan HaNavi, See now, I dwell in a Bais of cedar, but the Aron HaElohim dwelleth within the curtain."
Shmuel Bais,7,3,"And Natan said to HaMelech, Go, do all that is in thine lev; for Hashem is with thee."
Shmuel Bais,7,4,"And it came to pass that lailah, that the Devar Hashem came unto Natan, saying,"
Shmuel Bais,7,5,"Go and tell Avdi Dovid, Thus saith Hashem , Shalt thou build Me a Bais for Me to dwell in?"
Shmuel Bais,7,6,"Whereas I have not dwelt in any Bais since the time that I brought up the Bnei Yisroel out of Mitzrayim, even to this day, but have walked in an Ohel and in a Mishkan."
Shmuel Bais,7,7,"In all the places wherein I have walked with kol Bnei Yisroel spoke I a word with any of the Shivtei Yisroel, whom I commanded, to shepherd My people Yisroel, saying, Why build ye not Me a Bais of cedar?"
Shmuel Bais,7,8,"Now therefore so shalt thou say unto Avdi Dovid, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, I took thee from the sheepfold, from following the tzon, to be Nagid over My people, over Yisroel:"
Shmuel Bais,7,9,"And I was with thee whithersoever thou didst go, and have cut off all thine oyevim out of thy sight, and have made thee a shem gadol, like unto the shem of the Gedolim that are on ha'aretz."
Shmuel Bais,7,10,"Moreover I will appoint makom (place, home) for My people Yisroel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and be disturbed no more; neither shall the bnei avlah (children of wickedness) afflict them any more, as in former times,"
Shmuel Bais,7,11,"Even since the time that I commanded Shofetim to be over My people Yisroel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine oyevim. Also Hashem declareth to thee that He will make thee a Bais."
Shmuel Bais,7,12,"And when thy yamim be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy Avot, I will raise up thy Zera after thee, which shall proceed out of thy loins, and I will establish his Mamlachah (Kingdom)."
Shmuel Bais,7,13,"He shall build a Bais for My Shem, and I will establish the kisse (throne) of his Mamlachah ad olam."
Shmuel Bais,7,14,"I will be his Av, and he shall be My Ben. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the shevet anashim, and with the floggings of bnei adam;"
Shmuel Bais,7,15,"But My chesed shall not be taken away from him, as I took it from Sha'ul, whom I removed from before thee."
Shmuel Bais,7,16,And thine Bais and thy Mamlachah shall be established ad olam before thee; thy kisse (throne) shall be established ad olam (forever).
Shmuel Bais,7,17,"According to all these devarim, and according to all this chizzayon (revelation) , so did Natan speak unto Dovid."
Shmuel Bais,7,18,"Then went HaMelech Dovid in, and sat before Hashem , and he said, Who am I, Adonoi Hashem ? And what is my Bais, that Thou hast brought me this far?"
Shmuel Bais,7,19,"And as if this were a small thing in Thy sight, Adonoi Hashem , Thou hast spoken also the future of Bais Avdecha. And is this fitting for haAdam, Adonoi Hashem?"
Shmuel Bais,7,20,"And what can Dovid say more unto Thee? For Thou, Adonoi Hashem , knowest Avdecha."
Shmuel Bais,7,21,"For the sake of Thy word, and according to Thine own lev, hast Thou done all this gedullah (great thing) , and made it known to Avdecha."
Shmuel Bais,7,22,"Wherefore Thou art great, Adonoi Hashem ; for there is none like Thee, neither is there any Elohim but Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears."
Shmuel Bais,7,23,"And what Goy echad in ha'aretz is like Thy people, even like Yisroel, whom Elohim went to redeem for an Am for Himself, and to make Him a Shem, and to do for Thee hagedullah (the great thing) and nora'ot, for Thy land, before Thy people, which Thou redeemedst to Thee, from Mitzrayim, from the Goyim and their g-ds?"
Shmuel Bais,7,24,"For Thou hast confirmed to Thyself Thy people Yisroel to be an Am unto Thee ad olam; and Thou, Hashem , art become their Elohim."
Shmuel Bais,7,25,"And now, Hashem Elohim, the davar (word, promise) that Thou hast spoken concerning Avdecha, and concerning his Bais, establish it ad olam, and do just as Thou hast said."
Shmuel Bais,7,26,"And let Thy Shem be magnified ad olam, saying, Hashem Tzivos is Elohim over Yisroel; and let the Bais of Avdecha Dovid be established before Thee."
Shmuel Bais,7,27,"For Thou, Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel, hast revealed to ozen Avdecha, saying, I will build thee a Bais; therefore hath Avdecha found in his lev to pray this tefillah unto Thee."
Shmuel Bais,7,28,"And now, Adonoi Hashem Atah hu HaElohim, and Thy devarim are emes, and Thou hast promised hatovah hazot unto Avdecha;"
Shmuel Bais,7,29,"Therefore now let it please Thee to bless the Bais Avdecha, that it may continue l'olam before Thee; for Thou, Adonoi Hashem , hast spoken it; and with Thy brocha let the Bais Avdecha be blessed l'olam."
Shmuel Bais,8,1,"And after this it came to pass that Dovid struck the Pelishtim, and subdued them; and Dovid took Meteg Ammah out of the yad (hand, control) of the Pelishtim."
Shmuel Bais,8,2,"And he struck Moav, and measured them with a chevel (cord, rope) , casting them down to the ground; even with two chavalim (ropes, cords) measured he to put to death, and with one full chevel (cord) to keep alive. And so Moav became to Dovid as avadim, and brought minchah (gifts, tribute)."
Shmuel Bais,8,3,"Dovid struck also Hadadezer Ben Rechov Melech Tzovah, as he went to recover his yad (rule) at the nahar (river) Euphrates."
Shmuel Bais,8,4,"And Dovid captured from him an elef and seven hundred parashim, and twenty elef foot soldiers; and Dovid hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one hundred chariots."
Shmuel Bais,8,5,"And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer Melech Tzovah, Dovid struck down the Syrians two and twenty elef ish."
Shmuel Bais,8,6,"Then Dovid put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became avadim to Dovid, and brought minchah. And Hashem saved Dovid wherever he went."
Shmuel Bais,8,7,"And Dovid took the shields of zahav that were on the avadim of Hadadezer, and brought them to Yerushalayim."
Shmuel Bais,8,8,"And from Betach, and from Berotai, cities of Hadadezer, Dovid HaMelech took exceeding much nechoshet."
Shmuel Bais,8,9,"When To'i Melech Chamat heard that Dovid had defeated all the army of Hadadezer,"
Shmuel Bais,8,10,"Then To'i sent Yoram bno unto Dovid HaMelech, to give him shalom greetings, and to put a berachah on him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and defeated him; for Hadadezer had been at war with To'u. And Yoram brought with him vessels of kesef, and vessels of zahav, and vessels of nechoshet;"
Shmuel Bais,8,11,"Which also Dovid HaMelech did dedicate as kodesh unto Hashem , with the kesef and zahav that he had dedicated as kodesh of kol HaGoyim which he subdued;"
Shmuel Bais,8,12,"Of Syria, and of Moav, and of the Bnei Ammon, and of the Pelishtim, and of Amalek, and of the plunder of Hadadezer Ben Rechov Melech Tzovah."
Shmuel Bais,8,13,"And Dovid made himself a shem when he returned from striking down Aram in the Gey Melach, being eighteen elef men."
Shmuel Bais,8,14,"And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became avadim to Dovid. And Hashem saved Dovid wherever he went."
Shmuel Bais,8,15,And Dovid reigned over kol Yisroel; and Dovid executed mishpat and tzedakah unto all his people.
Shmuel Bais,8,16,"And Yoav Ben Tzeruyah was over the army; and Yehoshaphat Ben Achilud was mazkir (secretary, recorder)."
Shmuel Bais,8,17,"And Tzadok Ben Achituv, and Achimelech Ben Evyatar (Abiathar) , were the kohanim; and Serayah was the sofer (scribe);"
Shmuel Bais,8,18,And Benayah Ben Yehoyada was over both the Kereti and the Peleti; and Benei Dovid were kohanim.
Shmuel Bais,9,1,"And Dovid said, Is there yet any that is left of the Bais Sha'ul, that I may show him chesed for the sake of Yonatan?"
Shmuel Bais,9,2,"And there was of the Bais Sha'ul an eved and shmo was Tziva. And when they had called him unto Dovid, HaMelech said unto him, Art thou Tziva? And he replied, Thy eved."
Shmuel Bais,9,3,"And HaMelech said, Is there not yet any of the Bais Sha'ul, that I may show the chesed Elohim unto him? And Tziva said unto HaMelech, Yonatan hath yet a ben, which is nakheh (crippled, lame) raglayim (both feet)."
Shmuel Bais,9,4,"And HaMelech said unto him, Eifoh hu (where is he) ? And Tziva said unto HaMelech, Hinei, he is in the Bais Machir Ben Ammi'el, in Lo-Devar."
Shmuel Bais,9,5,"Then HaMelech Dovid sent, and had him brought out of the Bais Machir Ben Ammi'el, from Lo-Devar."
Shmuel Bais,9,6,"Now when Mephivoshet Ben Yonatan Ben Sha'ul, was come unto Dovid, he fell on his face, and prostated himself. And Dovid said, Mephivoshet. And he answered, Hinei, thy eved!"
Shmuel Bais,9,7,"And Dovid said unto him, Fear not; for I will surely show thee chesed for sake of Yonatan Avicha, and will restore thee kol sadeh Sha'ul Avicha; and thou shalt eat lechem at my shulchan tamid."
Shmuel Bais,9,8,"And he prostated himself, and said, What is thy eved, that thou shouldest look upon such a kelev hamet (dead dog) as I am?"
Shmuel Bais,9,9,"Then HaMelech called to Tziva na'ar Sha'ul, and said unto him, I have given unto thy adonʼs ben all that pertained to Sha'ul and to all his Bais."
Shmuel Bais,9,10,"Thou therefore, and thy banim, and thy avadim, shall till the adamah for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy adonʼs ben may have lechem to eat; but Mephivoshet the ben adoneicha shall eat lechem tamid at my shulchan. Now Tziva had fifteen banim and twenty avadim."
Shmuel Bais,9,11,"Then said Tziva unto HaMelech, According to all that adoni HaMelech hath commanded his eved, so shall thy eved do. As for Mephivoshet, said HaMelech, he shall eat at my shulchan, as one of the Bnei HaMelech."
Shmuel Bais,9,12,"And Mephivoshet had a ben katan, shmo Micha. And kol moshav Bais Tziva were avadim unto Mephivoshet."
Shmuel Bais,9,13,So Mephivoshet dwelt in Yerushalayim; for he did eat continually at the shulchan HaMelech; and was pisei'ach (crippled) in both his raglayim.
Shmuel Bais,10,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Melech Bnei Ammon died, and Chanun bno reigned in his place."
Shmuel Bais,10,2,"Then said Dovid, I will show chesed unto Chanun Ben Nachash, as aviv (his father) showed chesed unto me. And Dovid sent to console him by the yad of his avadim for aviv. And avadim of Dovid came into Eretz Bnei Ammon."
Shmuel Bais,10,3,"And the sarim (princes) of the Bnei Ammon said unto Chanun their adon, Thinkest thou that Dovid doth honor avicha, that he hath sent menachamim (comforters) unto thee? Hath not Dovid rather sent his avadim unto thee, to explore the Ir, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?"
Shmuel Bais,10,4,"Therefore, Chanun took the avadim of Dovid, and shaved off half of their zekanim (beards) , and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away."
Shmuel Bais,10,5,"When they told it unto Dovid, he sent to meet them, because the anashim were greatly humiliated; and HaMelech said, Tarry at Yericho until your zekanim be grown, and then return."
Shmuel Bais,10,6,"And when the Bnei Ammon saw that they became stench before Dovid, the Bnei Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beit-Rechov and the Syrians of Tzova, twenty elef foot soldiers, and of Melech Ma'akhah an elef ish, and of Ish-Tov, twelve elef ish."
Shmuel Bais,10,7,"And when Dovid heard of it, he sent Yoav, and all the tzava (host, army) of the Gibborim."
Shmuel Bais,10,8,"And the Bnei Ammon came out, arrayed for milchamah at the petach hasha'ar (city gate) ; and the Syrians of Tzova, and of Rechov, and Ish-Tov, and Ma'akhah, were by themselves in the sadeh."
Shmuel Bais,10,9,"When Yoav saw that the front of the milchamah (battle) was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Yisroel, and put them in array against the Syrians;"
Shmuel Bais,10,10,"And the rest of the people he delivered under the yad (command) of Avishai achiv (his brother) , that he might put them in array against the Bnei Ammon."
Shmuel Bais,10,11,"And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt be for me for yeshu'ah (salvation, rescue) ; but if the Bnei Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come for you for yeshu'ah (salvation, rescue)."
Shmuel Bais,10,12,"Chazak (be strong) ! And let us play the man for amenu (our people) , and for the towns of Eloheinu; and Hashem do that which seemeth Him hatov in His einayim."
Shmuel Bais,10,13,"And Yoav drew near, and HaAm that were with him, unto the milchamah against the Syrians; and they fled before him."
Shmuel Bais,10,14,"And when the Bnei Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Avishai, and entered into the Ir. So Yoav returned from the Bnei Ammon, and came to Yerushalayim."
Shmuel Bais,10,15,"And when the Syrians saw that they were defeated before Yisroel, they gathered themselves together."
Shmuel Bais,10,16,"And Hadadezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the Nahar; and they came to Chelam; and Shovakh the Sar Tzeva (commander of the army) of Hadadezer went before them."
Shmuel Bais,10,17,"And when it was told Dovid, he gathered kol Yisroel together, and crossed over Yarden, and came to Chelam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against Dovid, and fought against him."
Shmuel Bais,10,18,"And the Syrians fled before Yisroel; and Dovid slaughtered the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty elef parashim, and struck down Shovakh the Sar of his Tzeva (army) , who died there."
Shmuel Bais,10,19,"And when all the melachim that were avadim (vassals) to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Yisroel, they made shalom with Yisroel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the Bnei Ammon any more."
Shmuel Bais,11,1,"And it came to pass, at the teshuvah (turning) of the shanah (year) , at the time when melachim go forth [to war], that Dovid sent Yoav, and his avadim with him, and kol Yisroel; and they destroyed the Bnei Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But Dovid tarried still at Yerushalayim."
Shmuel Bais,11,2,"And it came to pass at haerev, that Dovid arose from off his mishkav (bed) , and walked upon the gag of the Bais HaMelech; and from the gag (roof) he saw an isha bathing; and the isha was very good to look upon."
Shmuel Bais,11,3,"And Dovid sent and inquired after the isha. And one said, Is not this Bat-Sheva Bat Eli'am, eshet Uriyah the Chitti?"
Shmuel Bais,11,4,"And Dovid sent malachim, and he got her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she had been purifying herself from her tumah (uncleanness) ; and she returned unto her bais."
Shmuel Bais,11,5,"And the isha conceived, and sent and told Dovid, and said, Harah anochi (I am with child, I am pregnant)."
Shmuel Bais,11,6,"And Dovid sent to Yoav, saying, Send me Uriyah the Chitti. And Yoav sent Uriyah to Dovid."
Shmuel Bais,11,7,"And when Uriyah was come unto him, Dovid asked of him regarding the shalom Yoav, and the shalom HaAm, and the shalom hamilchamah."
Shmuel Bais,11,8,"And Dovid said to Uriyah, Go down to thy bais, and wash thy feet. And Uriyah departed out of the Bais HaMelech and there followed after him a masat HaMelech (a present, gift, of the king, i.e. a royal feast)."
Shmuel Bais,11,9,"But Uriyah slept at the petach Beis HaMelech (entrance of the Kingʼs Palace) with all the avadim of his adon, and went not down to his bais."
Shmuel Bais,11,10,"And when they had told Dovid, saying, Uriyah went not down unto his bais, Dovid said unto Uriyah, Camest thou not from thy derech (journey) ? Why then didst thou not go down unto thine bais?"
Shmuel Bais,11,11,"And Uriyah said unto Dovid, The Aron, and Yisroel, and Yehudah, abide in sukkot; and adoni Yoav, and the avadim of adoni are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into mine bais, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my isha? As thou livest, and as thy nefesh liveth, I will not do this thing."
Shmuel Bais,11,12,"And Dovid said to Uriyah, Tarry here today also, and makhar (tomorrow) I will send thee back. So Uriyah abode in Yerushalayim that day, and the next."
Shmuel Bais,11,13,"And when Dovid had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him shikker; and at erev he went out to lie on his mishkav with the avadim of his adon, but went not down to his bais."
Shmuel Bais,11,14,"And it came to pass in the boker, that Dovid wrote a sefer to Yoav, and sent it by the yad of Uriyah."
Shmuel Bais,11,15,"And he wrote in the sefer, saying, Set ye Uriyah on the frontlines of the milchamah hachazakah (strongest battle) , and withdraw from in back of him, that he may be struck down, and die."
Shmuel Bais,11,16,"And it came to pass, when Yoav was shomer with a siege on the Ir, he assigned Uriyah unto the makom where he knew that anshei chayil (valiant men) were."
Shmuel Bais,11,17,"And the Anshei HaIr came out, and fought with Yoav; and there fell some of HaAm of the Avdei Dovid; and Uriyah the Chitti died also."
Shmuel Bais,11,18,Then Yoav sent and told Dovid all the things concerning the milchamah;
Shmuel Bais,11,19,"And charged the malach, saying, When thou hast made an end of reporting all the matters of the milchamah unto HaMelech,"
Shmuel Bais,11,20,"And if so be that the chamat HaMelech (wrath of the King) flare up, and he say unto thee, why approached ye so near unto the Ir when ye did fight? Knew ye not that they would shoot from the chomah (wall)?"
Shmuel Bais,11,21,"Who struck Avimelech Ben Yerubeshet? Did not an isha throw down on him a millstone from the chomah, that he died in Tevetz? Why went ye near the chomah? Then say thou, Thy eved Uriyah the Chitti is dead also."
Shmuel Bais,11,22,"So the malach went, and came and told Dovid all that Yoav had sent him for."
Shmuel Bais,11,23,"And the malach said unto Dovid, Surely the anashim prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the sadeh, and we were upon them even unto the petach hasha'ar."
Shmuel Bais,11,24,"And the archers shot from off the chomah upon thy avadim; and some of the avadim of HaMelech are dead, and thy eved Uriyah the Chitti is dead also."
Shmuel Bais,11,25,"Then Dovid said unto the malach, Thus shalt thou say unto Yoav, Let not this thing be evil in thy sight, for the cherev devoureth one as well as another; make thy milchamah more chazak (strong) against the Ir, and overthrow it; and give him a chazak encouragement."
Shmuel Bais,11,26,"And when the eshet Uriyah heard that Uriyah her ish was dead, she mourned for her ba'al (husband)."
Shmuel Bais,11,27,"And when the evel (mourning) was past, Dovid sent and brought her to his bais, and she became his isha, and bore him ben. But the thing that Dovid had done was evil in the sight of Hashem."
Shmuel Bais,12,1,"And Hashem sent Natan unto Dovid. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two anashim in one town; the one an oisher, and the other poor."
Shmuel Bais,12,2,The oisher had exceeding many tzon and bakar;
Shmuel Bais,12,3,"But the poor man had nothing, except one kivsah ketanah (little ewe lamb), which he had acquired and nourished; and she grew up together with him, and with his banim; it did eat of his own bread, and drank of his own kos (cup) , and slept in his kheyk (bosom) , and was unto him as a bat."
Shmuel Bais,12,4,"And there came a helech (traveler) unto the oisher, and he refused to take of his own tzon and of his own bakar, to prepare for the ore'ach (wayfaring man, traveller, guest) that was come unto him; but took the poor manʼs kivsah (ewe lamb) , and prepared her for the ish that was come to him."
Shmuel Bais,12,5,"And af Dovid (Dovidʼs anger) was greatly kindled against the ish; and he said to Natan, As Hashem liveth, the ish that hath done this thing is ben mavet (a son of death, worthy of death);"
Shmuel Bais,12,6,"And he shall restore the kivsah fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no khamal (pity)."
Shmuel Bais,12,7,"And Natan said to Dovid, Atah haIsh (thou art the Man) . Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel: Meshachticha (I anointed thee) Melech over Yisroel, and I delivered thee out of the yad Sha'ul;"
Shmuel Bais,12,8,"And I gave thee the bais adoneicha, and the nashim of adoneicha into thy kheyk (bosom) , and gave thee Bais Yisroel and Yehudah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such as this and such as that."
Shmuel Bais,12,9,"Why hast thou despised the Davar Hashem , to do the rah in His eyes? Thou hast killed Uriyah the Chitti with the cherev, and hast taken his isha to be thy isha, and hast slain him with the cherev of the Bnei Ammon."
Shmuel Bais,12,10,"Now therefore the cherev shall not depart from thine Bais ad olam; because thou hast despised Me, hast taken the isha Uriyah the Chitti as thy isha."
Shmuel Bais,12,11,"Thus saith Hashem , Hineni, I will raise up ra'ah (adversity) against thee out of thine own Bais, and I will take thy nashim before thine eyes, and give them unto thy re'a, and he shall lie with thy nashim in the sight of this shemesh."
Shmuel Bais,12,12,"For thou didst it baseter (secretly) ; but I will do this thing before kol Yisroel, and before the shemesh."
Shmuel Bais,12,13,"And Dovid said unto Natan, I have sinned against Hashem . And Natan said unto Dovid, Hashem also hath put away thy chattat; thou shalt not die."
Shmuel Bais,12,14,"Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the oyevim of Hashem to ni'etz (deride, ridicule, revile, blaspheme) , also haben (the son) that is born unto thee shall surely die."
Shmuel Bais,12,15,"And Natan departed unto his bais. And Hashem struck the yeled that Uriyahʼs isha bore unto Dovid, and it was very ill."
Shmuel Bais,12,16,"Dovid therefore pleaded with HaElohim for the na'ar; and Dovid did a tzom, and went in, and lay all night upon ha'aretz."
Shmuel Bais,12,17,"And the zekenim of his Bais arose, and went to him, to raise him up from ha'aretz; but he would not, neither did he eat lechem with them."
Shmuel Bais,12,18,"And it came to pass on the yom hashevi'i, that the yeled died. And the avadim of Dovid feared to tell him that the yeled was dead; for they said, Hinei, while the yeled was yet chai (alive) , we spoke unto him, and he would not pay heed unto koleinu (our voice) ; so if we tell him that the yeled is dead, will he then do something horrendous?"
Shmuel Bais,12,19,"But when Dovid saw that his avadim were mitlachashim (whisperers) , Dovid perceived that the yeled was dead; therefore Dovid said unto his avadim, Is the yeled dead? And they said, Met (dead, he is dead)."
Shmuel Bais,12,20,"Then Dovid arose from ha'aretz, and bathed, and put on lotion, and changed his apparel, and came into the Bais Hashem , and worshiped; then he came to his own Bais; and when he requested, they set lechem before him, and he did eat."
Shmuel Bais,12,21,"Then said his avadim unto him, What davar is this that thou hast done? Thou didst undergo a tzom and weep for the sake of the yeled, while it was alive; but when the yeled was dead, thou didst rise and eat lechem."
Shmuel Bais,12,22,"And he said, While the yeled was yet chai, I underwent a tzom and wept; for I said, Who can tell whether Hashem will be gracious to me, that the yeled may live?"
Shmuel Bais,12,23,"But now he is met (dead) , why should I undergo a tzom? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me."
Shmuel Bais,12,24,"And Dovid comforted Bat-Sheva his isha, and went in unto her, and lay with her; and she bore ben, and he called shmo Sh'lomo; and Hashem loved him."
Shmuel Bais,12,25,"And He sent by the yad Natan HaNavi; and he called shmo Yedidyah (Beloved of Hashem) , for the sake of Hashem."
Shmuel Bais,12,26,"And Yoav fought against Rabbah of the Bnei Ammon, and captured ir hameluchah (the royal city)."
Shmuel Bais,12,27,"And Yoav sent malachim to Dovid, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the Ir HaMayim."
Shmuel Bais,12,28,"Now therefore gather the rest of HaAm (the army) together, and encamp against the Ir, and capture it; lest I take the Ir, and it be called after my shem."
Shmuel Bais,12,29,"And Dovid gathered kol haAm together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and captured it."
Shmuel Bais,12,30,"And he took their melechʼs ateret from off his rosh, the weight whereof was a talent of zahav with the precious stones; and it was set on Dovidʼs rosh. And he brought forth the plunder of the ir (city) in great abundance."
Shmuel Bais,12,31,"And he brought forth ha'am that were therein, and put them under saws, and under threshing tools of barzel, and under axes of barzel, and made them go through the brickkilns; and thus did he unto all the towns of the Bnei Ammon. So Dovid and kol haAm returned unto Yerushalayim."
Shmuel Bais,13,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Avshalom Ben Dovid had an achot yafeh (beautiful sister) , whose shem was Tamar; and Amnon Ben Dovid loved her."
Shmuel Bais,13,2,"And Amnon was so distressed, that he fell ill for his achot Tamar; for she was betulah; but Amnon thought it impossible for him to do anything to her."
Shmuel Bais,13,3,"But Amnon had a re'a, shmo Yonadav Ben Shime'ah Achi Dovid; and Yonadav was an ish chacham (shrewd man)."
Shmuel Bais,13,4,"And he said unto him, Why art thou, being Ben HaMelech, becoming dal (weak, wretched) from day to day? Wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, Ani ohev (I love) Tamar achot Avshalom achi."
Shmuel Bais,13,5,"And Yehonadav said unto him, Lay thee down on thy mishkav, and make thyself sick; and when avicha cometh to see thee, say unto him, now, let my achot Tamar come, and cause me to eat lechem, and prepare the briyah (food) in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her yad."
Shmuel Bais,13,6,"So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick; and when HaMelech was come to see him, Amnon said unto HaMelech, Now, let Tamar my achot come, and make me a couple of [heart-shaped] cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her yad."
Shmuel Bais,13,7,"Then Dovid sent to Tamar to the palace, saying, Go now to the bais of thy brother Amnon, and prepare for him briyah (food)."
Shmuel Bais,13,8,"So Tamar went to the bais of her brother Amnon; and he was lying down. And she took batzek (dough) , and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the [heart-shaped] cakes."
Shmuel Bais,13,9,"And she took a masret (pan) , and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have kol ish go out from me. And they went out kol ish from him."
Shmuel Bais,13,10,"And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the briyah into the cheder ([bed] room), that I may eat from thine yad. And Tamar took the [heart-shaped] cakes which she had prepared, and brought them into the bedroom to Amnon her brother."
Shmuel Bais,13,11,"And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my achot."
Shmuel Bais,13,12,"And she answered him, No, achi, do not violate me; for no such thing ought to be done in Yisroel; do not thou this nevalah (foul deed, shameful thing)."
Shmuel Bais,13,13,"And I, to where shall I cause my cherpah (shame, disgrace) to go? And as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the nevalim (wicked fools) in Yisroel. Now therefore, speak unto HaMelech; for he will not withhold me from thee."
Shmuel Bais,13,14,"Howbeit he would not pay heed unto her voice; but, being stronger than she, violated her and raped her, and lay with her."
Shmuel Bais,13,15,"Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the sinah (hatred) wherewith he hated her was gedolah me'od than the ahavah wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Get up, get out."
Shmuel Bais,13,16,"And she said unto him, No, do not this ra'ah in sending me away which is gedolah than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not pay heed unto her."
Shmuel Bais,13,17,"Then he called his na'ar that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this outside from me, and bolt the delet after her."
Shmuel Bais,13,18,"She had a kesones of various colors upon her; for with such were the banot HaMelech that were betulot apparelled. Then his mesharet (servant) brought her outside, and bolted the delet after her."
Shmuel Bais,13,19,"And Tamar put efer (ash) on her rosh (head) and made the kri'ah (tearing, rending) on her kesones of various colors that was on her, and laid her yad on her rosh, and went on weeping as she went."
Shmuel Bais,13,20,"And Avshalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? But hold now thy peace, my achot; he is thy brother; this thing take not to heart. So Tamar remained shomemah (desolate) in the bais of her brother Avshalom."
Shmuel Bais,13,21,"But when Dovid HaMelech heard of all these things, he was very angry."
Shmuel Bais,13,22,"And Avshalom spoke unto his brother Amnon not a davar neither rah nor tov; for Avshalom hated Amnon, because he had violated and raped his achot Tamar."
Shmuel Bais,13,23,"And it came to pass after two full shanim, that Avshalom had gozezim (sheepshearers) in Ba'al-Chatzor, which is in Ephrayim; and Avshalom invited all the Bnei HaMelech."
Shmuel Bais,13,24,"And Avshalom came to HaMelech, and said, Hinei now, thy eved hath gozezim; let HaMelech, now, and his avadim go with thy eved."
Shmuel Bais,13,25,"And HaMelech said to Avshalom, No, beni (my son) , let us not all now go, lest we be a burden unto thee. And he urged him; howbeit he would not go, but put a bracha on him."
Shmuel Bais,13,26,"Then said Avshalom, If not, now, let achi Amnon go with us. And HaMelech said unto him, Why should he go with thee?"
Shmuel Bais,13,27,"But Avshalom urged him, that he let Amnon and kol Bnei HaMelech go with him."
Shmuel Bais,13,28,"Now Avshalom had commanded his avadim, saying, Mark ye now when Amnonʼs lev is high with yayin, and when I say unto you, Strike Amnon; then kill him, fear not; have not I commanded you? Be chazak (courageous) , and be bnei chayil."
Shmuel Bais,13,29,"And the na'arei Avshalom did unto Amnon as Avshalom had commanded. Then all the Bnei HaMelech arose, and every man mounted him up upon his pered (mule) , and fled."
Shmuel Bais,13,30,"And it came to pass, while they were baderech (on the way) , that report came to Dovid, saying, Avshalom hath slain all the Bnei HaMelech, and there is not one of them left."
Shmuel Bais,13,31,"Then HaMelech arose, and made the kri'ah on his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his avadim stood by with their clothes torn."
Shmuel Bais,13,32,"And Yonadav Ben Shime'ah achi Dovid, answered and said, Let not adoni suppose that they have slain all the young men, the Bnei HaMelech; for Amnon only is dead; for by the command of Avshalom this hath been determined from the day that he violated and raped Tamar his achot."
Shmuel Bais,13,33,"Now therefore let not adoni HaMelech take the thing to his lev, to think that all the Bnei HaMelech are dead; for Amnon only is dead."
Shmuel Bais,13,34,"But Avshalom fled. And the na'ar tzofeh (watchman) lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, hinei, there came am rav (much people) by the derech of the hillside behind him."
Shmuel Bais,13,35,"And Yonadav said unto HaMelech, Hinei, the Bnei HaMelech come; as the davar avdecha (word of thy servant) , so it is."
Shmuel Bais,13,36,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, hinei, the Bnei HaMelech came, and lifted up their voice and wailed; and HaMelech also and all his avadim wept gadol me'od."
Shmuel Bais,13,37,"But Avshalom fled, and went to Talmai Ben Ammihud Melech Geshur. And Dovid mourned for bno kol hayamim."
Shmuel Bais,13,38,"So Avshalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there shalosh shanim."
Shmuel Bais,13,39,And the nefesh of Dovid HaMelech longed to go forth unto Avshalom; for he was consoled concerning Amnon that died.
Shmuel Bais,14,1,Now Yoav Ben Tzeruyah perceived that the lev HaMelech was toward Avshalom.
Shmuel Bais,14,2,"And Yoav sent to Tekoa, and brought from there an isha chachamah, and said unto her, now, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with shemen, but be as an isha that had a long time mourned for the dead;"
Shmuel Bais,14,3,"And come to HaMelech, and speak on this manner unto him. So Yoav put the devarim in her peh (mouth)."
Shmuel Bais,14,4,"And when the isha of Tekoa spoke to HaMelech, she fell on her face to the ground, and prostrated herself, and said, Hoshi'ah (help) , O Melech."
Shmuel Bais,14,5,"And HaMelech said unto her, What troubleth thee? She answered, I am indeed an almanah, and mine ish is dead."
Shmuel Bais,14,6,"And thy shifchah had two banim, and they two fought together in the sadeh, and there was none to separate them, but the one struck the other, and killed him."
Shmuel Bais,14,7,"And, hinei, kol hamishpakhah is risen against thine shifchah (handmaid) , and they said, Deliver him that struck his brother, that we may kill him, for the nefesh of his brother whom he killed; and we will destroy the yoresh (heir) also; and so they shall quench my burning coal remaining, and shall not leave to my ish shem nor she'erit upon ha'adamah."
Shmuel Bais,14,8,"And HaMelech said to the isha, Go to thine bais; I will give charge concerning thee."
Shmuel Bais,14,9,"And the isha of Tekoa said unto HaMelech, Adoni, O Melech, the avon (guilt) be on me, and on my bais avi; and HaMelech and his kisse be guiltless."
Shmuel Bais,14,10,"And HaMelech said, Whoever saith anything unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more."
Shmuel Bais,14,11,"Then said she, Now, let HaMelech remember Hashem Eloheicha, that thou wouldest not suffer the Go'el HaDahm to destroy any more, lest they destroy beni (my son) . And he said, As Hashem liveth, there shall not one hair of thy ben fall to the ground."
Shmuel Bais,14,12,"Then the isha said, Let thine shifchah, now, speak one word unto adoni Ha-Melech. And he said, Say on."
Shmuel Bais,14,13,"And the isha said, why then hast thou thought such a thing against the Am Elohim? For HaMelech doth speak this thing as one which is guilty, in that HaMelech doth not bring back home again his banished."
Shmuel Bais,14,14,"For we must needs die, are as mayim spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; yet Elohim doth not take away nefesh; but devises means, so that His banished be not expelled from Him."
Shmuel Bais,14,15,"Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto adoni HaMelech, it is because the people have made me afraid; and thy shifchah thought, I will now speak unto HaMelech; it may be that HaMelech will perform the request of his amah (servant)."
Shmuel Bais,14,16,"For HaMelech will hear, to deliver his amah (servant) out of the palm of the ish that would destroy me and beni (my son) together out of the nachalat Elohim."
Shmuel Bais,14,17,"Then thine shifchah said, The devar adoni HaMelech shall now be as menuchah (rest, comfort) ; for as a malach HaElohim, so is adoni HaMelech to discern the tov and the rah; therefore Hashem Eloheicha will be with thee."
Shmuel Bais,14,18,"Then HaMelech answered and said unto the isha, Hide not from me, now, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the isha said, Let adoni HaMelech now speak."
Shmuel Bais,14,19,"And HaMelech said, Is not the yad Yoav with thee in all this? And the isha answered and said, As thy nefesh liveth, adoni HaMelech, none can turn to the right or to the left from anything that adoni HaMelech hath spoken; for thy eved Yoav, he instructed me, and he put all these devarim in the peh (mouth) of thine shifchah (handmaid);"
Shmuel Bais,14,20,"To bring about this matter for discussion hath thy eved Yoav done this thing; and adoni is chacham, according to the chochmat malach HaElohim, to know all things that are in ha'aretz."
Shmuel Bais,14,21,"And HaMelech said unto Yoav, Hinei now, I have granted this thing; go therefore, bring the na'ar Avshalom back!"
Shmuel Bais,14,22,"And Yoav fell to the ground on his face, and prostrated himself, and put a bracha on HaMelech; and Yoav said, Today thy eved knoweth that I have found chen in thy sight, adoni, O Melech, in that HaMelech hath fulfilled the request of his eved."
Shmuel Bais,14,23,"So Yoav arose and went to Geshur, and brought Avshalom to Yerushalayim."
Shmuel Bais,14,24,"And HaMelech said, Let him turn to his own bais, and let him not see my face. So Avshalom returned to his own bais, and saw not the face of HaMelech."
Shmuel Bais,14,25,But in kol Yisroel there was none ish yafeh to be so much praised as Avshalom; from the sole of his regel even to the crown of his head there was no mum (blemish) in him.
Shmuel Bais,14,26,"And when he cut the hair of his rosh, (for it was from time to time that he cut it; because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he cut it) ; he weighed the se'ar (hair) of his rosh at two hundred shekels after the royal standard."
Shmuel Bais,14,27,"And unto Avshalom there were born three banim, and one bat, whose shem was Tamar; she was an isha of a fair countenance."
Shmuel Bais,14,28,"So Avshalom dwelt two full shanim in Yerushalayim, and saw not the face of HaMelech."
Shmuel Bais,14,29,"Therefore Avshalom sent for Yoav, to have sent him to HaMelech; but he would not come to him; and when he sent again the second time, he would not come."
Shmuel Bais,14,30,"Therefore he said unto his avadim, See, the allotted land of Yoav is near mine, and he hath se'orim (barley) there; go and kindle it with eish. And the avadim of Avshalom set eish to the allotted land."
Shmuel Bais,14,31,"Then Yoav arose, and came to Avshalom unto his bais, and said unto him, Why have thy avadim set eish to my allotted land?"
Shmuel Bais,14,32,"And Avshalom answered Yoav, Hinei, I sent unto thee, saying, Come here, that I may send thee to HaMelech, to say, why am I come from Geshur? It had been tov (better) for me to have been there still; now therefore let me see the face of HaMelech; and if there be any avon (iniquity) in me, let him kill me."
Shmuel Bais,14,33,"So Yoav came to HaMelech, and told him; and when he had called for Avshalom, he came to HaMelech, and prostrated himself on his face to the ground before HaMelech; and HaMelech kissed Avshalom."
Shmuel Bais,15,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Avshalom prepared him merkavah and susim, and fifty ish to run before him."
Shmuel Bais,15,2,"And Avshalom rose up early, and stood beside the derech hasha'ar; and it was so, that when any ish that had a riv (lawsuit, complaint) came to HaMelech for mishpat, then Avshalom called unto him, and said, Of what town art thou? And he said, Thy eved is of one of the Shivtei Yisroel."
Shmuel Bais,15,3,"And Avshalom said unto him, See, thy case is tovim and right; but there is no man deputy of HaMelech to hear thee."
Shmuel Bais,15,4,"Avshalom said moreover, Oh that I were made Shofet in the land, that every ish which hath any riv or mishpat might come unto me, and I would bring him justice!"
Shmuel Bais,15,5,"And it was so, that when any ish came near to him to prostrate himself before him, he put forth his yad, and took him, and kissed him."
Shmuel Bais,15,6,And on this manner did Avshalom to kol Yisroel that came to HaMelech for mishpat; so Avshalom stole the lev anshei Yisroel.
Shmuel Bais,15,7,"And it came to pass after arba'im shanah, that Avshalom said unto HaMelech, Now let me go and fulfill my neder, which I have vowed unto Hashem , in Chevron."
Shmuel Bais,15,8,"For thy eved vowed a neder (vow) while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Hashem shall bring me again indeed to Yerushalayim, then I will serve Hashem."
Shmuel Bais,15,9,"And HaMelech said unto him, Go in shalom. So he arose, and went to Chevron."
Shmuel Bais,15,10,"But Avshalom sent secret messengers throughout kol Shivtei Yisroel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the shofar, then ye shall say, Avshalom reigneth in Chevron."
Shmuel Bais,15,11,"And with Avshalom went two hundred ish out of Yerushalayim, that were invited; and they went innocently, and they had da'as of not anything."
Shmuel Bais,15,12,"And Avshalom sent for Achitophel the Giloni, Dovidʼs yo'etz (counsellor) , from his town, even from Giloh, while he offered zivakhim. And the kesher (conspiracy) was strong; for the people increased continually with Avshalom."
Shmuel Bais,15,13,"And there came a maggid to Dovid, saying, Lev Ish Yisroel are with Avshalom."
Shmuel Bais,15,14,"And Dovid said unto all his avadim that were with him at Yerushalayim, Arise, and let us flee; or else we shall not escape from Avshalom; make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring ra'ah (disaster) upon us, and strike the Ir with the edge of the cherev."
Shmuel Bais,15,15,"And the avadim of HaMelech said unto HaMelech, Hinei, thy avadim are ready to do whatsoever adoni HaMelech commands."
Shmuel Bais,15,16,"And HaMelech went forth, and all his Bais after him. And HaMelech left ten nashim, which were pilagshim (concubines) , to be shomer over the Bais (palace)."
Shmuel Bais,15,17,"And HaMelech went forth, and kol haAm after him, and tarried in a place that was far off."
Shmuel Bais,15,18,"And all his avadim passed on by his yad; and all the Kereti, and all the Peleti, and all the Gittim, six hundred men which came after him from Gat, passed on before HaMelech."
Shmuel Bais,15,19,"Then said HaMelech to Ittai the Gitti, Why goest thou also with us? Return to thy place, and abide with HaMelech; for thou art a nokhri (foreigner) , and also an exile."
Shmuel Bais,15,20,"Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee wander about with us? Seeing I go to where I may, shuv (return thou) , and take back thy brethren; chesed and emes be with thee."
Shmuel Bais,15,21,"And Ittai answered HaMelech, and said, As Hashem liveth, and as adoni HaMelech liveth, surely in what makom adoni HaMelech shall be, whether in mavet or chayyim, even there also will thy eved be."
Shmuel Bais,15,22,"And Dovid said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gitti passed over, and all his anashim, and all the little ones that were with him."
Shmuel Bais,15,23,"And kol ha'aretz wept with a kol gadol (loud voice) , and kol haAm crossed over; HaMelech also himself crossed over the brook Kidron, and kol haAm crossed over, toward the derech of the midbar."
Shmuel Bais,15,24,"And hinei Tzadok also, and all the Levi'im were with him, bearing the Aron Brit HaElohim; and they set down the Aron HaElohim; and Evyatar (Abiathar) went up, until kol HaAm had done passing out of the Ir."
Shmuel Bais,15,25,"And HaMelech said unto Tzadok, Carry back the Aron HaElohim into the Ir; if I shall find chen (grace) in the eyes of Hashem , He will bring me again, and show me both Him, and His habitation;"
Shmuel Bais,15,26,"But if He thus say, I have no delight in thee; hinei, here am I, let Him do to me as seemeth tov unto Him."
Shmuel Bais,15,27,"HaMelech said also unto Tzadok HaKohen, Art not thou the Ro'eh (seer) ? Return into the Ir in shalom, and your two banim with you, Achima'atz binecha, and Yehonatan Ben Evyatar (Abiathar)."
Shmuel Bais,15,28,"See, I will tarry in the fords of the wilderness, until there come davar from you to inform me."
Shmuel Bais,15,29,Tzadok therefore and Evyatar (Abiathar) carried the Aron HaElohim back to Yerushalayim; and they tarried there.
Shmuel Bais,15,30,"And Dovid went up by the ascent of Ma'aleh HaZeitim (Mount of Olives) , and wept as he went up, and had his rosh covered, and he went barefoot; and kol haAm with him covered every ish his rosh, and they went up, weeping as they went up."
Shmuel Bais,15,31,"And one told Dovid, saying, Achitophel is among the conspirators with Avshalom. And Dovid said, Hashem , turn now the etza (counsel) of Achitophel into foolishness."
Shmuel Bais,15,32,"And it came to pass, that when Dovid was come to the top of the mount, where he worshiped Elohim, hinei, Chushai the Arki came to meet him with his kesones torn, and adamah upon his rosh;"
Shmuel Bais,15,33,"Unto whom Dovid said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a massa (burden) unto me;"
Shmuel Bais,15,34,"But if thou return to the Ir, and say unto Avshalom, I will be thy eved, O melech; as I have been eved avicha hitherto, so will I now also be thy eved; then mayest thou for me bring to nought the etza (counsel) of Achitophel."
Shmuel Bais,15,35,"And hast thou not there with thee Tzadok and Evyatar (Abiathar) the kohanim? Therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the Bais HaMelech, thou shalt tell it to Tzadok and Evyatar (Abiathar) the kohanim."
Shmuel Bais,15,36,"Hinei, they have there with them their two banim, Achima'atz son of Tzadok, and Yehonatan of Evyatar; by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye can hear."
Shmuel Bais,15,37,"So Chushai the re'eh Dovid came into the Ir, and Avshalom came into Yerushalayim."
Shmuel Bais,16,1,"And when Dovid was a little past the top of the hill, hinei, Tziva the na'ar of Mephivoshet met him, with a couple of chamorim saddled, and upon them 200 lechem, and 100 bunches of tzimmukim, and 100 kayitz, and a skin of yayin."
Shmuel Bais,16,2,"And HaMelech said unto Tziva, What meanest thou by these? And Tziva said, The chamorim are for the Bais HaMelech to ride on; and the lechem and kayitz for the ne'arim to eat; and the yayin, that such as be faint in the midbar may drink."
Shmuel Bais,16,3,"And HaMelech said, And where is the ben adoneicha? And Tziva said unto HaMelech, Hinei, he abideth at Yerushalayim; for he said, Today shall Bais Yisroel restore to me the mamlechut avi."
Shmuel Bais,16,4,"Then said HaMelech to Tziva, Hinei, thine are all that pertained unto Mephivoshet. Tziva said, I humbly prostrate myself. May I find chen in thy sight, adoni, O Melech."
Shmuel Bais,16,5,"When Dovid HaMelech came to Bachurim, hinei, from there came out an ish of the mishpakhat Bais Sha'ul; shmo Shime'i Ben Gera; and he, cursing continuously, came."
Shmuel Bais,16,6,"And he cast avanim (stones) at Dovid, and at all the avadim of Dovid HaMelech; and at kol haAm and at all the Gibborim that were on his right and on his left."
Shmuel Bais,16,7,"And thus said Shime'i when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou ish hadamim and thou ish habeliyya'al;"
Shmuel Bais,16,8," Hashem hath returned upon thee all the dahm of the Bais Sha'ul, in whose place thou hast reigned; and Hashem hath delivered the meluchah (kingdom) into the yad Avshalom binecha; and, behold, thou art taken in thy ra'ah, because thou art an ish damim."
Shmuel Bais,16,9,"Then said Avishai Ben Tzeruyah unto HaMelech, Why should this kelev hamet (dead dog) curse adoni HaMelech? Let me go over, now and cut off his rosh."
Shmuel Bais,16,10,"And HaMelech said, What have I to do with you, ye Bnei Tzeruyah? So let him curse, because Hashem hath said unto him, Curse Dovid. Who shall then say, why hast thou done so?"
Shmuel Bais,16,11,"And Dovid said to Avishai, and to all his avadim, Hinei, beni, which came forth from within me, seeketh my nefesh; how much more now may this Ben-HaYemini (Benjamite) do it? Let him alone, and let him curse; for Hashem hath bidden him."
Shmuel Bais,16,12,"It may be that Hashem will look on mine affliction, that Hashem will repay me tovah for his cursing this day."
Shmuel Bais,16,13,"And as Dovid and his anashim went by the derech, Shime'i went along on the hillside opposite him, cursed as he went, threw avanim at him, and kicked up aphar."
Shmuel Bais,16,14,"And HaMelech, and kol HaAm that were with him, arrived weary, and refreshed themselves there."
Shmuel Bais,16,15,"And Avshalom, and kol HaAm Ish Yisroel, came to Yerushalayim, and Achitophel with him."
Shmuel Bais,16,16,"And it came to pass, when Chushai the Arki, re'eh Dovid, was come unto Avshalom, that Chushai said unto Avshalom, Long live HaMelech, Long live HaMelech."
Shmuel Bais,16,17,"And Avshalom said to Chushai, Is this thy chesed (loyal loving-kindness) to thy re'a (friend) ? Why wentest thou not with thy re'a (friend)?"
Shmuel Bais,16,18,"Chushai said unto Avshalom, Lo; but whom Hashem , this people, and kol Ish Yisroel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide."
Shmuel Bais,16,19,"And again, whom should I serve? Should I not serve in the presence of bno? As I have served in the presence of Avicha, so will I be in thy presence."
Shmuel Bais,16,20,"Then said Avshalom to Achitophel, Give etza (counsel, advice, wisdom) among you what we shall do."
Shmuel Bais,16,21,"And Achitophel said unto Avshalom, Go in unto the pilagshim of Avicha, which he hath left to be shomer over the Bais (palace) ; and kol Yisroel shall hear that thou art a stench to Avicha; then shall the hands of all that are with thee be chazak (strong)."
Shmuel Bais,16,22,So they spread Avshalom an ohel upon the gag (roof) ; and Avshalom went in unto the pilagshim of Aviv in the sight of kol Yisroel.
Shmuel Bais,16,23,"And the etza (counsel) of Achitophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if an ish had inquired at the davar HaElohim; so was all the etza (counsel) of Achitophel both with Dovid and with Avshalom."
Shmuel Bais,17,1,"Moreover Achitophel said unto Avshalom, Let me now choose out shneym asar elef ish, and I will arise and pursue after Dovid halailah (this night);"
Shmuel Bais,17,2,"And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak of hands, and will make him tremble with fear; and kol haAm that are with him shall flee; and I will strike HaMelech only;"
Shmuel Bais,17,3,"When I return kol HaAm to you, all except the ish whom thou seekest, it is as if [kol HaAm] returned; so kol haAm shall be in shalom."
Shmuel Bais,17,4,"And the saying pleased Avshalom well, and kol Ziknei Yisroel."
Shmuel Bais,17,5,"Then said Avshalom, Call now Chushai the Arki also, and let us hear likewise from his peh (mouth)."
Shmuel Bais,17,6,"And when Chushai was come to Avshalom, Avshalom spoke unto him, saying, Achitophel hath spoken after this manner; shall we do after his saying? If not; speak thou."
Shmuel Bais,17,7,"And Chushai said unto Avshalom, The etza (counsel) that Achitophel hath given is not tovah at this time."
Shmuel Bais,17,8,"For, said Chushai, thou knowest Avicha and his anashim, that they be Gibborim, and they be enraged in their nefesh, as a dov (bear) robbed of her cubs in the sadeh; and Avicha is ish milchamah, and will not spend the night with HaAm (the troops)."
Shmuel Bais,17,9,"Hinei, he is hid now in one of the pits, or in some other makom; and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the outset, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a magefah (slaughter) among the people that follow Avshalom."
Shmuel Bais,17,10,"And he also that is chayil (valiant) , whose lev is as the lev ha'aryeh (heart of a lion) , shall utterly melt; for kol Yisroel knoweth that Avicha is a Gibbor, and they that be with him are Bnei Chayil (valiant men)."
Shmuel Bais,17,11,"Therefore, I counsel that kol Yisroel be fully gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Be'er-Sheva, as the chol (sand) that is by the yam for multitude; and that thou thyself go into battle in person."
Shmuel Bais,17,12,"So shall we come upon him in some makom where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the tal (dew) falleth on the adamah; and of him and of kol ha'anashim that are with him there shall not be left so much as one."
Shmuel Bais,17,13,"Moreover, if he has withdrawn into a city, then shall kol Yisroel bring chavalim (ropes) to that city, and we will draw it into the ravine, until there be not one small stone found there."
Shmuel Bais,17,14,"And Avshalom and kol Ish Yisroel said, The etza (counsel) of Chushai the Arki is better than the etza of Achitophel. For Hashem had resolved to annul the etza of Achitophel, to the intent that Hashem might bring ra'ah upon Avshalom."
Shmuel Bais,17,15,"Then said Chushai unto Tzadok and to Evyatar (Abiathar) the kohanim, Thus and thus did Achitophel counsel Avshalom and the Ziknei Yisroel; and thus and thus have I counselled."
Shmuel Bais,17,16,"Now therefore send quickly, and tell Dovid, saying, Spend not halailah (this night) in the plains of the midbar, but speedily cross over; lest HaMelech be swallowed up, and kol haAm that are with him."
Shmuel Bais,17,17,Now Yehonatan and Achima'atz stayed by Ein-Rogel; for they dared not be seen to come into the Ir; and a shifchah went and told them; and they went and told Dovid HaMelech.
Shmuel Bais,17,18,"Nevertheless a na'ar saw them, and told Avshalom; but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a bais ish in Bachurim, which had a be'er (well) in his khatzer; to where they went down."
Shmuel Bais,17,19,"And the isha took and spread a masakh (covering, curtain) over the mouth of the be'er, and spread hulled grain thereon; and the thing was not known."
Shmuel Bais,17,20,"And when the avadim of Avshalom came to the bais to the isha, they said, Where is Achima'atz and Yehonatan? And the isha said unto them, They are gone over the brook of mayim. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Yerushalayim."
Shmuel Bais,17,21,"And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they climbed up out of the be'er (well) , and went and told Dovid HaMelech, and said unto Dovid, Arise, and cross quickly over the mayim; for thus hath Achitophel counselled against you."
Shmuel Bais,17,22,"Then Dovid arose, and kol haAm that were with him, and they crossed over Yarden; by the ohr haboker there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Yarden."
Shmuel Bais,17,23,"And when Achitophel saw that his etza (counsel, advice) was not followed, he saddled his chamor, and arose, and went home to his bais, to his town, and put his bais (household) in order, vayyekhanak (and he strangled, hanged himself) , and died, and was buried in the kever aviv (tomb of his father)."
Shmuel Bais,17,24,"Then Dovid came to Machanayim. And Avshalom passed over Yarden, he and all the Ish Yisroel with him."
Shmuel Bais,17,25,"And Avshalom appointed Amasa over the tzava (army) instead of Yoav; now Amasa was ben ish shmo Yitra a Yisroeli, that went in to Avigal Bat Nachash Achot Tzeruyah Em Yoav."
Shmuel Bais,17,26,So Yisroel and Avshalom encamped in Eretz Gil'ad.
Shmuel Bais,17,27,"And it came to pass, when Dovid was come to Machanayim, that Shovi Ben Nachash of Rabbah of the Bnei Ammon, and Machir Ben Ammi'el of Lo-Devar, and Barzillai the Gil'adi of Roglim,"
Shmuel Bais,17,28,"Brought mishkav (bedding) and sappot (bowls) and earthen vessels, and chittim (wheat) , and se'orim (barley) , and kemakh (flour) , and roasted grain, and pol (beans) , and adashim (lentils) , and roasted seeds,"
Shmuel Bais,17,29,"And devash, and khemah (curds) , and tzon, and cheeses of the herd, for Dovid, and for HaAm that were with him, to eat; for they said, HaAm are hungry, and weary, and tzameh (thirsty) , in the midbar."
Shmuel Bais,18,1,"And Dovid mustered HaAm that were with him, and set sarei alafim, and sarei me'ot over them."
Shmuel Bais,18,2,"And Dovid sent forth a third part of the people under the yad Yoav, and a third part under the yad Avishai Ben Tzeruyah (Yoavʼs brother) , and a third part under the yad Ittai the Gitti. And HaMelech said unto HaAm, I will surely go forth with you myself also."
Shmuel Bais,18,3,"But HaAm answered, Thou shalt not go forth; for if we flee away, they will not set their lev on us; neither if half of us die, will they set their lev on us; but now thou art worth ten thousand of us; therefore, now it is better that thou support us from the Ir."
Shmuel Bais,18,4,"And HaMelech said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And HaMelech stood by the side of the sha'ar, and kol haAm came out by hundreds and by thousands."
Shmuel Bais,18,5,"And HaMelech commanded Yoav and Avishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the na'ar, even with Avshalom. And kol HaAm heard when HaMelech gave all the sarim charge concerning Avshalom."
Shmuel Bais,18,6,HaAm went into the sadeh against Yisroel; the milchamah was in ya'ar (forest) of Ephrayim;
Shmuel Bais,18,7,"Where Am Yisroel were slain before the avadim of Dovid, and there was there a magefah gedolah that day of esrim elef."
Shmuel Bais,18,8,For the milchamah was there scattered over the face of kol ha'aretz; and the ya'ar devoured more people that day than the cherev devoured.
Shmuel Bais,18,9,"And Avshalom met the avadim of Dovid. And Avshalom rode upon a pered (mule) , and the pered went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his rosh (head) caught hold of elah (tree, oak) , and he was suspended between HaShomayim and ha'aretz; the pered under him went on."
Shmuel Bais,18,10,"And a certain ish saw it, told Yoav, and said, Hinei, I saw Avshalom talui (hanged) b'elah (on a tree, oak)."
Shmuel Bais,18,11,"And Yoav said unto the ish that told him, And, hinei, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not strike him down to the ground there? And I would have given thee ten shekels of kesef, and a khagorah."
Shmuel Bais,18,12,"And the ish said unto Yoav, Though I should receive elef kesef in mine palm, yet would I not put forth mine yad against the ben HaMelech; for in ozneinu (our hearing) HaMelech charged thee and Avishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the na'ar Avshalom."
Shmuel Bais,18,13,"Otherwise I should have dealt sheker against mine own nefesh; for there is no matter hid from HaMelech, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me."
Shmuel Bais,18,14,"Then said Yoav, I will not tarry thus with thee. And he took three shevatim in his yad, and thrust them through the lev Avshalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak tree."
Shmuel Bais,18,15,"And ten ne'arim that bore the armor of Yoav surrounded Avshalom, struck and slaughtered him."
Shmuel Bais,18,16,"Then Yoav blew the shofar, and HaAm returned from pursuing after Yisroel; for Yoav held back HaAm."
Shmuel Bais,18,17,"And they took Avshalom, and cast him into a great pit in the forest, and laid a very great heap of avanim upon him; and all Yisroel fled, every ish to his ohel."
Shmuel Bais,18,18,"Now Avshalom in his lifetime had taken and erected for himself a matzevet (monument) , which is in the Emek HaMelech; for he said, I have no ben to keep my shem in remembrance; and he called the matzevet after shmo; and it is called unto this day, Avshalomʼs Monument."
Shmuel Bais,18,19,"Then said Achima'atz Ben Tzadok, Let me now run, and take news to HaMelech, how that Hashem hath in justice vindicated him of his oyevim."
Shmuel Bais,18,20,"And Yoav said unto him, Thou shalt not be ish besorah (bearer of news) this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the ben HaMelech is dead."
Shmuel Bais,18,21,"Then said Yoav to Cushi, Go tell HaMelech what thou hast seen. And Cushi prostrated himself unto Yoav, and ran."
Shmuel Bais,18,22,"Then said Achima'atz Ben Tzadok yet again to Yoav, But be what may, let me, now, also run after Cushi. And Yoav said, why wilt thou run, beni, seeing that thou hast no besorah to provide?"
Shmuel Bais,18,23,"But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Rutz! (run!) . Then Achima'atz ran by the derech of the plain, outran Cushi."
Shmuel Bais,18,24,"And Dovid sat between the two she'arim (gates) ; and the tzofeh (watchman) went up to the gag (roof) over the sha'ar (gate) unto the chomah (wall) , and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and hinei an ish running alone."
Shmuel Bais,18,25,"And the tzofeh (watchman) cried, and told HaMelech. And HaMelech said, If he be alone, there is besorah (news) in his peh (mouth) . And he came rapidly, and drew near."
Shmuel Bais,18,26,"And the tzofeh (watchman) saw another man running; and the tzofeh called unto the sho'er (gatekeeper) , and said, Hinei, another man running alone. And HaMelech said, This is mevaser (one bringing good news, evangelist)."
Shmuel Bais,18,27,"And the tzofeh (watchman) said, I see the running of the foremost is like the running of Achima'atz Ben Tzadok. And HaMelech said, He is an ish tov, and cometh with besorah tovah (good news)."
Shmuel Bais,18,28,"And Achima'atz called, and said unto HaMelech, Shalom. And he fell down to ha'aretz upon his face before HaMelech, and said, Baruch Hashem Eloheicha, which hath delivered up the anashim that lifted up their yad against adoni HaMelech."
Shmuel Bais,18,29,"And HaMelech said, Is the na'ar Avshalom, shalom? And Achima'atz answered, When Yoav sent eved HaMelech, avdecha, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was."
Shmuel Bais,18,30,"And HaMelech said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still."
Shmuel Bais,18,31,"And, hinei, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Yitbaser (be informed of news) , adoni HaMelech; for Hashem hath in justice vindicated thee this day from the yad of all them that rose up against thee."
Shmuel Bais,18,32,"And HaMelech said unto Cushi, Is the na'ar Avshalom shalom? And Cushi answered, The enemies of adoni HaMelech, and all that rise against thee to do thee harm, be as that na'ar is."
Shmuel Bais,18,33,"And HaMelech was much moved, and went up to the aliyyat hasha'ar (upper room over the gate) and wept; and as he went, thus he said, O beni (my son) Avshalom, beni, beni Avshalom! If only I had died tachteicha (in place of, instead of) thee, O Avshalom, beni, beni!"
Shmuel Bais,19,1,"And it was told Yoav, Hinei, HaMelech weepeth and mourneth for Avshalom."
Shmuel Bais,19,2,"And the teshu'ah (salvation, deliverance) on that day was turned into evel (mourning) unto kol HaAm; for the people heard say that day how HaMelech was grieved for bno Avshalom."
Shmuel Bais,19,3,And the people stole that day into the Ir as people being ashamed steal in when they flee in milchamah.
Shmuel Bais,19,4,"But HaMelech covered his face, and HaMelech cried with a kol gadol, O beni Avshalom, O Avshalom, beni, beni!"
Shmuel Bais,19,5,"And Yoav came into the bais to HaMelech, and said, Thou hast disgraced this day the faces of all thy avadim, which this day have saved thy nefesh, and the nefesh of thy banim and of thy banot, and the nefesh of thy nashim, and the nefesh of thy pilagshim (concubines);"
Shmuel Bais,19,6,"In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou hast no regard for sarim nor avadim; for this day I perceive, that if Avshalom had lived, and this day all we were mesim (dead ones) , then it would have been yashar in thy sight."
Shmuel Bais,19,7,"Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak to the lev unto thy avadim; for I swear by Hashem , if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one ish with thee halailah (this night) ; and that will be worse unto thee than kol hara'ah that befell thee from thy youth until now."
Shmuel Bais,19,8,"Then HaMelech arose, and sat in the sha'ar. And they told unto kol haAm, saying, Hinei, HaMelech doth sit in the sha'ar. And kol haAm came before HaMelech: for Yisroel had fled every ish to his ohel."
Shmuel Bais,19,9,"And kol haAm were having dissension throughout kol Shivtei Yisroel saying, HaMelech saved us out of the palm of oyveinu (our enemies) and he delivered us out of the palm of the Pelishtim; and now he is fled from HaAretz because of Avshalom."
Shmuel Bais,19,10,"And Avshalom, whom mashachnu (we anointed) over us, is dead in milchamah. Now therefore why are ye not speaking of bringing back HaMelech?"
Shmuel Bais,19,11,"And Dovid HaMelech sent to Tzadok and to Evyatar the kohanim, saying, Speak unto the Ziknei Yehudah, saying, Why are ye the last ones to bring HaMelech back to his Bais? Seeing the talk of kol Yisroel is come to HaMelech, even to his Bais."
Shmuel Bais,19,12,"Ye are my brethren, ye are my atzmot and my basar; why then are ye the last ones to bring back HaMelech?"
Shmuel Bais,19,13,"And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my etzem, and of my basar? Elohim do so to me, and more also, if thou be not sar tzava before me continually in place of Yoav."
Shmuel Bais,19,14,"And he swayed the levav kol Ish Yehudah, even as the lev of one man; so that they sent this word unto HaMelech, Return thou, and all thy avadim."
Shmuel Bais,19,15,"So HaMelech returned, and came to Yarden. And Yehudah came to Gilgal, to go to meet HaMelech, to conduct HaMelech over Yarden."
Shmuel Bais,19,16,"And Shime'i Ben Gera, a Ben-HaYemini, which was of Bachurim, hasted and came down with the Ish Yehudah to meet Dovid HaMelech."
Shmuel Bais,19,17,"And there were an elef ish of Binyamin with him, and Tziva the na'ar of the Bais Sha'ul, and his fifteen banim and his twenty avadim with him; and they went over Yarden before HaMelech."
Shmuel Bais,19,18,"And there went over a ferry to carry over the Bais HaMelech, and to do what he thought good. And Shime'i Ben Gera fell down before HaMelech, as he was come over Yarden;"
Shmuel Bais,19,19,"And said unto HaMelech, Let not adoni impute avon (iniquity) unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy eved did perversely the day that adoni HaMelech went out of Yerushalayim, that HaMelech should take it to his lev."
Shmuel Bais,19,20,"For thy eved doth know that I have sinned; therefore, hinei, I am come rishom (first) this day of all the Bais Yosef to go down to meet adoni HaMelech."
Shmuel Bais,19,21,"But Avishai Ben Tzeruyah answered and said, Shall not Shime'i be put to death for this, because he cursed Hashem ʼs Moshiach?"
Shmuel Bais,19,22,"And Dovid said, What have I to do with you, ye Bnei Tzeruyah, that ye should this day be as satan unto me? Shall there be ish put to death this day in Yisroel? For do not I know that I am this day Melech al Yisroel?"
Shmuel Bais,19,23,"Therefore HaMelech said unto Shime'i, Thou shalt not die. And HaMelech swore a shevu'a unto him."
Shmuel Bais,19,24,"And Mephivoshet Ben Sha'ul came down to meet HaMelech, and had neither bathed his regal, nor trimmed his safam (mustache) , nor washed his clothes, from the day HaMelech departed until the day he came again in shalom."
Shmuel Bais,19,25,"And it came to pass, when he was come to Yerushalayim to meet HaMelech, that HaMelech said unto him, why wentest not thou with me, Mephivoshet?"
Shmuel Bais,19,26,"And he answered, Adoni, O Melech, avdi deceived me: for thy eved said, I will saddle me a chamor, that I may ride thereon, and go to HaMelech; because thy eved is pise'ach (lame)."
Shmuel Bais,19,27,And he hath slandered thy eved unto adoni HaMelech; but adoni HaMelech is like malach HaElohim; do therefore what is tov in thine eyes.
Shmuel Bais,19,28,For all of the bais avi were but anshei mavet before adoni HaMelech; yet didst thou set thy eved among them that did eat at thine own shulchan. What tzedakah (right) therefore have I yet to appeal any more unto HaMelech?
Shmuel Bais,19,29,"And HaMelech said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy devarim? I have said, Thou and Tziva divide the sadeh."
Shmuel Bais,19,30,"And Mephivoshet said unto HaMelech, Indeed, let him take all, forasmuch as adoni HaMelech is come again in shalom unto his own bais."
Shmuel Bais,19,31,"And Barzillai the Gil'adi came down from Roglim, and went over Yarden with HaMelech, to conduct him over Yarden."
Shmuel Bais,19,32,"Now Barzillai was zaken me'od, even fourscore shanah; and he had been the support of HaMelech while he dwelt at Machanayim; for he was an ish gadol me'od."
Shmuel Bais,19,33,"HaMelech said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and with me I will be your support in Yerushalayim."
Shmuel Bais,19,34,"And Barzillai said unto HaMelech, How long have I to live, that I should go up with HaMelech to Yerushalayim?"
Shmuel Bais,19,35,I am this day fourscore shanah old; and can I discern between tov and rah? Can thy eved taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of sharim (singing men) and sharot (singing women) ? Why then should thy eved be yet a massa (burden) unto adoni HaMelech?
Shmuel Bais,19,36,Thy eved will go a little way over Yarden with HaMelech; and why should HaMelech reward me with such a reward?
Shmuel Bais,19,37,"Let thy eved, now, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried near the kever of avi and of immi. But hinei thy eved Kimham; let him go over with adoni HaMelech; and do to him what shall seem tov unto thee."
Shmuel Bais,19,38,"And HaMelech answered, Kimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him that which shall seem tov unto thee; and whatsoever thou shalt request of me, that will I do for thee."
Shmuel Bais,19,39,"And kol haAm crossed over Yarden. And when HaMelech was come over, HaMelech kissed Barzillai, and put a bracha on him; and he returned unto his own makom (place, home)."
Shmuel Bais,19,40,"Then HaMelech went on to Gilgal, and Kimhan crossed over with him; and kol Am Yehudah conducted HaMelech, and also half Am Yisroel."
Shmuel Bais,19,41,"And, hinei, kol Ish Yisroel came to HaMelech, and said unto HaMelech, Why have acheinu Ish Yehudah stolen thee away, and have brought HaMelech across, and his Bais (household) , and kol Anshei Dovid with him, over Yarden?"
Shmuel Bais,19,42,"And kol Ish Yehudah answered Ish Yisroel, Because HaMelech is near of kin to us; why then be ye angry for this matter? Have we eaten at all from HaMelech? Or hath he given us anything?"
Shmuel Bais,19,43,"And Ish Yisroel answered the Ish Yehudah, and said, We have ten shares as much in HaMelech, and we have also more in Dovid than ye; why then did ye slight us? Were we not the first to give the davar in bringing back my melech? And the devar Ish Yehudah were harsher than the devar Ish Yisroel."
Shmuel Bais,20,1,"And there happened to be there an ish Beliyaal, shmo Sheva Ben Bikhri an ish from Binyamin; and he blew a shofar, and said, We have no chelek in Dovid, neither have we nachalah in Ben Yishai; every ish to his ohel, O Yisroel."
Shmuel Bais,20,2,"So kol Ish Yisroel went up from after Dovid, and followed Sheva Ben Bikhri; but the Ish Yehudah had deveykus unto their Melech, from Yarden even to Yerushalayim."
Shmuel Bais,20,3,"And Dovid came to his Bais (palace) at Yerushalayim; and HaMelech took the ten nashim, his pilagshim, whom he had left to be shomer over the Bais, and put them in Bais Mishmeret (seclusion) , and provided for them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto their yom mot, living in almenut (widowhood)."
Shmuel Bais,20,4,"Then said HaMelech to Amasa, Assemble the Ish Yehudah within shloshet yamim; be thou here present."
Shmuel Bais,20,5,So Amasa went to assemble Yehudah; but he tarried longer than the mo'ed which he had appointed him.
Shmuel Bais,20,6,"And Dovid said to Avishai, Now shall Sheva Ben Bikhri do us more harm than did Avshalom; take thou the avadim of adoneicha, pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape us."
Shmuel Bais,20,7,"And there went out after him anshei Yoav, and the Kereti, and the Peleti, and kol Gibborim; and they went out of Yerushalayim, to pursue after Sheva Ben Bikhri."
Shmuel Bais,20,8,"When they were at the Even Hagedolah (Great Stone) which is in Giv'on, Amasa went before them. And Yoavʼs military garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a khagor with a cherev fastened upon his waist in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out."
Shmuel Bais,20,9,"Yoav said to Amasa, Art thou in shalom, my brother? And Yoav took Amasa by the zaken (beard) with the right hand to kiss him."
Shmuel Bais,20,10,"But Amasa took no heed to the cherev that was in the yad Yoav; so he stabbed him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Yoav and Avishai achiv pursued after Sheva Ben Bikhri."
Shmuel Bais,20,11,"And one of the nearim of Yoav stood by him, and said, He that favoreth Yoav, and he that is for Dovid, let him go after Yoav."
Shmuel Bais,20,12,"And Amasa wallowed in dahm in the midst of the mesilah (road) . And when the ish saw that kol haAm halted, he removed Amasa out of the mesilah into the sadeh, and threw a beged (garment) over him, when he saw that every one that came by him halted."
Shmuel Bais,20,13,"When he was removed from the mesilah, kol haAm went on after Yoav, to pursue after Sheva Ben Bikhri."
Shmuel Bais,20,14,"And he passed through all the Shivtei Yisroel unto Abel, and to Beit-Ma'achah, and all the Berim; and they were gathered together, and went also after him."
Shmuel Bais,20,15,"And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beit-Ma'achah, and they cast up a siege ramp against the Ir, until it stood by the rampart; and kol haAm that were with Yoav battered the chomah (wall) , to throw it down."
Shmuel Bais,20,16,"Then cried an isha chachamah (wise woman) from the Ir, Hear, hear; say, now unto Yoav, Come here, that I may speak with thee."
Shmuel Bais,20,17,"And when he was come near unto her, the isha said, Art thou Yoav? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the devarim of thine amah. And he answered, I do hear."
Shmuel Bais,20,18,"Then she spoke, saying, They used to speak in rishonah (old times) , saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel; and so they settled the matter."
Shmuel Bais,20,19,I am one of them that are of shalom and of emunah in Yisroel; thou seekest to destroy an Ir and an em b'Yisroel; why wilt thou swallow up the nachalat Hashem?
Shmuel Bais,20,20,"And Yoav answered and said, Chalilah (far be it) , chalilah from me, that I should swallow up or destroy."
Shmuel Bais,20,21,"The matter is not so; but an ish of har Ephrayim, Sheva Ben Bikhri shmo, hath lifted up his yad against HaMelech, even against Dovid; hand over him only, and I will depart from the Ir. And the woman said unto Yoav, Hinei, his rosh shall be thrown to thee from the chomah."
Shmuel Bais,20,22,"Then the isha went unto kol haAm in her chochmah. And they cut off the rosh of Sheva Ben Bikhri, and threw it out to Yoav. And he blew a shofar, and they retired from the city, every ish to his ohel. And Yoav returned to Yerushalayim unto HaMelech."
Shmuel Bais,20,23,Now Yoav was over kol HaTzava Yisroel; and Benayah Ben Yehoyada was over the Kereti and over the Peleti;
Shmuel Bais,20,24,And Adoram was over the forced labor; and Yehoshaphat Ben Achilud was mazkir (secretary);
Shmuel Bais,20,25,And Sheva was sofer; and Tzadok and Evyatar (Abiathar) were the kohanim;
Shmuel Bais,20,26,And also Ira the Yairi was kohen to Dovid.
Shmuel Bais,21,1,"Then there was a ra'av (famine) in the days of Dovid shalosh shanim, shanah after shanah; and Dovid inquired of Hashem . And Hashem answered, It is on account of Sha'ul, and for his bais hadamim, because he slaughtered the Giv'onim."
Shmuel Bais,21,2,"And HaMelech called the Giv'onim, and said unto them; (now the Giveonim were not of the Bnei Yisroel, but of the remnant of the Emori; and the Bnei Yisroel had sworn unto them; and Sha'ul sought to annihilate them in his kinot (zeal) for the Bnei Yisroel and Yehudah.)"
Shmuel Bais,21,3,"Therefore Dovid said unto the Giv'onim, What shall I do for you? And wherewith shall I make the kapporah, that ye may bless the nachalat Hashem?"
Shmuel Bais,21,4,"And the Giv'onim said unto him, We will have no kesef nor zahav of Sha'ul, nor of his bais; neither for us shalt thou kill any ish in Yisroel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you."
Shmuel Bais,21,5,"And they answered HaMelech, The ish that consumed us, and that plotted against us that we should be made shmad from remaining in any of the territories of Yisroel,"
Shmuel Bais,21,6,"Let shivah anashim of his banim be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto Hashem in Giv'ah of Sha'ul, whom Hashem did choose. And HaMelech said, I will give them."
Shmuel Bais,21,7,"But HaMelech spared Mephivoshet Ben Yonatan Ben Sha'ul, because of Hashem ʼs shevua (oath) that was between them, between Dovid and Yonatan Ben Sha'ul."
Shmuel Bais,21,8,"But HaMelech took the two Bnei Ritzpah Bat Ayah, whom she bore unto Sha'ul, Armoni and Mephivoshet; and the five Bnei Michal Bat Sha'ul, whom she bore to Adriel Ben Barzillai the Mecholati;"
Shmuel Bais,21,9,"And he delivered them into the hands of the Giveonim, and they hanged them in the hill before Hashem ; and they fell all shivah together and were put to death in the yamim of katzir (harvest) , in the rishonim, in the beginning of katzir se'orim (barley harvest)."
Shmuel Bais,21,10,"And Ritzpah Bat Ayah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the tzur, from the beginning of katzir until mayim dropped upon them out of Shomayim, and suffered neither the oph haShomayim to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the sadeh by night."
Shmuel Bais,21,11,"And it was told Dovid what Ritzpah Bat Ayah, the pilegesh (concubine) of Sha'ul, had done."
Shmuel Bais,21,12,"And Dovid went and took the atzmot Sha'ul and the atzmot Yonatan bno from the citizens of Yavesh-Gil'ad, which had stolen them from the rechov (street) of Beit-Shan, where the Pelishtim had hanged them, when the Pelishtim had slain Sha'ul in Gilboa;"
Shmuel Bais,21,13,And he brought up from there the atzmot Sha'ul and the atzmot Yonatan bno; and they gathered the atzmot of them that were hanged.
Shmuel Bais,21,14,"And the atzmot Sha'ul and Yonatan bno buried they in eretz Binyamin in Tzela, in the kever of Kish aviv; and they performed all that HaMelech commanded. And after that Elohim was entreated for the land."
Shmuel Bais,21,15,"Moreover the Pelishtim had yet milchamah again with Yisroel; and Dovid went down, and his avadim with him, and fought against the Pelishtim; and Dovid grew faint."
Shmuel Bais,21,16,"And Yishbi-benov, which was of the yeladim of Rafah (Giant) , the weight of whose spearhead weighed three hundred shekels of nechoshet in weight, he being girded chadashah (belted anew) , declared that he could slay Dovid."
Shmuel Bais,21,17,"But Avishai Ben Tzeruyah came to his aid, and struck the Pelishti (Philistine) , and killed him. Then the anshei Dovid swore an oath unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to milchamah (battle) , that thou quench not the Ner Yisroel (Lamp of Israel)."
Shmuel Bais,21,18,"And it came to pass after this, that there was again milchamah with the Pelishtim at Gov; then Sibbekhai the Chushati slaughtered Saph, which was of the banim of the Rafah."
Shmuel Bais,21,19,"And there was again milchamah in Gov with the Pelishtim, where Elchanan Ben Ya'arei-Orgim, from Beit-Lechem, slaughtered the brother of Golyat (Goliath) the Gitti, the staff of whose khanit (spear) was like a weaverʼs beam."
Shmuel Bais,21,20,"And there was yet again a milchamah in Gat, where was a man of great stature, that had on every yad six fingers, and on every regel six toes, four and twenty in mispar (number) ; and he also was born to the Rafah."
Shmuel Bais,21,21,"And when he defied Yisroel, Yehonatan Ben Shime'ah the brother of Dovid slaughtered him."
Shmuel Bais,21,22,"These four were born to the Rafah in Gat, and fell by the yad Dovid, and by the yad of his avadim."
Shmuel Bais,22,1,And Dovid spoke unto Hashem the devarim of this shirah (song) in the day that Hashem had delivered him out of the palm of all his oyevim (enemies) and out of the palm of Sha'ul:
Shmuel Bais,22,2,"And he said, Hashem is my rock, and my matzadah, and my deliverer;"
Shmuel Bais,22,3,"The Elohei (G-d of) my Tzur; in Him will I trust; He is my mogen, and the keren of my Salvation, my stronghold, and my refuge, my Moshia; Thou savest me from chamas."
Shmuel Bais,22,4,"I will call on Hashem , Who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be saved from my oyevim."
Shmuel Bais,22,5,"When the waves of mavet (death) compassed me, the floods of scoundrels overwhelm me;"
Shmuel Bais,22,6,The chevlei Sheol (cords of Sheol) encompassed me; the snares of mavet confronted me;
Shmuel Bais,22,7,"In my distress I called upon Hashem , and cried to Elohai; and He did hear my voice out of His Heikhal, and my cry did enter into His oznayim."
Shmuel Bais,22,8,"Then ha'aretz shook and trembled; the mosedot (foundations) of Shomayim moved and shook, because He was in wrath."
Shmuel Bais,22,9,"There went up an ashan (smoke) out of His nostrils, and eish out of His peh (mouth) devoured; coals were kindled by it."
Shmuel Bais,22,10,"He bowed HaShomayim also, and came down; and a dark cloud was under His raglayim."
Shmuel Bais,22,11,"And He rode upon a keruv, and did fly; and He was seen upon the wings of the ruach."
Shmuel Bais,22,12,"And He made choshech sukkot round about Him, dark mayim, and thick clouds of the skies."
Shmuel Bais,22,13,Through the radiant brightness before Him were coals of eish kindled.
Shmuel Bais,22,14," Hashem thundered from Shomayim, and Elyon uttered His voice."
Shmuel Bais,22,15,"He sent out khitzim, and scattered them; lightning, and vanquished them."
Shmuel Bais,22,16,"And the channels of the yam appeared, the mosedot (foundations) of the tevel (world) were uncovered, at the rebuking of Hashem , at the blast of the ruach of His nostrils."
Shmuel Bais,22,17,"He sent from on High, He took me; He drew me out of mayim rabbim;"
Shmuel Bais,22,18,"He delivered me from my strong oyev, and from them that hated me; for they were too strong for me."
Shmuel Bais,22,19,They confronted me in the day of my calamity; but Hashem was my support.
Shmuel Bais,22,20,"He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because chafetz (He delighted) in me."
Shmuel Bais,22,21, Hashem rewarded me according to my tzedakah; according to the cleanness of my hands hath He recompensed me.
Shmuel Bais,22,22,"For I have been shomer over the drakhei Hashem , and have not wickedly departed from Elohai."
Shmuel Bais,22,23,"For all His mishpatim were before me; as for His chukkot, I did not depart from them."
Shmuel Bais,22,24,"I was also tamim (blameless) before Him, and have kept myself from mine avon (iniquity)."
Shmuel Bais,22,25,Therefore Hashem hath rewarded me according to my tzedakah; according to my cleanness before His eyesight.
Shmuel Bais,22,26,"With the chasid (loyal, the one having chesed, the devout one) Thou wilt show Thyself loyal, and with the Gibbor tamim (blameless man) Thou wilt show Thyself blameless."
Shmuel Bais,22,27,"With the pure Thou wilt show Thyself pure; and with the ikkesh (crooked, devious) Thou wilt show Thyself shrewd."
Shmuel Bais,22,28,"And the Am oni (afflicted people) Thou wilt save; but Thine eyes are upon the haughty, that Thou mayest bring them down."
Shmuel Bais,22,29,"For Thou art my ner (lamp), Hashem ; and Hashem will lighten my choshech."
Shmuel Bais,22,30,For by Thee I have run through a troop; by Elohai can I leap over a wall.
Shmuel Bais,22,31,"As for G-d, His derech is tamim; the Word of Hashem is proven; He is a mogen (shield) to all them that trust in Him."
Shmuel Bais,22,32,"For who is G-d, save Hashem ? And who is Tzur, save Eloheinu?"
Shmuel Bais,22,33,G-d is my ma'oz and power; and He maketh my derech perfect.
Shmuel Bais,22,34,He maketh my feet like the feet of ayyalot (deer) ; and maketh me stand upon my high places.
Shmuel Bais,22,35,He teacheth my yadayim for milchamah; so that a keshet nechoshah is bent by mine arms.
Shmuel Bais,22,36,Thou hast also given me the mogen of Thy Salvation; and hath stooped down to make me great.
Shmuel Bais,22,37,Thou hast enlarged my stride under me; so that my karsulayim do not slip.
Shmuel Bais,22,38,"I have pursued mine oyevim, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them."
Shmuel Bais,22,39,"And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise; indeed, they are fallen under my raglayim."
Shmuel Bais,22,40,For Thou hast girded me with chayil (strength) for milchamah (battle) ; them that rose up against me hast Thou caused to bow down under me.
Shmuel Bais,22,41,"Thou hast also given me victory over the necks of mine oyevim, that I might destroy them that hate me."
Shmuel Bais,22,42,"They looked, but there was no moshia; even unto Hashem , but He answered them not."
Shmuel Bais,22,43,"Then did I beat them as small as the aphar of eretz, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did scatter them abroad."
Shmuel Bais,22,44,"Thou also hast delivered me from the contentions of my people, Thou hast kept me to be Rosh of the Goyim; a people which I knew not shall serve me."
Shmuel Bais,22,45,"Foreigners shall submit themselves unto me; as soon as they hear, they shall be mishma'at (obedient) unto me."
Shmuel Bais,22,46,"Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their misgerot (strongholds)."
Shmuel Bais,22,47, Hashem liveth; and baruch be my Tzur; and exalted be the Elohei Tzur of my Salvation.
Shmuel Bais,22,48,"It is G-d that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the nations under me."
Shmuel Bais,22,49,And that bringeth me forth from mine oyevim; Thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me; Thou hast delivered me from the ish chamasim.
Shmuel Bais,22,50,"Therefore I will give thanks unto Thee, Hashem , among the Goyim, and I will sing praises unto Shimecha (Thy Name)."
Shmuel Bais,22,51,"He is the migdal Yeshu'ot for His melech; and showeth chesed to His Moshiach, unto Dovid, and to his zera ad-olam."
Shmuel Bais,23,1,"Now these be the last devarim of Dovid. Dovid Ben Yishai said, the gever (man) who was raised up above, the Moshiach Elohei Ya'akov, and the singer of zemirot (songs) of Yisroel, said,"
Shmuel Bais,23,2,"The Ruach Hashem spoke by me, and His word was on my leshon."
Shmuel Bais,23,3,"The Elohei Yisroel said, the Tzur Yisroel spoke to me, He that ruleth over adam, Tzaddik, ruling in the yirat Elohim."
Shmuel Bais,23,4,"And He shall be as the ohr of the boker, when the shemesh riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender deshe (grass) springing out of ha'aretz by clear shining after matar (rain)."
Shmuel Bais,23,5,"Is not my Bais so with G-d? Yet He hath made with me a Brit Olam, ordered in all things, and sure; for this is all my salvation, and all my chefetz (desire) , will He not make it spring forth (tzemach)?"
Shmuel Bais,23,6,"But the Bnei Beliyaal shall be all of them as kotz (thorns) thrust away, because they cannot be gathered with hands;"
Shmuel Bais,23,7,But the one that shall touch them must be armed with barzel (iron) and the staff of a khanit (spear) ; and they shall be utterly burned with eish where they are.
Shmuel Bais,23,8,"These be the shmot of the gibborim whom Dovid had; Yoshev Bashevet Tachkemoni, chief among the Three; the same was Adino the Etzni; he killed eight hundred, in one encounter."
Shmuel Bais,23,9,"And after him was El'azar Ben Dodo the Achochi, one of the three gibborim with Dovid, when they defied the Pelishtim that were there gathered together to milchamah, and the Ish Yisroel were gone away;"
Shmuel Bais,23,10,"He arose, and struck the Pelishtim until his yad was weary, and his yad had devekyus unto the cherev; and Hashem wrought a teshuah gedolah (great victory) that day; and the people returned after him only to plunder."
Shmuel Bais,23,11,"And after him was Shammah Ben Agee the Harari. And the Pelishtim were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Pelishtim."
Shmuel Bais,23,12,"But he stood in the midst of the allotted ground, and defended it, and slaughtered the Pelishtim; and Hashem wrought a teshuah gedolah."
Shmuel Bais,23,13,"And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to Dovid in the time of katzir unto the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Pelishtim encamped in the Emek Repha'im."
Shmuel Bais,23,14,"And Dovid was then in the matzadah, and the garrison of the Pelishtim was then in Beit-Lechem."
Shmuel Bais,23,15,"And Dovid longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the mayim of the well of Beit-Lechem, which is by the sha'ar!"
Shmuel Bais,23,16,"And the three gibborim broke through the machaneh of the Pelishtim, and drew mayim out of the well of Beit-Lechem, that was by the sha'ar, and took it, and brought it to Dovid; nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto Hashem."
Shmuel Bais,23,17,"And he said, Chalilah! (be it far from me), Hashem , that I should do this! Is not this the dahm of the anashim that went in jeopardy of their nafshot? Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three gibborim,"
Shmuel Bais,23,18,"And Avishai, the brother of Yoav Ben Tzeruyah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his khanit (spear) against three hundred, and slaughtered them, and had the shem among the Three."
Shmuel Bais,23,19,Was he not most honored of the Three? Therefore he was their sar; howbeit he attained not unto the first three.
Shmuel Bais,23,20,"And Benayah Ben Yehoyada was a ben chayil, of Kavtze'el, who had done many deeds: he slaughtered two lionlike men of Moav; he went down also and slaughtered an aryeh in the midst of a pit on a snowy day;"
Shmuel Bais,23,21,"And he slaughtered an Egyptian, a goodly man; and the Egyptian had a khanit (spear) in his yad; but he went down to him with a shevet (club) , and plucked the khanit out of the Egyptianʼs yad, and slaughtered him with his own khanit."
Shmuel Bais,23,22,"These things did Benayah Ben Yehoyada, and had the shem among three gibborim."
Shmuel Bais,23,23,"He was more honored than the Shloshim, but he attained not to the first Three. And Dovid set him over his bodyguard."
Shmuel Bais,23,24,"Asahel the brother of Yoav was one of the thirty; Elchanan Ben Dodo of Beit-Lechem,"
Shmuel Bais,23,25,"Shammah the Harodi, Elika the Charodi,"
Shmuel Bais,23,26,"Cheletz the Palti, Ira Ben Ikkesh the Tekoi,"
Shmuel Bais,23,27,"Avi'ezer the Anetoti, Mevunai the Chushati,"
Shmuel Bais,23,28,"Tzalmon the Achochi, Maharai the Netophati,"
Shmuel Bais,23,29,"Chelev Ben Ba'anah, a Netophati, Ittai Ben Rivai out of Giv'ah of the Bnei Binyamin,"
Shmuel Bais,23,30,"Benayah the Pir'athoni, Hiddai of the ravines of Ga'ash,"
Shmuel Bais,23,31,"Avi-Alvon the Arvati, Azmavet the Barchumi,"
Shmuel Bais,23,32,"Elyachba the Sha'alboni, of the Bnei Yashen, Yehonatan,"
Shmuel Bais,23,33,"Shammah the Harari, Achiam Ben Sharar the Arari,"
Shmuel Bais,23,34,"Eliphelet Ben Achasbai son of the Ma'akhati, Eli'am Ben Achitophel the Giloni,"
Shmuel Bais,23,35,"Chetzrai the Karmeli, Pa'arai the Arbi,"
Shmuel Bais,23,36,"Yigal Ben Natan of Tzovah, Bani the Gadi,"
Shmuel Bais,23,37,"Tzelek the Ammoni, Nachrai the Be'eroti, armorbearer to Yoav Ben Tzeruyah,"
Shmuel Bais,23,38,"Ira a Yitri, Garev a Yitri,"
Shmuel Bais,23,39,Uriyah the Chitti; 37 in all.
Shmuel Bais,24,1,"And again the Af Hashem was kindled against Yisroel, and He incited Dovid against them to say, Go, number Yisroel and Yehudah."
Shmuel Bais,24,2,"For HaMelech said to Yoav Sar HaChayil, who was with him, Go now through kol Shivtei Yisroel, from Dan even to Be'er-Sheva, and number ye HaAm, that I may know the Mispar HaAm."
Shmuel Bais,24,3,"And Yoav said unto HaMelech, Now Hashem Eloheicha add unto HaAm, how many soever they be, a hundredfold, and that the eyes of adoni HaMelech may see it; but why doth adoni HaMelech delight in this thing?"
Shmuel Bais,24,4,"Notwithstanding the devar HaMelech prevailed against Yoav, and against the Sarei HeChayil. And Yoav and the Sarei HaChayil went out from before HaMelech, to number HaAm Yisroel."
Shmuel Bais,24,5,"And they passed over Yarden, encamped in Aro'er, on the south of the Ir that lieth in the middle of the ravine of Gad, toward Yazer;"
Shmuel Bais,24,6,"Then they came to Gil'ad, to Eretz Tachtim-Chodshi; they came to Dan-Ya'an, went around to Tzidon,"
Shmuel Bais,24,7,"And came to the fortress of Tzor, and to all the cities of the Chivi, and of Kena'ani; and they went out to the Negev of Yehudah, to Be'er-Sheva."
Shmuel Bais,24,8,"So when they had gone through kol HaAretz, they came to Yerushalayim at the end of 9 months and 20 days."
Shmuel Bais,24,9,And Yoav gave up the sum of the number of HaAm unto HaMelech; and there were in Yisroel Shmoneh Me'ot Elef ish chayil that drew the cherev; and the Ish Yehudah were chamesh Me'ot Elef ish.
Shmuel Bais,24,10,"And the lev Dovid struck him after that he had numbered HaAm. And Dovid said unto Hashem , Chatati (I have sinned) me'od (greatly) in what I have done; and now, Hashem , take away the avon (iniquity, guilt) of Thy eved; for I have done very foolishly."
Shmuel Bais,24,11,"For when Dovid rose up in the boker, the Devar Hashem came unto Gad HaNavi, the Chozeh Dovid (Seer of Dovid) , saying,"
Shmuel Bais,24,12,"Go, say unto Dovid, Thus saith Hashem , I offer thee shalosh (three, three things) ; choose for thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee."
Shmuel Bais,24,13,"So Gad came to Dovid, and told him, and said unto him, Shall shalosh shanim of ra'av (famine) come unto thee in thy land? Or wilt thou flee shloshah chodashim before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? Or that there be shloshet yamim dever (three days of pestilence) in thy land? Now consider, and see what answer I shall return to Him that sent me."
Shmuel Bais,24,14,"And Dovid said unto Gad, I am in a great tzar (distress) ; let us fall now into the Yad Hashem ; for His rachamim are rabbim: and let me not fall into the yad adam."
Shmuel Bais,24,15,So Hashem sent a dever (pestilence) upon Yisroel from the boker even to the es mo'ed (time appointed) ; and there died of HaAm from Dan even to Be'er-Sheva shiv'im elef ish.
Shmuel Bais,24,16,"And when the Malach stretched out his yad upon Yerushalayim to destroy her, Hashem relented from the destruction, and said to the Malach that destroyed HaAm, It is enough; restrain now thine yad. And the Malach Hashem was by the goren of Aravnah the Yevusi."
Shmuel Bais,24,17,"And Dovid spoke unto Hashem when he saw the Malach that struck HaAm, and said, Hineh, I have sinned, and I have transgressed; but these tzon, what have they done? Let Thine yad be against me, and against Bais Avi."
Shmuel Bais,24,18,"And Gad came that day to Dovid, and said unto him, Go up, erect a Mizbe'ach unto Hashem in the goren of Aravnah the Yevusi."
Shmuel Bais,24,19,"And Dovid, according to the Devar Gad, went up as Hashem commanded."
Shmuel Bais,24,20,"And Aravnah looked, and saw HaMelech and his avadim coming on toward him; and Aravnah went out, and prostrated himself before HaMelech on his face upon the ground."
Shmuel Bais,24,21,"And Aravnah said, Why is adoni HaMelech come to his eved? And Dovid said, To buy the goren of thee, to build a Mizbe'ach unto Hashem , that the magefah (plague) may be withdrawn from HaAm."
Shmuel Bais,24,22,"And Aravnah said unto Dovid, Let adoni HaMelech take and offer up what seemeth tov unto him; see, here are oxen for the olah (burnt sacrifice) , and threshing tools and other instruments of the bakar (oxen) for wood."
Shmuel Bais,24,23,"All these things did Aravnah, hamelech lamelech, give. And Aravnah said unto HaMelech, Hashem Eloheicha yirtzecha (accept thee)."
Shmuel Bais,24,24,"And HaMelech said unto Aravnah, Lo (no) ; but I will surely buy it of thee at a mekhir (price) ; neither will I offer olot (burnt offerings) unto Hashem Elohai of that which doth cost me nothing. So Dovid bought the goren and the bakar for fifty shekels of kesef."
Shmuel Bais,24,25,"And Dovid built there a Mizbe'ach unto Hashem , and offered olot (burnt offerings) and shelamim (peace offerings) . So Hashem was entreated for the land, and the magefah (plague) was withdrawn from Yisroel."
