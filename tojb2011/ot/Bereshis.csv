Bereshis,1,1,In the beginning Elohim bara hashomayim (the heavens) and haaretz (the earth).
Bereshis,1,2,"And the earth was tohu vavohu (without form, and void) ; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Ruach Elohim was hovering upon the face of the waters."
Bereshis,1,3,"And Elohim said, Let there be light: and there was light."
Bereshis,1,4,"And Elohim saw the light, that it was tov (good) ; and Elohim divided the ohr (light) from the choshech (darkness)."
Bereshis,1,5,"And Elohim called the light Yom (Day) , and the darkness He called Lailah (Night) . And the erev (evening) and the boker (morning) were Yom Echad (Day One, the First Day)."
Bereshis,1,6,"And Elohim said, Let there be a raki'a (expanse, dome, firmament) in the midst of the mayim (waters) , and let it divide the mayim from the mayim."
Bereshis,1,7,"And Elohim made the raki'a, and divided the waters under the raki'a from the waters which were above the raki'a; and it was so."
Bereshis,1,8,"And Elohim called the raki'a Shomayim (Heaven) . And the erev and the boker were Yom Sheni (Day Two, the Second Day)."
Bereshis,1,9,"And Elohim said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the yabashah (dry land) appear; and it was so."
Bereshis,1,10,And Elohim called the yabashah Eretz (Earth) ; and the mikveh (gathering together of the waters) called He Seas; and Elohim saw that it was tov.
Bereshis,1,11,"And Elohim said, Let the earth bring forth vegetation, the herb yielding zera (seed) , and the fruit tree yielding pri (fruit) after its kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth; and it was so."
Bereshis,1,12,"And the earth brought forth vegetation, and herb yielding zera (seed) after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its kind; and Elohim saw that it was tov (good)."
Bereshis,1,13,"And the erev and the boker were Yom Shlishi (Day Three, the Third Day)."
Bereshis,1,14,"And Elohim said, Let there be lights in the raki'a of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for otot (signs) , and for mo'adim (seasons) , and for yamim (days) , and shanim (years);"
Bereshis,1,15,And let them be for lights in the raki'a of the heaven to give light upon the earth; and it was so.
Bereshis,1,16,"And Elohim made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; He made the kokhavim (stars) also."
Bereshis,1,17,"And Elohim set them in the raki'a of the heaven to give light upon the earth,"
Bereshis,1,18,"And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness; and Elohim saw that it was tov."
Bereshis,1,19,"And the erev and the boker were Yom Revi'i (Day Four, the Fourth Day)."
Bereshis,1,20,"And Elohim said, Let the waters bring forth an abundance of living creatures, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open raki'a of heaven."
Bereshis,1,21,"And Elohim created great sea creatures, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth in abundance, after their kind, and every winged fowl after its kind; and Elohim saw that it was tov."
Bereshis,1,22,"And Elohim blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth."
Bereshis,1,23,"And the erev and the boker were Yom Chamishi (Day Five, the Fifth Day)."
Bereshis,1,24,"And G-d said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after its kind; and it was so."
Bereshis,1,25,"And G-d made the beast of the earth after its kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind; and G-d saw that it was tov."
Bereshis,1,26,"And G-d said, Let Us make man in Our tzelem, after Our demut: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon ha'aretz (the earth)."
Bereshis,1,27,"So G-d created humankind in His own tzelem, in the tzelem Elohim (image of G-d) created He him; zachar (male) and nekevah (female) created He them."
Bereshis,1,28,"And G-d blessed them, and G-d said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."
Bereshis,1,29,"And G-d said, Hinei, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of kol ha'aretz (all the earth) , and every etz (tree) , in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food."
Bereshis,1,30,"And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for food; and it was so."
Bereshis,1,31,"And G-d saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was tov me'od (very good) . And the erev and the boker were Yom Shishi (Day Six, the Sixth Day)."
Bereshis,2,1,"Thus HaShomayim and Ha'Aretz were finished, and all the tza'va of them."
Bereshis,2,2,And on Yom HaShevi'i Elohim finished His work which He had made; and He rested on the Yom HaShevi'i from all His work which He had made.
Bereshis,2,3,"Vayevarech Elohim et Yom HaShevi'i, and set it apart as kodesh: because that in it shavat (He had rested) from all His work which bara Elohim (G-d created) and made."
Bereshis,2,4,"These are the toledot of HaShomayim and of Ha'Aretz when they were created, in the Yom that Hashem Elohim made Eretz v'Shomayim,"
Bereshis,2,5,"And every plant of the sadeh was not yet in ha'aretz, and every herb of the sadeh had not yet yitzmach (sprung up); for Hashem Elohim had not caused it to rain upon ha'aretz, and there was not an adam (man) la'avod (to till, to work) haadamah (the ground)."
Bereshis,2,6,"But there went up a mist from ha'aretz, and watered the whole face of the adamah."
Bereshis,2,7,"And Hashem Elohim formed the adam of the aphar min haadamah, and breathed into his nostrils the nishmat chayyim; and the adam became a nefesh chayyah."
Bereshis,2,8,And Hashem Elohim planted a gan (garden) eastward in Eden; and there He put the adam whom He had formed.
Bereshis,2,9,"And out of the adamah made Hashem Elohim to spring up kol etz (every tree) that is pleasing to the sight, and tov for food; the Etz HaChayyim (Tree of Life) also in the midst of the gan (garden) , and the Etz HaDa'as Tov v'Rah."
Bereshis,2,10,"And a nahar (river) flowed out of Eden to water the gan (garden) ; and from there it divided, and became four headwaters."
Bereshis,2,11,"The shem of the first is Pishon; that is it which winds through the kol eretz Chavilah, where there is zahav;"
Bereshis,2,12,And the zahav of that land is tov; there is [the gemstone] bedolach and the even (gemstone) hashoham.
Bereshis,2,13,And the shem of the second nahar is Gichon; the same is it that winds through kol eretz Kush.
Bereshis,2,14,And the shem of the third nahar is Chiddekel ( Tigris ): that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth nahar is Euphrates.
Bereshis,2,15,"And Hashem Elohim took the adam and put him in the Gan Eden la'avod (to till, to work) it and to be shomer over it."
Bereshis,2,16,"And Hashem Elohim commanded the adam, saying, Of every etz of the gan thou mayest freely eat;"
Bereshis,2,17,"But of the Etz HaDa'as Tov v'Rah, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the yom that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."
Bereshis,2,18,"And Hashem Elohim said, It is not tov that the adam should be alone; I will make him an ezer (a helper) suitable for him."
Bereshis,2,19,"And out of the adamah Hashem Elohim formed every beast of the sadeh, and every oph HaShomayim; and brought them unto the adam to see what he would name them; and whatsoever the adam named kol nefesh chayyah, that was shmo."
Bereshis,2,20,"And the adam gave shemot to all behemah, and to the oph HaShomayim, and to every beast of the sadeh; but for Adam there was not found an ezer for him."
Bereshis,2,21,"And Hashem Elohim caused a tardemah (deep sleep) to fall upon the adam, and he slept; and He took from one of his tzalelot (sides, ribs) , and closed up the basar in the place thereof;"
Bereshis,2,22,"And the tzela (rib) , which Hashem Elohim had taken from the adam, made He an isha, and brought her unto the adam."
Bereshis,2,23,"And the adam said, This is now etzem of my etzem, and basar of my basar; she shall be called Isha, because she was taken out of Ish."
Bereshis,2,24,"Therefore shall an ish leave his av and his em, and shall cleave unto his isha: and they shall be basar echad."
Bereshis,2,25,"And they were both arummim (naked ones) , the adam and his isha, and were not ashamed."
Bereshis,3,1,"Now the Nachash was more arum (cunning, crafty, wiley) than any beast of the sadeh which Hashem Elohim had made. And he said unto the isha, Really? Hath Elohim said, Ye shall not eat of kol etz hagan?"
Bereshis,3,2,"And the isha said unto the Nachash, We may eat of the p'ri etz hagan;"
Bereshis,3,3,"But of the p'ri haEtz which is in the middle of the gan (garden) , Elohim hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."
Bereshis,3,4,"And the Nachash said unto the isha, Ye shall not surely die;"
Bereshis,3,5,"For Elohim doth know that in the yom ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be like Elohim, knowing tov and rah."
Bereshis,3,6,"And when the isha saw that HaEtz was tov for food, and that it was delight to the eyes, and HaEtz to be coveted to make one have seichel, she took of the p'ri thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her ish with her; and he did eat."
Bereshis,3,7,"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were eirummim (naked ones) ; and they sewed aleh te'enah (fig leaves) together, and made themselves khagorot (loin covering girdles)."
Bereshis,3,8,And they heard the kol of Hashem Elohim walking in the gan in the cool of the day; and HaAdam and his isha hid from the presence of Hashem Elohim amongst the etz hagan.
Bereshis,3,9,"And Hashem Elohim called unto HaAdam, and said unto him, Where art thou?"
Bereshis,3,10,"And he said, I heard Thy voice in the gan (garden) , and I was afraid, because I was eirom (naked) ; and so I hid."
Bereshis,3,11,"And He said, Who told thee that thou wast eirom (naked) ? Hast thou eaten of HaEtz, which I commanded thee that thou not eat thereof?"
Bereshis,3,12,"And HaAdam said, The isha whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of HaEtz, and I did eat."
Bereshis,3,13,"And Hashem Elohim said unto the isha, What is this that thou hast done? And the isha said, The Nachash beguiled me, and I did eat."
Bereshis,3,14,"And Hashem Elohim said unto the Nachash, Because thou hast done this, thou art arur (cursed) above kol habehemah, and above every beast of the sadeh; upon thy gakhon (belly) shalt thou go, and aphar shalt thou eat all the days of thy life;"
Bereshis,3,15,"And I will put eivah between thee and HaIsha, and between thy zera and her Zera; He shall crush thy rosh, and thou shalt strike His akev (heel)."
Bereshis,3,16,"Unto HaIsha He said, I will greatly multiply thy itzavon ([labor] pain) and thy childbearing; in pain thou shalt bring forth banim; and thy teshukah (longing, desire) shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."
Bereshis,3,17,"And unto Adam He said, Because thou paid heed unto the voice of thy isha, and hast eaten of HaEtz, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it, arurah (cursed) is haadamah because of thee; in itzavon (pain, suffering) shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;"
Bereshis,3,18,Kotz also and dardar shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the esev of the sadeh;
Bereshis,3,19,"In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat lechem, till thou return unto haadamah; for out of it wast thou taken; for aphar thou art, and unto aphar shalt thou return."
Bereshis,3,20,And HaAdam called the shem of his isha Chavah (Eve) ; because she was the Em kol chai.
Bereshis,3,21,"Unto Adam also and to his isha did Hashem Elohim make kesonos ohr, and clothed them."
Bereshis,3,22,"And Hashem Elohim said, See, HaAdam is become like one of Us, knowing tov v'rah; and now, lest he put forth his yad, and take also of HaEtz HaChayyim, and eat, and chai l'olam (live forever);"
Bereshis,3,23,"Therefore Hashem Elohim sent him forth from the Gan Eden, to work haadamah from which place he was taken."
Bereshis,3,24,"So He drove out HaAdam; and He placed miKedem (at the east) of the Gan Eden HaKeruvim, and a flaming cherev which was ever-turning, to be shomer over the Derech Etz HaChayyim."
Bereshis,4,1,"And HaAdam knew Chavah (Eve) his isha; and she conceived, and bore Kayin (Cain) , and said, Kaniti (I have acquired) ish with Hashem."
Bereshis,4,2,"And again she bore his ach Hevel (Abel) . And Hevel was a ro'eh tzon, but Kayin was an oved adamah (tiller of soil)."
Bereshis,4,3,"And in ketz yamim it came to pass, that Kayin brought of the p'ri haadamah a minchah unto Hashem."
Bereshis,4,4,"And Hevel, he also brought of the bechorot of his tzon and of the chelev thereof. And Hashem regarded [with favor, respect] unto Hevel and to his minchah:"
Bereshis,4,5,"But unto Kayin and to his minchah He had not regard. And Kayin was very angry, and his countenance fell."
Bereshis,4,6,"And Hashem said unto Kayin, Why art thou angry? And why is thy countenance fallen?"
Bereshis,4,7,"If thou doest right, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not right, chattat is lurking at the petach. And unto thee shall be its teshukah (desire) , and thou must rule over it."
Bereshis,4,8,"And Kayin talked with Hevel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the sadeh, that Kayin rose up against Hevel his brother, and killed him."
Bereshis,4,9,"And Hashem said unto Kayin, Where is Hevel thy brother? And he said, I know not; am I shomer achi (my brotherʼs keeper)?"
Bereshis,4,10,"And He said, What hast thou done? The voice of thy brotherʼs dahm crieth unto Me from haadamah."
Bereshis,4,11,"And now art thou arur (cursed) from haadamah, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brotherʼs dahm from thy hand;"
Bereshis,4,12,"When thou tillest haadamah, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her ko'ach (strength) ; na (restless fugitive) vanad (and a wanderer, nomad) shalt thou be in ha'aretz."
Bereshis,4,13,"And Kayin said unto Hashem , My avon (iniquity, punishment for guilt) is greater than I can bear."
Bereshis,4,14,"See, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the adamah; and from Thy face shall I be hidden and I shall be a na (restless fugitive) vanad (and a wanderer, nomad) in ha'aretz; and it shall come to pass, that whoever findeth me shall kill me."
Bereshis,4,15,"And Hashem said unto him, Therefore whoever killeth Kayin, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Hashem placed an ot (mark) upon Kayin, so that none finding him should kill him."
Bereshis,4,16,"And Kayin went out from the presence of Hashem , and dwelt in Eretz Nod, east of Eden."
Bereshis,4,17,"And Kayin knew his isha; and she conceived, and bore Chanokh (Enoch) ; and he built an ir (city) , and called the shem of the ir, after the shem beno, Chanokh (Enoch)."
Bereshis,4,18,And unto Chanokh (Enoch) was born Irad; and Irad fathered Mechuyael; and Mechuyael fathered Metushael; and Metushael fathered Lamech.
Bereshis,4,19,"And Lamech took unto him two nashim; the shem of the one was Adah, and the shem of the second Tzilah."
Bereshis,4,20,"And Adah bore Yaval; he was the av of such as dwell in ohel, and have mikneh."
Bereshis,4,21,And his brotherʼs shem was Yuval; he was the av of all such as play kinnor (harp) and ugav (flute).
Bereshis,4,22,"And Tzilah, she also bore Tuval-Kayin, a forger of every cutting tool of nechoshet and barzel; and the achot of Tuval-Kayin was Na'amah."
Bereshis,4,23,"And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Tzilah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, give heed to my speech; for I have slain an ish for my wounding, and a yeled for my chabburah."
Bereshis,4,24,"If Kayin (Cain) shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and seven times over."
Bereshis,4,25,"And Adam knew his isha again; and she bore a ben, and called shmo Shet; for Elohim, said she, hath appointed me another zera in place of Hevel, whom Kayin killed."
Bereshis,4,26,"And to Shet, to him also there was born a ben; and he called shmo Enosh; then began men to call upon the Shem of Hashem."
Bereshis,5,1,"This is the Sefer Toldot Adam. In the yom that barah Elohim Adam, in the demut Elohim He made him;"
Bereshis,5,2,"Zachar and nekevah He created them; and blessed them, and called the shem of them “Adam,” in the yom when they were created."
Bereshis,5,3,And Adam lived a hundred and thirty shanah and fathered in his own demut and after his tzelem (image) and called shmo Shet:
Bereshis,5,4,And the days of Adam after he had fathered Shet were shemoneh me'ot shanah; and he fathered banim and banot:
Bereshis,5,5,And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty shanah: and he died.
Bereshis,5,6,"And Shet lived a hundred and five shanah, and fathered Enosh;"
Bereshis,5,7,"And Shet lived after he fathered Enosh eight hundred and seven shanah, and fathered banim and banot:"
Bereshis,5,8,And all the days of Shet were nine hundred and twelve shanah; and he died.
Bereshis,5,9,"And Enosh lived ninety shanah, and fathered Kenan;"
Bereshis,5,10,"And Enosh lived after he fathered Kenan eight hundred and fifteen shanah, and fathered banim and banot;"
Bereshis,5,11,And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five shanim; and he died.
Bereshis,5,12,And Kenan lived seventy shanah and fathered Mahalal'el;
Bereshis,5,13,"And Kenan lived after he fathered Mahalal'el eight hundred and forty shanah, and fathered banim and banot;"
Bereshis,5,14,And all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten shanim; and he died.
Bereshis,5,15,"And Mahalal'el lived sixty and five shanah, and fathered Yered;"
Bereshis,5,16,"And Mahalal'el lived after he fathered Yered eight hundred and thirty shanah, and fathered banim and banot;"
Bereshis,5,17,And all the days of Mahalal'el were eight hundred ninety and five shanah; and he died.
Bereshis,5,18,"And Yered lived a hundred sixty and two shanah, and he fathered Chanokh (Enoch):"
Bereshis,5,19,"And Yered lived after he fathered Chanokh (Enoch) eight hundred shanah, and fathered banim and banot;"
Bereshis,5,20,And all the days of Yered were nine hundred sixty and two shanah; and he died.
Bereshis,5,21,"And Chanokh lived sixty and five shanah, and fathered Metushelach;"
Bereshis,5,22,"And Chanokh walked with HaElohim after he fathered Metushelach three hundred shanah, and fathered banim and banot;"
Bereshis,5,23,And all the days of Chanokh were three hundred sixty and five shanah;
Bereshis,5,24,And Chanokh walked with HaElohim; and he was not; for Elohim took him.
Bereshis,5,25,"And Metushelach lived a hundred eighty and seven shanah, and fathered Lamech."
Bereshis,5,26,"And Metushelach lived after he fathered Lamech seven hundred eighty and two shanah, and fathered banim and banot;"
Bereshis,5,27,And all the days of Metushelach were nine hundred sixty and nine shanah; and he died.
Bereshis,5,28,And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two shanah and fathered ben;
Bereshis,5,29,"And he called shmo Noach, saying, Zeh yenachamenu (this shall comfort us) in our work and toil of our hands, because of the adamah which Hashem hath cursed."
Bereshis,5,30,"And Lamech lived after he fathered Noach five hundred ninety and five shanah, and fathered banim and banot;"
Bereshis,5,31,And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven shanah; and he died.
Bereshis,5,32,"And Noach was five hundred years old; and Noach fathered Shem, Cham, and Yephet."
Bereshis,6,1,"And it came to pass, when HaAdam began to multiply on the face of ha'adamah, and banot were born unto them,"
Bereshis,6,2,That the bnei HaElohim saw the banot HaAdam that they were tovot; and they took them nashim of all which they chose.
Bereshis,6,3,"And Hashem said, My Ruach [Hakodesh] shall not always strive with Adam, for that he also is basar: yet his yamim shall be a hundred and twenty shanah."
Bereshis,6,4,"HaNefilim were on ha'aretz in those yamim; and also after that, when the bnei HaElohim came in unto the banot HaAdam, and they bore children to them, the same became gibborim which were of old, men of renown."
Bereshis,6,5,And Hashem saw that the wickedness of HaAdam was great in ha'aretz and that every yetzer (inclination) of the machshevot (thoughts) of his lev was only rah (evil) continually.
Bereshis,6,6,"And Hashem relented that He had made HaAdam on ha'aretz, and He was grieved in His lev."
Bereshis,6,7,"And Hashem said, I will wipe out HaAdam whom I have created from the face of ha'adamah; both Adam, and Behemah, and the Remes and the Oph HaShomayim; for I relent that I have made them."
Bereshis,6,8,"But Noach found chen (grace, unmerited favor) in the eyes of Hashem."
Bereshis,6,9,"These are the toldot of Noach; Noach was an ish tzaddik and tamim among those of his time, and Noachʼs halachah was with HaElohim."
Bereshis,6,10,"And Noach fathered three banim: Shem, Cham, and Yephet."
Bereshis,6,11,"Ha'aretz also was corrupt before HaElohim, and ha'aretz was filled with chamas."
Bereshis,6,12,"And Elohim looked upon ha'aretz, and, hinei, it was corrupt; for kol basar had corrupted his derech upon ha'aretz."
Bereshis,6,13,"And Elohim said unto Noach, The ketz (end) of kol basar is come before Me; for ha'aretz is filled with chamas because of them; and, hineni, I will destroy them with ha'aretz."
Bereshis,6,14,"Make thee a tevah (ark) of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the tevah (ark) , and shalt coat it within and without with tar."
Bereshis,6,15,"And this is how thou shalt build it: the length of the tevah (ark) shall be three hundred cubits, the width of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits."
Bereshis,6,16,"A roof shalt thou make to the tevah (ark) , and thou shalt finish it to a cubit from the top; and the petach of the tevah (ark) shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third decks shalt thou make it."
Bereshis,6,17,"And, hineni, I, even I, do bring a mabbul of waters upon ha'aretz, to destroy kol basar, wherein is the ruach chayyim, from under Shomayim; and everything that is in ha'aretz shall perish."
Bereshis,6,18,"And then with thee will I establish My brit (covenant) ; and thou shalt come into the tevah (ark) , thou, and thy banim, and thy isha, and the nashim of thy banim with thee."
Bereshis,6,19,"And of every living thing of kol basar, two of every kind shalt thou bring into the tevah (ark) , to keep them alive with thee; they shall be zachar and nekevah."
Bereshis,6,20,"Of birds after their kind, and of behemah after their kind, of every remes of ha'adamah after its kind, two of every kind shall come unto thee, to keep them alive."
Bereshis,6,21,"And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for ochel for thee, and for them."
Bereshis,6,22,"Thus did Noach; according to all that Elohim commanded him, so did he."
Bereshis,7,1,"And Hashem said unto Noach, Come thou and all thy bais into the tevah (ark) ; for thee have I found tzaddik before Me in dor hazeh."
Bereshis,7,2,"Of every behemah hatehorah thou shalt take to thee by sevens; the male and his mate; and of behemah that are not tehorah by two, the male and his mate."
Bereshis,7,3,"Of also Oph HaShomayim by sevens, the zachar and the nekevah; to keep zera alive upon the face of kol ha'aretz."
Bereshis,7,4,"For shivah yamim from now, and I will cause it to rain upon ha'aretz arba'im yom and arba'im lailah; and every living creature that I have made will I wipe out from off the p'nei ha'adamah."
Bereshis,7,5,And Noach did according unto all that Hashem commanded him.
Bereshis,7,6,And Noach was shesh me'ot shanah when the mabbul waters were upon ha'aretz.
Bereshis,7,7,"And Noach entered in, and his banim, and his isha, and nashim of his banim with him, into the tevah (ark) , because of the waters of the mabbul."
Bereshis,7,8,"Of behemah hatehorah, and of behemah that are not tehorah, and of haoph, and of every thing that creepeth upon ha'adamah,"
Bereshis,7,9,"There went in shnayim shnayim unto Noach into the tevah (ark) , the zachar and the nekevah, as Elohim had commanded Noach."
Bereshis,7,10,"And it came to pass after shivat hayamim, that the waters of the mabbul were upon ha'aretz."
Bereshis,7,11,"In the six hundredth year of Noachʼs life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the floodgates of Shomayim were opened."
Bereshis,7,12,And the geshem was upon ha'aretz arba'im yom and arba'im lailah.
Bereshis,7,13,"On that very yom entered Noach, and Shem, and Cham, and Yephet, the bnei Noach, and Noachʼs isha, and the three nashim of his banim with them, into the tevah (ark);"
Bereshis,7,14,"They, and every beast after its kind, and kol habehemah after their kind, and every remes that crawls upon ha'aretz after its kind, and kol haoph after its kind, every bird of every sort."
Bereshis,7,15,"And they went in unto Noach into the tevah (ark) , shnayim shnayim of kol habasar, wherein is the ruach chayyim."
Bereshis,7,16,"And they that went in, went in zachar and nekevah of kol basar, as Elohim had commanded him; then Hashem shut him in."
Bereshis,7,17,"And the mabbul was arba'im yom upon ha'aretz; and the waters increased, and lifted up the tevah (ark) , and it rose above ha'aretz."
Bereshis,7,18,"And the waters rose, and were increased greatly upon ha'aretz; and the tevah (ark) floated upon the face of the waters."
Bereshis,7,19,"And the waters rose exceedingly upon ha'aretz; and all the high hills, that were under kol HaShomayim, were covered."
Bereshis,7,20,Fifteen cubits upward did the waters rise; and the harim were covered.
Bereshis,7,21,"And kol basar perished that moved upon ha'aretz, both of Oph, and of Behemah, and of Beast, and of every Swarming Thing that swarms upon ha'aretz, and kol haadam;"
Bereshis,7,22,"All in whose nostrils was the ruach chayyim, of all that was in the dry land, perished."
Bereshis,7,23,"And every living creature was wiped out which was upon the p'nei haadamah, both Adam, and Behemah, and the Remes, and the Oph HaShomayim; and they were wiped out from ha'aretz: and Noach only remained alive, and they that were with him in the tevah (ark)."
Bereshis,7,24,And the waters flooded upon ha'aretz a hundred and fifty days.
Bereshis,8,1,"And Elohim remembered Noach, and every living thing, and all the behemah that was with him in the tevah (ark) ; and Elohim made a ruach to pass over ha'aretz, and the waters subsided;"
Bereshis,8,2,"The ma'ayanot (springs) also of the tehom and the floodgates of Shomayim were stopped, and the geshem from Shomayim was restrained;"
Bereshis,8,3,And the waters receded from on ha'aretz continually; and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
Bereshis,8,4,"And the tevah (ark) rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat."
Bereshis,8,5,"And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the rashei heharim seen."
Bereshis,8,6,"And it came to pass at the end of arba'im yom, that Noach opened the chalon (window) of the tevah (ark) which he had made;"
Bereshis,8,7,"And he sent forth the orev (raven) , which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off ha'aretz."
Bereshis,8,8,"Also he sent forth a yonah (dove) from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the adamah;"
Bereshis,8,9,"But the yonah found no manoach (place of rest) for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the tevah, for the waters were on the p'nei kol ha'aretz; then he reached forth his yad, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the tevah (ark)."
Bereshis,8,10,And he waited yet another shivat yamim; and again he sent forth the yonah out of the tevah (ark);
Bereshis,8,11,"And the yonah returned to him in the erev; and, hinei, in her beak was a zayit (olive) leaf freshly plucked; so Noach had da'as that the mayim were abated from off ha'aretz."
Bereshis,8,12,And he waited yet another shivat yamim; and sent forth the yonah; which returned not unto him again.
Bereshis,8,13,"And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the mayim were dried up from off ha'aretz; and Noach removed the mikhseh (covering) of the tevah (ark) , and looked, and, hinei, the surface of the adamah was dry."
Bereshis,8,14,"And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was ha'aretz dry."
Bereshis,8,15,"And Elohim spoke unto Noach, saying,"
Bereshis,8,16,"Go forth of the tevah (ark) , thou, and thy isha, and thy banim, and the nashim of thy banim with thee."
Bereshis,8,17,"Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of kol basar, both of bird, and of behemah, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon ha'aretz; that they may multiply abundantly on ha'aretz, and be fruitful, and increase upon ha'aretz."
Bereshis,8,18,"And Noach went forth, and his banim, and his isha, and the nashim of his banim with him;"
Bereshis,8,19,"Every animal, every remes, and every bird, and whatsoever creepeth upon ha'aretz, after their kinds, went forth out of the tevah (ark)."
Bereshis,8,20,"And Noach built a Mizbe'ach unto Hashem ; and took of every behemah hatehorah, and of kol haoph hatahor, and offered olot (burnt offerings) on the Mizbe'ach."
Bereshis,8,21,"And Hashem smelled a re'ach hannichoach; and Hashem said in His lev, I will not again curse the adamah any more ba'avur (because of) haAdam; for the yetzer of the lev haAdam is rah from his ne'urim (youth, childhood) ; neither will I again strike any more every thing living, as I have done."
Bereshis,8,22,"While ha'aretz remaineth, zera (seedtime) and katzir (harvest) , and kor (cold) and chom (heat) , and kayitz (summer) and choref (winter) , and yom and lailah shall not cease."
Bereshis,9,1,"Vayevarech Elohim et Noach and his banim, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish ha'aretz."
Bereshis,9,2,"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of ha'aretz, and upon every bird of the air, upon all that moveth upon ha'adamah, and upon all the dagim of the yam; into your yad are they delivered."
Bereshis,9,3,Every remes that liveth shall be food for you; even as the yarok esev (green plant) have I given you all.
Bereshis,9,4,"But basar with the nefesh thereof, which is the dahm thereof, shall ye not eat."
Bereshis,9,5,"And surely your dahm of your nefeshot will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the yad haAdam; at the hand of every manʼs brother will I require the nefesh haAdam."
Bereshis,9,6,"Shofech dahm (one who sheddeth manʼs blood) , by man shall his dahm be shed; for in the tzelem Elohim made He man."
Bereshis,9,7,"And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly on ha'aretz, and multiply therein."
Bereshis,9,8,"And Elohim spoke unto Noach, and to his banim with him, saying,"
Bereshis,9,9,"And I, hineni, I establish My brit (covenant) with you, and with your zera after you;"
Bereshis,9,10,"And with kol nefesh that is with you, of the bird, of the behemah, and of every animal of ha'aretz with you; from kol yotzei hatevah (all that go out of the ark) , to every creature of ha'aretz."
Bereshis,9,11,"And I will establish My brit (covenant) with you, neither shall kol basar yikaret (be cut off, violently killed) any more by the waters of the mabbul; neither shall there be any more mabbul l'shacheit (to destroy) ha'aretz."
Bereshis,9,12,"And Elohim said, This is the ot (sign) of the brit (covenant) which I make between Me and you and every nefesh chayyah (living creature) that is with you, for dorot olam (perpetual generations);"
Bereshis,9,13,"I do set My keshet (bow) in the anan (cloud) , and it shall be for an ot brit between Me and ha'aretz."
Bereshis,9,14,"And it shall come to pass, when I bring an anan over ha'aretz, that the keshet be'anan (rainbow) shall be seen;"
Bereshis,9,15,"And I will remember My brit, which is between Me and you and kol nefesh chayyah of kol basar; and the waters shall no more become a mabbul (flood) l'shacheit (to destroy) kol basar."
Bereshis,9,16,"And the keshet shall be in the anan; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the brit olam between Elohim and kol nefesh chayyah of kol basar that is upon ha'aretz."
Bereshis,9,17,"And Elohim said unto Noach, This is the ot habrit, which I have established between Me and kol basar that is upon ha'aretz."
Bereshis,9,18,"And the bnei Noach, that went forth of the tevah, were Shem, and Cham, and Yephet; and Cham is the av of Kena'an (Canaan)."
Bereshis,9,19,Shloshah (Three) are the bnei Noach; and of them was the kol ha'aretz populated.
Bereshis,9,20,"And Noach began to be an ish ha'adamah (a man of the soil) , and he planted a kerem (vineyard);"
Bereshis,9,21,"And he drank of the yayin, and became shikker (intoxicated) ; and he lay uncovered inside his ohel."
Bereshis,9,22,"And Cham, the av of Kena'an, saw the erom (nakedness) of his av, and told his two achim on the outside."
Bereshis,9,23,"And Shem and Yephet took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and walked backward, and covered the erom of their av; and their faces were turned the other way, and they saw not the erom of their av."
Bereshis,9,24,"And Noach awoke from his yayin, and had da'as of what his ben katan had done unto him."
Bereshis,9,25,"And he said, Arur (cursed) be Kena'an; an eved of avadim shall he be unto his achim."
Bereshis,9,26,"And he said, Baruch Hashem Elohei Shem; and Kena'an shall be his eved."
Bereshis,9,27,"Elohim shall enlarge Yephet, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Kena'an shall be his eved."
Bereshis,9,28,And Noach lived after the mabbul three hundred and fifty years.
Bereshis,9,29,And all the days of Noach were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.
Bereshis,10,1,"Now these are the toldot of the Bnei Noach: Shem, Cham, and Yephet; and unto them were banim born after the mabbul (flood)."
Bereshis,10,2,"The Bnei Yephet: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Yavan, and Tuval, and Meshech, and Tiras."
Bereshis,10,3,"And the Bnei Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphat, and Togarmah."
Bereshis,10,4,"And the Bnei Yavan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim."
Bereshis,10,5,"By these were the coastlands of the Goyim divided in their lands; every one after his leshon, after their mishpechot, in their Goyim."
Bereshis,10,6,"And the Bnei Cham: Cush, and Mitzrayim, and Put, and Kena'an."
Bereshis,10,7,"And the Bnei Cush: Seva, and Chavilah, and Savtah, and Ra'amah, and Savtecha; and the Bnei Raamah: Sheva, and Dedan."
Bereshis,10,8,And Cush fathered Nimrod; he began to be a gibbor in ha'aretz.
Bereshis,10,9,"He was a gibbor, a hunter before Hashem ; therefore it is said, like Nimrod the gibbor, the hunter before Hashem."
Bereshis,10,10,"And the beginning of his kingdom was Bavel, and Erech, and Akkad, and Calneh, in Eretz Shinar."
Bereshis,10,11,"Out of that land he went forth to Ashur, and built Nineveh, and Rechovot-Ir, and Kelach,"
Bereshis,10,12,And Resen between Nineveh and Kelach; the same is haIr Hagedolah.
Bereshis,10,13,"And Mitzrayim fathered Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehavim, and Naphtuchim,"
Bereshis,10,14,"And Patrusim, and Casluchim, out of whom came Pelishtim (Philistines) , and Caphtorim."
Bereshis,10,15,"And Kena'an fathered Tzidon his bechor, and Chet,"
Bereshis,10,16,"And the Yevusi, and the Emori, and the Girgashi,"
Bereshis,10,17,"And the Chivi, and the Arki, and the Sini,"
Bereshis,10,18,"And the Arvadi, and the Tzemari, and the Chamati; and afterward were the mishpechot haKena'ani spread abroad."
Bereshis,10,19,"And the boundary of the Kena'ani was from Tzidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Azah (Gaza) ; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Amora (Gomorrah) , and Admah, and Tzevoyim, even unto Lesha."
Bereshis,10,20,"These are the Bnei Cham, after their mishpechot, after their leshonot, in their territories, and in their Goyim."
Bereshis,10,21,"Also unto Shem avi kol Bnei Ever, and the older brother of Yephet, even to him were offspring born."
Bereshis,10,22,"The Bnei Shem: Eilam, and Ashur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram."
Bereshis,10,23,"And Bnei Aram: Utz, and Chul, and Geter, and Mash."
Bereshis,10,24,And Arpachshad fathered Shelach; and Shelach fathered Ever.
Bereshis,10,25,And unto Ever were born two banim: the shem of one was Peleg; for in his days was ha'aretz divided; and his brotherʼs shem was Yoktan.
Bereshis,10,26,"And Yoktan fathered Almodad, and Sheleph, and Chatzarmavet, and Yerach,"
Bereshis,10,27,"And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,"
Bereshis,10,28,"And Oval, and Avimael, and Sheva,"
Bereshis,10,29,"And Ophir, and Chavilah, and Yovav; all these were the Bnei Yoktan."
Bereshis,10,30,"And their moshav (dwelling) was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar har hakedem."
Bereshis,10,31,"These are the Bnei Shem, after their mishpechot, according to their leshonot, in their territories, after their Goyim."
Bereshis,10,32,"These are the mishpechot of the Bnei Noach, after their toldot, in their Goyim; and by these were the Goyim divided/separated in ha'aretz after the mabbul."
Bereshis,11,1,And the kol HaAretz was of one language and of devarim achadim (common words).
Bereshis,11,2,"And it came to pass, as they migrated from the east, that they found a plain in Eretz Shinar; and they dwelt there."
Bereshis,11,3,"And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and bake them thoroughly. And they had brick for even (stone) , and bitumen had they for mortar."
Bereshis,11,4,"And they said, Come, let us build us an Ir and a Migdal, whose rosh (top) may reach unto Shomayim; and let us make us a shem, otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of kol HaAretz."
Bereshis,11,5,"And Hashem came down to see the Ir and the Migdal, which Bnei HaAdam built."
Bereshis,11,6,"And Hashem said, See, the Am is echad and they have all one language; and this they begin to do; and now nothing will be impossible for them, which they have proposed to do."
Bereshis,11,7,"Come, let Us go down, and there confuse their sefat, that they may not understand one anotherʼs language."
Bereshis,11,8,So Hashem scattered them abroad from there upon the face of kol Ha'Aretz; and they left off building the Ir.
Bereshis,11,9,Therefore is the shem of it called Bavel; because Hashem did there confuse the language of kol Ha'Aretz; and from there did Hashem scatter them abroad upon the face of kol Ha'Aretz.
Bereshis,11,10,"These are the toldot of Shem: Shem was a hundred years old, and fathered Arpachshad two years after the mabbul;"
Bereshis,11,11,"And Shem lived after he fathered Arpachshad five hundred shanah, and fathered banim and banot."
Bereshis,11,12,"And Arpachshad lived five and thirty shanah, and fathered Shelach;"
Bereshis,11,13,"And Arpachshad lived after he fathered Shelach four hundred and three shanim, and fathered banim and banot."
Bereshis,11,14,"And Shelach lived thirty shanah, and fathered Ever;"
Bereshis,11,15,"And Shelach lived after he fathered Ever four hundred and three shanah, and fathered banim and banot."
Bereshis,11,16,"And Ever lived four and thirty shanah, and fathered Peleg;"
Bereshis,11,17,"And Ever lived after he fathered Peleg four hundred and thirty shanah, and fathered banim and banot."
Bereshis,11,18,"And Peleg lived thirty shanah, and fathered Reu;"
Bereshis,11,19,"And Peleg lived after he fathered Reu two hundred and nine shanim, and fathered banim and banot."
Bereshis,11,20,"And Reu lived two and thirty shanah, and fathered Serug;"
Bereshis,11,21,"And Reu lived after he fathered Serug two hundred and seven shanim, and fathered banim and banot."
Bereshis,11,22,"And Serug lived thirty shanah, and fathered Nachor;"
Bereshis,11,23,"And Serug lived after he fathered Nachor two hundred shanah, and fathered banim and banot."
Bereshis,11,24,"And Nachor lived nine and twenty shanah, and fathered Terach;"
Bereshis,11,25,"And Nachor lived after he fathered Terach a hundred and nineteen shanah, and fathered banim and banot."
Bereshis,11,26,"And Terach lived seventy shanah, and fathered Avram, Nachor, and Haran."
Bereshis,11,27,"Now these are the toldot Terach: Terach fathered Avram, Nachor, and Haran; and Haran fathered Lot."
Bereshis,11,28,"And Haran died before his av Terach in the land of his birth, in Ur Kasdim."
Bereshis,11,29,"And Avram and Nachor took them nashim: the shem eshet Avram was Sarai; and the shem eshet Nachor was Milcah, the bat Haran Avi Milcah, and Avi Yiskah."
Bereshis,11,30,But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
Bereshis,11,31,"And Terach took Avram bno, and ben bno Lot ben Haran, and Sarai his kallah, eshet Avram bno; and they went forth with them from Ur Kasdim, to go into Eretz Kena'an; and they came unto Charan (Haran) , and dwelt there."
Bereshis,11,32,And the days of Terach were two hundred and five shanim; and Terach died in Charan (Haran).
Bereshis,12,1,"Now Hashem had said unto Avram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from the bais avicha, unto ha'aretz that I will show thee;"
Bereshis,12,2,"So that I will make of thee a goy gadol (great nation) , so that I will bless thee, and make thy shem great; and so thou shalt be a brocha (blessing);"
Bereshis,12,3,"And I will bless the one blessing you, and curse him that curses you; and kol mishpochot haadamah shall be blessed through you."
Bereshis,12,4,So Avram departed as Hashem had told him; and Lot went with him; and Avram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Charan.
Bereshis,12,5,"And Avram took Sarai his isha, and Lot his brotherʼs son, and all their possessions that they had amassed, and the nefesh that they had gotten in Charan; and they went forth to go into the land of Kena'an; and they arrived in the land of Kena'an."
Bereshis,12,6,"And Avram passed through the land unto the makom Shechem, unto Elon Moreh. And the Kena'ani was then in ha'aretz."
Bereshis,12,7,"And Hashem appeared unto Avram, and said, Unto thy zera will I give ha'aretz hazot: and there built he a Mizbe'ach unto Hashem , Who appeared unto him."
Bereshis,12,8,"And he removed from there unto the harah mikedem Beit-El, and pitched his tent, having Beit-El on the west, and Ai on the east; and there he built a Mizbe'ach unto Hashem , and called upon the Shem of Hashem."
Bereshis,12,9,"And Avram journeyed, going on still toward the Negev."
Bereshis,12,10,And there was a ra'av in the land; and Avram went down into Mitzrayim to sojourn there; for the ra'av was severe in ha'aretz.
Bereshis,12,11,"And it came to pass, when he was about to enter into Mitzrayim, that he said unto Sarai his isha, Hinei now, I know that thou art an isha yafeh to look upon;"
Bereshis,12,12,"Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his isha; and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive."
Bereshis,12,13,"Say, now, thou art my achot; that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my nefesh shall live on account of thee."
Bereshis,12,14,"And it came to pass, that, when Avram was come into Mitzrayim, the Egyptians beheld the isha that she was yafeh me'od."
Bereshis,12,15,"The sarim of Pharaoh also saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh; and the isha was taken into Bais Pharaoh."
Bereshis,12,16,"And he treated Avram well for her sake: and he acquired sheep and oxen, and male donkeys, and avadim, and shfachot, and female donkeys, and camels."
Bereshis,12,17,And Hashem plagued Pharaoh and his Bais with nega'im gedolim because of Sarai eshet Avram.
Bereshis,12,18,"And Pharaoh summoned Avram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy isha?"
Bereshis,12,19,"Why saidst thou, She is my achot? So I might have taken her to me to wife; now therefore, hinei, thy wife, take her, and go!"
Bereshis,12,20,"And Pharaoh commanded his anashim concerning him; and they sent him away, and his isha, and all that he had."
Bereshis,13,1,"And Avram went up out of Mitzrayim, he, and his isha, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negev."
Bereshis,13,2,"And Avram was very rich in cattle, in kesef, and in zahav."
Bereshis,13,3,"And he went on his journeys from the Negev even to Beit-El, unto the makom where his ohel had been at the beginning, between Beit-El and Ai;"
Bereshis,13,4,"Unto the makom of the Mizbe'ach, which he had built there at the first; and there Avram called on the Shem of Hashem."
Bereshis,13,5,"And Lot also, which walked with Avram, had tzon, and herds, and ohalim."
Bereshis,13,6,"And ha'aretz was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together; for their rechush was rav, so that they could not dwell together."
Bereshis,13,7,And there was a riv between the ro'im of the herd of Avram and the ro'im of the herd of Lot; and the Kena'ani and the Perizzi dwelt then in ha'aretz.
Bereshis,13,8,"And Avram said unto Lot, Let there be no merivah now between me and thee, and between my ro'im and thy ro'im; for we are achim."
Bereshis,13,9,"Is not the kol ha'aretz before thee? Separate thyself, now, from me; if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left."
Bereshis,13,10,"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Yarden, that it was well watered everywhere, before Hashem destroyed Sodom and Amora, even as the Gan Hashem , like Eretz Mitzrayim, as you go to Tzoar."
Bereshis,13,11,Then Lot chose for him all the plain of Yarden; and Lot journeyed mikedem (east) ; and they separated themselves the one from his brother.
Bereshis,13,12,"Avram dwelled in Eretz Kena'an, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his ohel toward Sodom."
Bereshis,13,13,But the men of Sodom were ra'im and chatta'im before Hashem exceedingly.
Bereshis,13,14,"And Hashem said unto Avram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the makom where thou art northward, and southward and eastward, and westward:"
Bereshis,13,15,"For kol ha'aretz which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy zera ad olam (forever)."
Bereshis,13,16,"And I will make thy zera as the dust of ha'aretz; so that if a man can number the aphar of ha'aretz, then shall thy zera also be numbered."
Bereshis,13,17,"Arise, walk through ha'aretz in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee."
Bereshis,13,18,"Then Avram moved his ohel, and came and dwelt in Elonei Mamre, which is in Chevron, and built there a Mizbe'ach unto Hashem."
Bereshis,14,1,"And it came to pass in the yamim of Amraphel Melech Shinar, Aryoch Melech Ellasar, Kedorlaomer Melech Eilam, and Tidal Melech Goyim;"
Bereshis,14,2,"That these made milchamah with Bera Melech Sodom, and with Birsha Melech Amora (Gomorrah) , Shinav Melech Admah, and Shemever Melech Tzevoyim, and the Melech Bela, which is Tzoar."
Bereshis,14,3,All these were joined together in the Valley of Siddim which is the Yam HaMelach.
Bereshis,14,4,"Twelve shanah they served Kedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled."
Bereshis,14,5,"And in the fourteenth year came Kedorlaomer, and the melachim that were with him, and they defeated the Repha'im in Ashterot Karnayim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-Kiryatayim,"
Bereshis,14,6,"And the Chori in their Mt Se'ir, as far as Eil-Paran, which is near the midbar."
Bereshis,14,7,"And they turned, and came to En Mishpat, which is Kadesh, and conquered all the country of the Amaleki, and also the Emori, that dwelt in Chatzetzon-Tamar."
Bereshis,14,8,"And there went out the Melech Sodom, and the Melech Amora (Gomorrah) , and the Melech Admah, and the Melech Tzevoyim, and the Melech Bela; and they joined in milchamah with them in the Valley of Siddim;"
Bereshis,14,9,"With Kedorlaomer Melech Eilam, and with Tidal Melech Goyim, and Amraphel Melech Shinar, and Aryoch Melech Ellasar; four melachim against five."
Bereshis,14,10,"And the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the Melech Sodom and Amora (Gomorrah) they fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain."
Bereshis,14,11,"And they took all the possessions of Sodom and Amora (Gomorrah) , and all their ochel, and went their way."
Bereshis,14,12,"And they took Lot, Avramʼs brotherʼs son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his possessions, and departed."
Bereshis,14,13,"And there came one that had escaped, and told Avram HaIvri; for he dwelt in Elonei Mamre the Emori, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were Ba'alei Brit Avram."
Bereshis,14,14,"And when Avram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained men, born in his own bais, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them as far as Dan."
Bereshis,14,15,"And he divided himself against them, he and his avadim, by lailah, and routed them, and pursued them as far as Chovah, which is on the left hand (north) of Damascus."
Bereshis,14,16,"And he recovered all the possessions, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his possessions, and the nashim also, and the people."
Bereshis,14,17,"And the Melech Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the defeat of Kedorlaomer, and of the melachim that were with him, at the Valley of Shaveh, which is the Valley of the King."
Bereshis,14,18,And Malki-Tzedek Melech Shalem brought forth lechem and yayin and he was the kohen of El Elyon.
Bereshis,14,19,"And he blessed him, and said, Baruch Avram by El Elyon, Possessor of Shomayim va'Aretz;"
Bereshis,14,20,"And baruch El Elyon, Who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him ma'aser (tithe) of all."
Bereshis,14,21,"And the Melech Sodom said unto Avram, Give me the nefesh and keep the possessions for thyself."
Bereshis,14,22,"And Avram said to the Melech Sodom, I have lifted up mine hand unto Hashem , El Elyon Possessor of Shomayim va'Aretz,"
Bereshis,14,23,"That I will not take from a thread even to the thong of a sandal, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Avram rich;"
Bereshis,14,24,"Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the chelek of the anashim which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their chelek."
Bereshis,15,1,"After these things the Devar Hashem came unto Avram in a makhazeh, saying, Fear not, Avram; I am thy mogen, and thy exceeding great sachar (reward)."
Bereshis,15,2,"And Avram said, Adonoi Hashem , what wilt Thou give me, since I go childless, and the Ben Meshek of my Bais is this Eli'ezer of Damesek (Damascus)?"
Bereshis,15,3,"And Avram said, See, to me Thou hast given no zera; and, hinei, one born in my bais is my yoresh (heir)."
Bereshis,15,4,"And, hinei, the Devar Hashem came unto him saying, This shall not be thy yoresh; but he that shall come forth out of thine own body shall be thy yoresh."
Bereshis,15,5,"And He brought him forth outside, and said, Look now toward Shomayim, and count the kokhavim, if thou be able to number them; and He said unto him, So shall thy zera be."
Bereshis,15,6,And he believed in Hashem ; and He credited [emunah (faith) ] to him as tzedakah (righteousness).
Bereshis,15,7,"And He said unto him, I am Hashem Who brought thee out of Ur Kasdim, to give thee ha'aretz hazot to be the yoresh of it."
Bereshis,15,8,"And he said, Adonoi Hashem , how can I have da'as that I will be its yoresh?"
Bereshis,15,9,"And He said unto him, Bring Me a heifer meshuleshet, and a she goat meshuleshet, and a ram meshulash, and a dove, and a pigeon."
Bereshis,15,10,"And he brought unto Him all these, and divided them in two, and laid each half one opposite another; but the birds divided he not."
Bereshis,15,11,"And when the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, Avram drove them away."
Bereshis,15,12,"And when the shemesh was going down, a tardemah fell upon Avram; and, hinei, a horror of great darkness fell upon him."
Bereshis,15,13,"And Hashem said unto Avram, Know of a surety that thy zera shall be a ger in a land not their own, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them arba me'ot shanah;"
Bereshis,15,14,"And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge; and afterward shall they come out with rechush gadol (great substance)."
Bereshis,15,15,And thou shalt go to thy avot in shalom; thou shalt be buried at a good old age.
Bereshis,15,16,But in the fourth generation they shall come back here again; for the avon (iniquity) of the Emori (Amorite) is not yet full.
Bereshis,15,17,"And it came to pass, that, when the shemesh went down, and it was dark, hinei a smoking fire-pot, and a blazing torch passed between those pieces."
Bereshis,15,18,"On that day Hashem cut a brit (covenant) with Avram, saying, Unto thy zera have I given ha'aretz hazot, from the Wadi of Mitzrayim unto the great river, the river Euphrates:"
Bereshis,15,19,"[the land of] the Keni, and the Kenizzi, and the Kadmoni,"
Bereshis,15,20,"And the Chitti, and the Perizzi, and the Repha'im,"
Bereshis,15,21,"And the Emori, and the Kena'ani, and the Girgashi, and the Yevusi."
Bereshis,16,1,"Now Sarai Avramʼs isha bore him no children; and she had a shifchah, an Egyptian, whose shem was Hagar."
Bereshis,16,2,"And Sarai said unto Avram, Hinei now, Hashem hath restrained me from bearing; go now in unto my shifchah; it may be that I may build family by her. And Avram paid heed to the voice of Sarai."
Bereshis,16,3,"And Sarai Avramʼs isha took Hagar her shifchah the Egyptian, after Avram had dwelt ten years in Eretz Kena'an, and gave her to her husband Avram to be his isha."
Bereshis,16,4,"And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her gevirah was despised in her eyes."
Bereshis,16,5,"And Sarai said unto Avram, My wrong be upon thee; I have given my shifchah unto thy kheyk; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes; Hashem judge between me and thee."
Bereshis,16,6,"But Avram said unto Sarai, Hinei, thy shifchah is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt harshly with her, she fled from her face."
Bereshis,16,7,"And the Malach Hashem found her by a spring of mayim in the midbar, near the spring on the road to Shur."
Bereshis,16,8,"And he said, Hagar, Saraiʼs shifchah, from where camest thou? And where wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my gevirah Sarai."
Bereshis,16,9,"And the Malach Hashem said unto her, Return to thy gevirah, and submit thyself under her hands."
Bereshis,16,10,"And the Malach Hashem said unto her, I will multiply thy zera exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude."
Bereshis,16,11,"And the Malach Hashem said unto her, See, thou art with child and shalt bear ben, and shalt call shmo Yishmael; because Hashem shema thy oni (misery)."
Bereshis,16,12,"And he will be a pere adam; his yad will be against kol, and kol yad against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren."
Bereshis,16,13,"And she called the Shem of Hashem Who spoke unto her, El Roi (G-d Who Sees) ; for she said, Have I also here seen after Him that seeth me?"
Bereshis,16,14,"Therefore the well was called Be'er Lachai Roi; hinei, it is between Kadesh and Bered."
Bereshis,16,15,"And Hagar bore Avram ben; and Avram called shem bno, which Hagar bore, Yishmael (Ishmael)."
Bereshis,16,16,And Avram was fourscore and six shanah when Hagar bore Yishmael to Avram.
Bereshis,17,1,"And when Avram was ninety and nine shanah, Hashem appeared to Avram, and said unto him, I am El Shaddai; walk before Me, and be thou tamim (blameless)."
Bereshis,17,2,"And I will confirm My brit (covenant) between Me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly."
Bereshis,17,3,"And Avram fell on his face; and Elohim talked with him, saying,"
Bereshis,17,4,"As for Me, hinei, My brit (covenant) is with thee, and thou shalt be an Av of many Goyim."
Bereshis,17,5,"Neither shall thy shem any more be called Avram, but thy shem shall be Avraham; for Av hamon Goyim (Father of a multitude of Goyim) have I made thee."
Bereshis,17,6,"And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make Goyim of thee, and Melechim shall come out of thee."
Bereshis,17,7,"And I will establish My Brit (covenant) between Me and thee and thy zera after thee in their dorot for a Brit Olam, to be Elohim unto thee, and to thy zera after thee."
Bereshis,17,8,"And I will give unto thee, and to thy zera after thee, the Eretz wherein thou art now a ger, kol Eretz Kena'an, for an Achuzzah (Possession) Olam (Everlasting) ; and I will be their Elohim."
Bereshis,17,9,"And Elohim said unto Avraham, Thou shalt be shomer over My Brit therefore, thou, and thy zera after thee in the dorot."
Bereshis,17,10,"This is My Brit (covenant) , which ye shall be shomer over, between Me and you and thy zera after thee; every zachar among you shall be circumcised."
Bereshis,17,11,And ye shall circumcise the basar of your arelah; and it shall be an ot brit (sign of the covenant) between Me and you.
Bereshis,17,12,"And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every zachar in your dorot, he that is born in the bais, or bought with kesef of any foreigner, which is not of thy zera."
Bereshis,17,13,"He that is born in thy bais, and he that is bought with thy kesef, must be circumcised; and My Brit shall be in your basar for a Brit Olam."
Bereshis,17,14,"And the arel (uncircumcised) zachar whose basar of his arelah (foreskin) is not circumcised, that nefesh shall be cut off from his people; My Brit hefer (he broke)."
Bereshis,17,15,"And Elohim said unto Avraham, As for Sarai thy isha, thou shalt not call her shem Sarai, but Sarah (Princess) shall her shem be."
Bereshis,17,16,"And I will bless her, and give thee ben also of her; yes, will bless her, and she shall give rise to Goyim; melechim of peoples shall be from her."
Bereshis,17,17,"Then Avraham fell upon his face, and yitzchak (laughed) , and said in his lev, Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred shanah? And shall Sarah, that is ninety shanah, bear?"
Bereshis,17,18,"And Avraham said unto HaElohim, O that Yishmael might live before Thee!"
Bereshis,17,19,"And Elohim said, Sarah thy isha shall bear thee ben indeed; and thou shalt call shmo Yitzchak; and I will establish My Brit (covenant) with him for a Brit Olam, and with his zera after him."
Bereshis,17,20,"And as for Yishmael, I have heard thee; hinei, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve nasi'im (princes, rulers) shall he father, and I will make him a goy gadol (great nation)."
Bereshis,17,21,"But My Brit (covenant) will I establish with Yitzchak, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at mo'ed hazeh (this set time) next year."
Bereshis,17,22,"And He left off speaking with him, and Elohim went up from Avraham."
Bereshis,17,23,"And Avraham took Yishmael bno, and all that were born in his bais, and all that were bought with his kesef, every zachar among the men of Avrahamʼs bais; and circumcised the basar of their arelah in the very same day, as Elohim had said unto him."
Bereshis,17,24,"And Avraham was ninety shanah and nine, when he was circumcised in the basar of his arelah."
Bereshis,17,25,"And Yishmael bno was thirteen shanah, when he was circumcised in the basar of his arelah (foreskin)."
Bereshis,17,26,"In the very same day was Avraham circumcised, and Yishmael bno."
Bereshis,17,27,"And all the men of his bais, born in the bais, and bought with kesef of the foreigner, were circumcised with him."
Bereshis,18,1,And Hashem appeared unto him in the terebinth trees of Mamre; and he sat in the entrance of the ohel (tent) in the heat of the day;
Bereshis,18,2,"And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, hinei, Shloshah Anashim (Three Men) stood by him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the entrance of the ohel, and prostrated himself on the ground,"
Bereshis,18,3,"And said, Adonoi, if now I have found chen (favor) in Thy sight, pass not on by, please, from Thy servant;"
Bereshis,18,4,"Let a little water, please, be brought, and wash Thy feet, and rest under haetz (the tree);"
Bereshis,18,5,"And I will bring a morsel of bread, and refresh Ye Your hearts; after that Ye shall pass on; because for this purpose are Ye come to Your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said."
Bereshis,18,6,"And Avraham hastened into the ohel unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly shlosh measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes."
Bereshis,18,7,"And Avraham ran unto the herd, and brought a calf tender and tov, and gave it unto a servant; and he hasted to prepare it."
Bereshis,18,8,"And he took curds, and cholov (milk) , and the calf which he had prepared, and set it before them; and he stood by them under haetz, and they did eat."
Bereshis,18,9,"And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Hinei, in the ohel."
Bereshis,18,10,"And He said, I will certainly return unto thee at this time next year; and, hinei, Sarah thy wife shall have ben (son) . And Sarah heard it in the entrance of the ohel, which was behind him."
Bereshis,18,11,Now Avraham and Sarah were zekenim (old ones) and well stricken in age; and [in childbearing] it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
Bereshis,18,12,"Therefore Sarah laughed [titzchak, sounds like Yitzchak] within herself, saying, After I am grown old shall I have pleasure, adoni being old also?"
Bereshis,18,13,"And Hashem said unto Avraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I which am old of a surety bear a child?"
Bereshis,18,14,"Is any thing too hard for Hashem ? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, in due season, and Sarah shall have ben (son)."
Bereshis,18,15,"Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And He said, Oh yes but thou didst laugh."
Bereshis,18,16,"And the Anashim rose up from thence, and peered toward Sodom; and Avraham went with them to send them on the way."
Bereshis,18,17,"And Hashem said, Shall I hide from Avraham that thing which I do;"
Bereshis,18,18,"Seeing that Avraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and kol goyei ha'aretz (all the nations of the earth) shall be blessed in him?"
Bereshis,18,19,"For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall be shomer over the Derech Hashem , to do tzedakah and mishpat; that Hashem may bring upon Avraham that which He hath spoken [promised] of him."
Bereshis,18,20,"And Hashem said, Because the outcry of Sodom and Amora is great, and because their sin is very grievous;"
Bereshis,18,21,"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the crying out [for punishment] of it, which is come unto Me; and if not, I will have da'as."
Bereshis,18,22,"And the Men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom; but Avraham stood yet before Hashem."
Bereshis,18,23,"And Avraham drew near, and said, Wilt Thou also destroy the tzaddik with the rasha?"
Bereshis,18,24,Suppose there be fifty tzaddikim within the city; wilt Thou also destroy and not nasa (spare) the place lema'an (for the sake of) the fifty tzaddikim that are therein?
Bereshis,18,25,"That be far from Thee to do after this manner, to slay the tzaddik with the rasha; and that the tzaddik should be as the rasha, that be far from Thee: Shall not HaShofet Kol Ha'Aretz (the Judge of All the Earth) do mishpat (right)?"
Bereshis,18,26,"And Hashem said, If I find in Sodom fifty tzaddikim within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes."
Bereshis,18,27,"And Avraham answered and said, Hinei now, I, which am but aphar and ashes, have taken upon me to speak unto Hashem;"
Bereshis,18,28,"Suppose there shall lack five of the fifty tzaddikim; wilt Thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And He said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it."
Bereshis,18,29,"And he spoke unto Him yet again, and said, Suppose there shall be forty found there. And He said, I will not do it for fortyʼs sake."
Bereshis,18,30,"And he said unto Him, Oh let not Hashem be angry, and I will speak; suppose there shall thirty be found there. And He said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
Bereshis,18,31,"And he said, Hinei now, I have taken upon me to speak unto Hashem : suppose there shall be twenty found there. And He said, I will not destroy it for twentyʼs sake."
Bereshis,18,32,"And he said, Oh let not Hashem be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: suppose asarah (ten, i.e., a minyan) shall be found there. And He said, I will not destroy it for the sake of haasarah (the ten)."
Bereshis,18,33,"And Hashem went His way, as soon as He had left communing with Avraham; and Avraham returned unto his makom."
Bereshis,19,1,And there came two malachim to Sodom at erev; and Lot sat in the sha'ar Sodom; and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
Bereshis,19,2,"And he said, Hinei, adonai (my masters) , turn in, now, into the bais avdechem, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Lo; but we will abide the night in the rekhov."
Bereshis,19,3,"And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his bais; and he made them a mishteh (meal, feast) , and did bake matzot, and they did eat."
Bereshis,19,4,"But before they lay down, the men of the Ir, even the anshei Sodom, surrounded the bais, from na'ar to zeken, all the people from every quarter [of the city];"
Bereshis,19,5,"And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the anashim which came in to thee halailah (this night) ? Bring them out unto us, that we may know them [carnally]."
Bereshis,19,6,"And Lot went outside unto them, and shut the delet after him,"
Bereshis,19,7,"And said, Now, achai (my brethren) , do not so wickedly."
Bereshis,19,8,"Hinei now, I have two banot which have not known man; now let me bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes; only unto these anashim do nothing; for therefore came they under the tzel (shadow) of my korah (beam, roof)."
Bereshis,19,9,"And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn as a ger (alien) , and he will now play the shofet; now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed strongly upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break down the delet."
Bereshis,19,10,"But the anashim put forth their yad, and pulled Lot into the bais to them, and shut the delet."
Bereshis,19,11,"And they struck the men that were at the petach of the bais with blindness, both katan and gadol; so that they wearied themselves to find the petach."
Bereshis,19,12,"And the anashim said unto Lot, Hast thou here any one else? Choson (Son-in-law) , and thy banim, and thy banot, and whatsoever thou hast in the Ir, bring them out of this makom (place);"
Bereshis,19,13,"For we are the mashchitim (ones destroying) this makom (place) , because the cry of them is so gedolah before the face of Hashem ; and Hashem hath sent us to destroy it."
Bereshis,19,14,"And Lot went out, and spoke unto his chosonim, which were pledged to marry his banot, and said, Up, get you out of makom hazeh; for Hashem is mashchit (destroying) the Ir (City) . But he seemed as one that metzachek (joked) unto his chosonim."
Bereshis,19,15,"And when the shachar came, then the malachim urged Lot, saying, Arise, take thy isha, and thy two banot, which are here or thou be swept away in the avon haIr."
Bereshis,19,16,"And while he lingered hesitating, the anashim laid hold upon his yad, and upon the yad of his isha, and upon the yad of his two banot; Hashem being merciful unto him; and they brought him out and set him outside the Ir."
Bereshis,19,17,"And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth outside, that he said, Flee and escape for thy nefesh; look not back behind thee, neither stop thou anywhere in all the plain; flee and escape to the mountain, lest thou be swept away."
Bereshis,19,18,"And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, Adonoi (My L-rd):"
Bereshis,19,19,"Hinei now, thy eved hath found chen in Thy sight, and Thou hast magnified Thy chesed, which Thou hast showed unto me in sparing my nefesh; and I cannot flee to escape to the mountain, lest some ra'ah overtake me, and I die;"
Bereshis,19,20,"Hinei now, this Ir is near to run unto, and it is a little one; Oh, let me flee to escape there, (is it not mitzar [small]?), and my nefesh shall live."
Bereshis,19,21,"And He said unto him, Hinei, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the Ir, for the which thou hast spoken."
Bereshis,19,22,"Haste thee, flee to escape there; for I cannot do anything till thou arrive there. Therefore the shem of the Ir was called Tzoar."
Bereshis,19,23,The shemesh rose over ha'aretz when Lot entered Tzoar.
Bereshis,19,24,Then Hashem rained upon Sodom and upon Amora gofrit and eish from Hashem out of Shomayim;
Bereshis,19,25,"And He overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and tzemach (what grew) upon haadamah."
Bereshis,19,26,"But his isha, from behind him, looked back, and she became a netziv melach (pillar of salt)."
Bereshis,19,27,And Avraham got up early in the boker to the makom where he stood there before Hashem;
Bereshis,19,28,"And he looked down toward Sodom and Amora, and toward all the eretz of the plain, and hinei, he saw kitor (smoke, steam) of the eretz go up like kitor of a furnace."
Bereshis,19,29,"And it came to pass, when Elohim destroyed the cities of the plain, that zikron Avraham came to Elohim, and He sent Lot out of the midst of the hafekhah (upheaval, destruction, overthrow) , when He overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt."
Bereshis,19,30,"And Lot left Tzoar, and dwelt in the har, and his two banot with him; for he feared to dwell in Tzoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two banot."
Bereshis,19,31,"And the bechirah said unto the younger, Avinu is old, and there is not an ish in ha'aretz to come in unto us after the derech of kol ha'aretz:"
Bereshis,19,32,"Come, let us make avinu drink yayin, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve zera by avinu."
Bereshis,19,33,"And they made their av drink yayin balailah: and the bechirah went in, and lay with her av; and he had da'as not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
Bereshis,19,34,"And it came to pass on the next day, that the bechirah said unto the younger, Hinei, I lay yesternight with avi. Let us make him drink yayin halailah also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve zera by avinu."
Bereshis,19,35,"And they made their av drink yayin balailah also; and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he had da'as not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
Bereshis,19,36,Thus were both the banot of Lot with child by their av.
Bereshis,19,37,"And the bechirah bore ben, and called shmo Moav; the same is the Avi Moav unto this day."
Bereshis,19,38,"And the younger, she also bore ben, and called shmo Ben-Ammi; the same is the Avi Bnei Ammon unto this day."
Bereshis,20,1,"And Avraham journeyed from there toward the Negev region, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar."
Bereshis,20,2,"And Avraham said of Sarah his isha, She is my achot; and Avimelech Melech Gerar sent, and took Sarah."
Bereshis,20,3,"But Elohim came to Avimelech in a chalom halailah, and said to him, See, thou art met (dead) , for the isha which thou hast taken; for she is be'ulat ba'al (married of a husband)."
Bereshis,20,4,"But Avimelech had not come near her; and he said, Adonoi, wilt Thou slay also a goy tzaddik?"
Bereshis,20,5,"Said he not unto me, She is my achot? and she, even she herself said, He is achi: in the tohm (integrity, guilelessness) of my lev and with clean hands of my innocency have I done this."
Bereshis,20,6,"And HaElohim said unto him in a chalom, Yea, I have da'as that thou didst this in the tohm (integrity, guilelessness) of thy lev; for I also withheld thee from sinning against Me; therefore allowed I thee not to touch her."
Bereshis,20,7,"Now therefore restore the ish his isha; for he is a navi, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live; and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine."
Bereshis,20,8,"Therefore Avimelech rose early in the boker, and called all his avadim, and told all these things in their ears; and the anashim were very afraid."
Bereshis,20,9,"Then Avimelech called Avraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and how have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my mamlechah (kingdom) a chata'ah gedolah (great sin) ? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done."
Bereshis,20,10,"And Avimelech said unto Avraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?"
Bereshis,20,11,"And Avraham said, Because I thought, Surely the yirat Elohim is not in this place; and they will slay me on account of my isha."
Bereshis,20,12,"And yet indeed she is my achot; she is the bat avi, but not the bat immi; and she became my isha."
Bereshis,20,13,"And it came to pass, when Elohim caused me to wander from my bais avi, that I said unto her, This is thy chesed which thou shalt show unto me; at every place where we shall come, say of me, He is achi."
Bereshis,20,14,"And Avimelech took tzon, and oxen, and avadim, and shfachot, and gave them unto Avraham, and restored to him Sarah his isha."
Bereshis,20,15,"And Avimelech said, Hinei, my land is before thee; dwell where it pleaseth thee."
Bereshis,20,16,"And unto Sarah he said, Hinei, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of kesef; hinei, it is to thee a kesut einayim (covering of the eyes, exoneration) , unto all that are with thee, and with all other; thus she was vindicated."
Bereshis,20,17,"So Avraham davened unto Elohim: and Elohim healed Avimelech, and his isha, and his maidservants so that they bore children."
Bereshis,20,18,"For Hashem had fast closed up kol rechem (every womb) of the bais Avimelech, on account of Sarah Avrahamʼs isha."
Bereshis,21,1,"And Hashem visited Sarah as He had said, and Hashem did unto Sarah just as He had spoken."
Bereshis,21,2,"For Sarah conceived, and bore Avraham ben in his old age, at the mo'ed (set time) of which Elohim had given promise unto him."
Bereshis,21,3,"And Avraham called the shem of bno that was born unto him, whom Sarah bore to him, Yitzchak."
Bereshis,21,4,"And Avraham circumcised bno Yitzchak at age shemonat yamim, as Elohim had commanded him."
Bereshis,21,5,"And Avraham was a hundred years old, when bno Yitzchak was born unto him."
Bereshis,21,6,"And she said, Elohim hath brought me tzechok (laughter) , so that all that hear yitzchak (will laugh) with me."
Bereshis,21,7,"And she said, Who would have said unto Avraham, that Sarah should nurse banim? for I have borne him ben in his old age."
Bereshis,21,8,"And the yeled grew, and was weaned; and Avraham made a mishteh gadol the same day that Yitzchak was weaned."
Bereshis,21,9,"And Sarah saw the ben of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne unto Avraham, metzachek (mocking, scoffing)."
Bereshis,21,10,"Therefore she said unto Avraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her ben: for the ben of this bondwoman shall not be heir with beni (my son) , even with Yitzchak."
Bereshis,21,11,And the thing was very grievous in the eyes of Avraham because of bno.
Bereshis,21,12,"And Elohim said unto Avraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the na'ar, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, shema (pay heed) unto her voice; for in Yitzchak shall thy zera be called."
Bereshis,21,13,"And also of the ben haamah will I make a nation, because he is thy zera."
Bereshis,21,14,"And Avraham rose up early in the boker, and took lechem, and a skin of mayim, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the yeled, and sent her away; and she departed, and wandered in the midbar of Be'er-Sheva."
Bereshis,21,15,"And the mayim in the skin was done, and she cast the yeled under one of the bushes."
Bereshis,21,16,"And she went off, and sat down about a bowshot away: for she thought, Let me not see the mot hayeled. And she sat there nearby, and lifted up her voice, and wept."
Bereshis,21,17,"And Elohim heard the voice of the na'ar; and the Malach Elohim called to Hagar out of Shomayim, and said unto her, Mah lach, Hagar? fear not; for Elohim hath heard the voice of the na'ar where he is."
Bereshis,21,18,"Arise, lift up the na'ar, and hold him in thine yad; for I will make him a goy gadol."
Bereshis,21,19,"And Elohim opened her eyes, and she saw a be'er of mayim; and she went, and filled the skin with mayim, and gave the na'ar drink."
Bereshis,21,20,"And Elohim was with the na'ar; and he grew, and dwelt in the midbar, and became a roveh keshet (an archer)."
Bereshis,21,21,And he dwelt in the midbar of Paran: and his em got him an isha out of Eretz Mitzrayim.
Bereshis,21,22,"And it came to pass at that time, that Avimelech and Phichol the sar tz'va of his spoke unto Avraham, saying, Elohim is with thee in all that thou doest:"
Bereshis,21,23,"Now therefore swear unto me here before Elohim that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my child, nor with my descendant: but according to the chesed that I have showed thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the eretz wherein thou hast sojourned."
Bereshis,21,24,"And Avraham said, I will swear."
Bereshis,21,25,"And Avraham reproved Avimelech because of a be'er hamayim, which Avimelechʼs avadim had violently seized."
Bereshis,21,26,"And Avimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but today."
Bereshis,21,27,"And Avraham took tzon and oxen, and gave them unto Avimelech; and both of them made a brit."
Bereshis,21,28,And Avraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the tzon by themselves.
Bereshis,21,29,"And Avimelech said unto Avraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set apart by themselves?"
Bereshis,21,30,"And he said, For these sheva ewe lambs shalt thou accept of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have dug this well."
Bereshis,21,31,Therefore he called that place Be'er-Sheva; because there they swore an oath both of them.
Bereshis,21,32,"Thus they made a brit at Be'er-Sheva: then Avimelech rose up, and Phichol the sar tzeva of his, and they returned into eretz Pelishtim."
Bereshis,21,33,"And Avraham planted an eshel (tamarisk tree) in Be'er-Sheva, and called there on the Shem of Hashem El Olam."
Bereshis,21,34,And Avraham sojourned in eretz Pelishtim yamim rabbim.
Bereshis,22,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that G-d did test Avraham, and said unto him, Avraham: and he said, Hineini (Behold, here I am)."
Bereshis,22,2,"And He said, Take now thy son, thine ben yachid (only son) Yitzchak, whom thou lovest, and get thee into eretz Moriyah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of."
Bereshis,22,3,"And Avraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his servants with him, and Yitzchak his son, and cut the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which G-d had told him."
Bereshis,22,4,"Then on Yom HaShlishi Avraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off."
Bereshis,22,5,"And Avraham said unto his servants, Abide ye here with the donkey; and I and the young man will go over there and nishtachaveh (we will worship) and we will come back again to you."
Bereshis,22,6,"And Avraham took atzei haolah (the wood of the burnt offering) , and laid it upon Yitzchak his son; and he took the eish (fire) in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together."
Bereshis,22,7,"And Yitzchak spoke unto Avraham his father, and said, Avi (My father) : and he said, Hineini, beni (Here am I, my son) . And he said, Hinei, the eish (fire) and the wood: but where is the seh (lamb) for a burnt offering?"
Bereshis,22,8,"And Avraham said, My son, G-d will provide Himself a seh (lamb) for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together."
Bereshis,22,9,"And they came to the place which G-d had told him of; and Avraham built a mizbe'ach there, and laid the wood in order, and made the akedah (binding) of Yitzchak his son, and laid him on the mizbe'ach upon the wood."
Bereshis,22,10,"And Avraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son."
Bereshis,22,11,"And the Malach Hashem called unto him out of Shomayim, and said, Avraham, Avraham: and he said, Hineini."
Bereshis,22,12,"And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the young man, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest G-d, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine ben yachid from Me."
Bereshis,22,13,"And Avraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and hinei behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Avraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering TAKHAT (instead of) his son."
Bereshis,22,14,"And Avraham called the name of that place Hashem Yireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of Hashem it shall be provided."
Bereshis,22,15,"And the Malach Hashem called unto Avraham out of Shomayim the second time,"
Bereshis,22,16,"And said, By Myself have I sworn, saith Hashem , for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine ben yachid:"
Bereshis,22,17,"That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy zera as the stars of the skies, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy zera shall possess the gate of his enemies;"
Bereshis,22,18,And in thy zera shall kol goyei ha'aretz be blessed; because thou hast obeyed My voice.
Bereshis,22,19,"So Avraham returned unto his servants, and they rose up and went together to Be'er-Sheva; and Avraham dwelt at Be'er-Sheva."
Bereshis,22,20,"And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Avraham, saying, Hinei, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nachor;"
Bereshis,22,21,"Utz his bechor (firstborn) , and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,"
Bereshis,22,22,"And Kesed, and Chazo, and Pildash, and Yidlaph, and Betuel."
Bereshis,22,23,"And Betuel fathered Rivkah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nachor, Avrahamʼs brother."
Bereshis,22,24,"And his pilegesh, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tevach, and Gacham, and Tachash, and Maachah."
Bereshis,23,1,And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty shanah old: these were the shnei chayyai Sarah.
Bereshis,23,2,"And Sarah died in Kiryat-Arba; the same is Chevron in eretz Kena'an: and Avraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her."
Bereshis,23,3,"And Avraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke unto the bnei Chet, saying,"
Bereshis,23,4,"I am a ger and a sojourner with you: give me an achuzzah (possession) of a kever with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
Bereshis,23,5,"And the bnei Chet answered Avraham, saying unto him,"
Bereshis,23,6,"Hear us, adoni: thou art a nasi Elohim among us; in the choice of kevareinu bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his kever, that thou mayest bury thy dead."
Bereshis,23,7,"And Avraham stood up, and bowed himself to the am ha'aretz, even to the bnei Chet."
Bereshis,23,8,"And he spoke to them, saying, If it be your nefesh (will) that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intercede for me to Ephron ben Tzochar,"
Bereshis,23,9,"That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his sadeh; for the kesef maleh (full price) he shall give it me for an achuzzah (possession) of a kever amongst you."
Bereshis,23,10,"And Ephron dwelt among the bnei Chet: and Ephron the Chitti answered Avraham in the hearing of the bnei Chet, even of all that went in at the sha'ar of his city, saying,"
Bereshis,23,11,"Lo, adoni, hear me; the sadeh give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the bnei ammi give I it thee; bury thy dead."
Bereshis,23,12,And Avraham bowed down himself before the am ha'aretz.
Bereshis,23,13,"And he spoke unto Ephron in the hearing of the am ha'aretz, saying, But if thou wilt give it, now, hear me; I will give thee kesef for the sadeh; accept it from me, and I will bury my dead there."
Bereshis,23,14,"And Ephron answered Avraham, saying unto him,"
Bereshis,23,15,"Pay heed, adoni, unto me; the land is worth four hundred shekels of kesef; what is that between me and thee? bury therefore thy dead."
Bereshis,23,16,"And Avraham paid heed unto Ephron; and Avraham weighed to Ephron the kesef, which he had named in the hearing of the bnei Chet four hundred shekels of kesef, according to current merchant value."
Bereshis,23,17,"And the sadeh of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was near Mamre, the sadeh, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the sadeh, that were in all the borders round about, were deeded"
Bereshis,23,18,"Unto Avraham for a property in the presence of the bnei Chet, before all that went in at the sha'ar of his city."
Bereshis,23,19,"And after this, Avraham buried Sarah his isha in the cave of the sadeh of Machpelah near Mamre; the same is Chevron in the eretz Kena'an."
Bereshis,23,20,"And the sadeh, and the cave that is therein, were deeded unto Avraham for an achuzzah of a kever by the bnei Chet."
Bereshis,24,1,"And Avraham was zaken (old) , and well stricken in age; and Hashem berach (had blessed) Avraham in all things."
Bereshis,24,2,"And Avraham said unto his eved zekan of his bais, hamoshel (that ruled) over all that he had, Put, now, thy yad under my thigh;"
Bereshis,24,3,"And I will make thee swear by Hashem Elohei HaShomayim and Elohei Ha'Aretz, that thou shalt not take an isha unto beni of the Banot HaKena'ani, among whom I dwell:"
Bereshis,24,4,"But thou shalt go unto my eretz, and to my moledet, and take an isha unto beni Yitzchak."
Bereshis,24,5,"And the eved said unto him, What if the isha will not be willing to follow me unto HaAretz Hazot: must I needs bring binecha back unto ha'aretz from where thou camest?"
Bereshis,24,6,"And Avraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not beni to there!"
Bereshis,24,7," Hashem Elohei HaShomayim, which took me from bais avi, and from the eretz of my moledet, and which spoke unto me, and that swore unto me, saying, Unto thy zera will I give HaAretz Hazot; He shall send His Malach before thee, and thou shalt take an isha unto beni from there."
Bereshis,24,8,"But if the isha will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be released from this my shevu'ah (oath) : only do not bring back beni there."
Bereshis,24,9,"And the eved put his yad under yerech Avraham adonav, and swore to him concerning this matter."
Bereshis,24,10,"And the eved took asarah gemalim of the gemalei adonav, and departed; for all the goods of adonav were in his yad: and he arose, and went to Aram Naharayim (Mesopotamia) , unto the Ir Nachor."
Bereshis,24,11,"And he made his gemalim to kneel down outside the Ir near a be'er hamayim at the time of erev, at the time that women go out to draw mayim."
Bereshis,24,12,"And he said Hashem Elohei adoni Avraham, now, send me success this yom, and show chesed unto adoni Avraham."
Bereshis,24,13,"Hinei, I stand here by the ayin hamayim; and the banot anshei haIr come out to draw mayim;"
Bereshis,24,14,"And let it come to pass, that the na'arah to whom I shall say, Let down thy jug, now, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy gemalim drink also; let the same be she that Thou hast appointed for Thy eved Yitzchak; and thereby shall I know that Thou hast showed chesed unto adoni."
Bereshis,24,15,"And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, hinei, Rivkah came out, who was born to Betuel Ben Milcah, eshet Nachor, achi Avraham, with her jug upon her shoulder."
Bereshis,24,16,"And the na'arah was tovat mareh me'od, a betulah, neither had any ish known her: and she went down to haayenah (the spring) , and filled her jug, and came up."
Bereshis,24,17,"And the eved hurried to meet her, and said, Let me, now, drink a little mayim of thy jug."
Bereshis,24,18,"And she said, Drink, adoni: and she hasted, and let down her jug upon her yad, and gave him drink."
Bereshis,24,19,"And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy gemalim also, until they have done drinking."
Bereshis,24,20,"And she hasted, and emptied her jug into the trough, and ran back unto the be'er to draw, and drew for all his gemalim."
Bereshis,24,21,"And the ish gazed at her and held his peace, so as to have da'as whether Hashem had made his derech prosperous or not."
Bereshis,24,22,"And it came to pass, just as the gemalim had done drinking, that the ish took a nezem zahav (gold ring) by weight a beka, and two tzemidim (bracelets) by weight ten [shekels of] gold for her wrists;"
Bereshis,24,23,"And said, Whose bat art thou? Tell me, now: is there makom in the bais of thy av for us to spend the night?"
Bereshis,24,24,"And she said unto him, I am Bat Betuel Ben Milcah, the ben which she bore unto Nachor."
Bereshis,24,25,"She said moreover unto him, We have both teven (straw) and mispo (fodder) enough, and makom (room) to spend the night."
Bereshis,24,26,"And the ish bowed his head, worshiped Hashem."
Bereshis,24,27,"And he said, Baruch Hashem Elohei adoni Avraham, who hath not left destitute of His chesed and His emes; I being on the derech, Hashem led me to the bais achei adoni."
Bereshis,24,28,"And the na'arah ran, and told them of her bais em these things."
Bereshis,24,29,"And Rivkah had an ach, shmo Lavan; Lavan ran out unto the ish, unto the ayin."
Bereshis,24,30,"And it came to pass, when he saw the nezem and tzemidim upon the wrists of his achot, and when he heard the words of Rivkah his achot, saying, Thus spoke the ish unto me; that he came unto the ish; and, hinei, he stood by the gemalim at the ayin."
Bereshis,24,31,"And he said, Come in, Baruch Hashem ; why standest thou outside? for I have prepared the bais, and makom for the gemalim."
Bereshis,24,32,"And the ish came into the bais; and he unloaded his gemalim, and gave teven (straw) and mispo (fodder) for the camels, and mayim to wash his raglayim, and the raglei haanashim that were with him."
Bereshis,24,33,"And there was set ochel before him to eat; but he said, I will not eat, until I have stated my business. And he said, Speak on."
Bereshis,24,34,"And he said, I am eved Avraham."
Bereshis,24,35,"And Hashem hath blessed adoni me'od; and he is become prospered: and He hath given him tzon, and bakar, and kesef, and zahav, and avadim, and shefachot, and gemalim, and chamorim."
Bereshis,24,36,And Sarah eshet adoni bore ben to adoni when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.
Bereshis,24,37,"And adoni made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take an isha for beni of the Banot HaKena'ani, in whose land I dwell;"
Bereshis,24,38,"But thou shalt go unto bais avi, to my mishpokhot, and take an isha unto beni."
Bereshis,24,39,"And I said unto adoni, What if the isha will not follow me."
Bereshis,24,40,"And he said unto me, Hashem , before Whom I walk, will send His Malach with thee, and prosper thy derech; and thou shalt take an isha for beni of my mishpokhot, and of my bais avi;"
Bereshis,24,41,"Then shalt thou be released from this my oath, when thou comest to my mishpokhot; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be released from my oath."
Bereshis,24,42,"And I came this day unto the ayin, and said, Hashem Elohei adoni Avraham, if now Thou do prosper my derech which I go;"
Bereshis,24,43,"Hinei, I stand by the ayin hamayim; and it shall come to pass, that when haAlmah cometh forth to draw mayim, and I say to her, Give me, now, a little mayim of thy jar to drink;"
Bereshis,24,44,"And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy gemalim; let the same be the isha whom Hashem hath appointed for ben adoni."
Bereshis,24,45,"And before I had done davening in mine lev, hinei, Rivkah came forth with her jar on her shoulder; and she went down unto ha'ayenah, and drew: and I said unto her, Let me drink, now."
Bereshis,24,46,"And she made haste, and let down her jar from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy gemalim drink also: so I drank, and she made the gemalim drink also."
Bereshis,24,47,"And I asked her, and said, Whose bat art thou? And she said, Bat Betuel Ben Nachor, the ben whom Milcah bore unto him: and I put the nezem upon her face, and the tzemidim upon her wrists."
Bereshis,24,48,"And I bowed down my head, and worshiped Hashem , and I said a brocha to Hashem Elohei adoni Avraham, which had led me on the derech emes to take bat achi adoni for bno."
Bereshis,24,49,"And now if ye will do chesed and emes to adoni, tell me; and if not, tell me; that I may turn to yamin, or to smol."
Bereshis,24,50,"Then Lavan and Betuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from Hashem ; we cannot speak unto thee rah or tov."
Bereshis,24,51,"Hinei, Rivkah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be isha for ben adoneicha, just as Hashem hath spoken."
Bereshis,24,52,"And it came to pass, that, when eved Avraham heard their words, he worshiped Hashem , bowing himself to the ground."
Bereshis,24,53,"And the eved brought forth kelei kesef, and kelei zahav, and begadim, and gave them to Rivkah; he gave also to her ach and to her em migdanot (costly gifts)."
Bereshis,24,54,"And they did eat and drink, he and the anashim that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the boker, and he said, Send me away unto adoni."
Bereshis,24,55,"And her ach and her em said, Let the na'arah abide with us ten days or so; after that she shall go."
Bereshis,24,56,"And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing Hashem hath prospered my derech; send me away that I may go to adoni."
Bereshis,24,57,"And they said, We will call the na'arah, and inquire at her mouth."
Bereshis,24,58,"And they called Rivkah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this ish? And she said, I will go."
Bereshis,24,59,"And they sent away Rivkah their achot, and her nurse, and eved Avraham, and his anashim."
Bereshis,24,60,"And they said a brocha over Rivkah, and said unto her, Thou art achoteinu, may thou be increased to thousands upon thousands and may thy zera possess the sha'ar of those which hate them."
Bereshis,24,61,"And Rivkah arose, and her na'arot, and they rode upon the gemalim, and followed the ish: and the eved took Rivkah, and went his way."
Bereshis,24,62,And Yitzchak had come from Be'er Lachai Roi; for he dwelt in the eretz hanegev.
Bereshis,24,63,"And Yitzchak went out to meditate in the sadeh at erev: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, hinei, the gemalim (camels) were coming."
Bereshis,24,64,"And Rivkah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Yitzchak, she got down from the gamal."
Bereshis,24,65,"For she had said unto the eved, Who is that ish that walketh in the sadeh to meet us? And the eved had said, He is adoni: therefore she took a veil, and covered herself."
Bereshis,24,66,And the eved told Yitzchak all things that he had done.
Bereshis,24,67,"And Yitzchak brought her into the ohel of Sarah immo, and took Rivkah, and she became his isha; and he loved her: and Yitzchak was comforted after the [mot] immo."
Bereshis,25,1,"Then again Avraham took an isha, and her shem was Keturah."
Bereshis,25,2,"And she bore him Zimran, and Yokshan, and Medan, and Midyan, and Yishbak, and Shuach."
Bereshis,25,3,"And Yokshan fathered Sheva, and Dedan. And the bnei Dedan were Ashurim, and Letushim, and Leummim."
Bereshis,25,4,"And the bnei Midyan; Ephah, and Epher, and Chanokh, and Avida, and Eldaah. All these were the bnei Keturah."
Bereshis,25,5,And Avraham gave all that he had unto Yitzchak.
Bereshis,25,6,"But unto the bnei hapilageshim (sons of the concubines) , which Avraham had, Avraham gave mattanot, and sent them away from Yitzchak bno, while he yet lived, eastward, unto eretz kedem."
Bereshis,25,7,"And these are the days of the years of Avrahamʼs life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen shanim."
Bereshis,25,8,"Then Avraham breathed his last, and died in a good old age, a zaken, full of years; and was gathered to his people."
Bereshis,25,9,"And his banim Yitzchak and Yishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the sadeh of Ephron ben Tzochar the Chitti, which is near Mamre;"
Bereshis,25,10,"The sadeh which Avraham purchased of the bnei Chet, there was Avraham buried, and Sarah his wife."
Bereshis,25,11,"And it came to pass after the mot Avraham, that Elohim blessed Yitzchak bno; and Yitzchak dwelt near Be'er Lachai Roi."
Bereshis,25,12,"Now these are the toldot Yishmael ben Avraham, whom Hagar the Egyptian, shifchat Sarah, bore unto Avraham:"
Bereshis,25,13,"And these are the shemot bnei Yishmael, by their shemot, according to their toldot: the bechor of Yishmael, Nevayot; and Kedar, and Adbe'el, and Mivsam,"
Bereshis,25,14,"And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,"
Bereshis,25,15,"Chadad, and Tema, Yetur, Naphish, and Kedmah:"
Bereshis,25,16,"These are the bnei Yishmael, and these are their shemot, by their settlement, and by their camps; twelve nasiim (princes, rulers) according to their tribes."
Bereshis,25,17,"And these are the years of the life of Yishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven shanah; and he breathed his last and died; and was gathered unto his people."
Bereshis,25,18,"And they dwelt from Chavilah unto Shur, that is near Mitzrayim, as thou goest toward Assyria; they took their place east of their brethren."
Bereshis,25,19,And these are the toldot of Yitzchak ben Avraham: Avraham fathered Yitzchak;
Bereshis,25,20,"And Yitzchak was arba'im shanah when he took Rivkah as his wife, the bat Betuel HaArami of Paddan-Aram, the achot Lavan HaArami."
Bereshis,25,21,"And Yitzchak davened to Hashem on behalf of his isha, because she was barren; and Hashem was entreated of him, and Rivkah his isha conceived."
Bereshis,25,22,"And the banim struggled jostling within her; and she said, If it be well, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of Hashem."
Bereshis,25,23,"And Hashem said unto her, Two goyim (nations) are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be separated from within thee; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the older shall serve the younger."
Bereshis,25,24,"And when her days were fulfilled to be delivered, hinei, there were twins in her womb."
Bereshis,25,25,And the first came out admoni (red) all over like a hairy garment; and they called shmo Esav.
Bereshis,25,26,"And after that came out his brother, and his yad was grasping on akev Esav; and shmo was called Ya'akov; and Yitzchak was threescore shanah when she bore them."
Bereshis,25,27,"And the nearim grew: and Esav was a skilled hunter, an ish sadeh; and Ya'akov was an ish tam (quiet man) , dwelling in ohalim."
Bereshis,25,28,"And Yitzchak loved Esav, because he did eat of his wild game; but Rivkah loved Ya'akov."
Bereshis,25,29,"And Ya'akov cooked stew: and Esav came from the sadeh, and he was famished."
Bereshis,25,30,"And Esav said to Ya'akov, Let me eat now some of the adom (red stew) ; for I am famished; therefore was shmo called Edom."
Bereshis,25,31,"And Ya'akov said, First sell me today thy bechorah (birthright, right of the firstborn)."
Bereshis,25,32,"And Esav said, Hinei, I am at the point of death; and what profit shall this bechorah do to me?"
Bereshis,25,33,"And Ya'akov said, Swear to me this day; and he swore unto him; and he sold his bechorah unto Ya'akov."
Bereshis,25,34,"Then Ya'akov gave Esav lechem and adashim (lentils) stew; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way; thus Esav despised his bechorah."
Bereshis,26,1,"And there was a ra'av (famine) in ha'aretz, besides the ra'av harishon that was in the days of Avraham. And Yitzchak went unto Avimelech Melech Pelishtim (Philistines) unto Gerar."
Bereshis,26,2,"And Hashem appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Mitzrayim; dwell in ha'aretz which I shall tell thee of;"
Bereshis,26,3,"Sojourn in ha'aretz hazot, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy zera, I will give all these lands, and I will perform the shevu'ah (oath) which I swore unto Avraham avichah;"
Bereshis,26,4,"And I will make thy zera to multiply as the kokhavim of Shomayim, and will give unto thy zera all these lands; and in thy zera shall kol Goyei Ha'Aretz be blessed;"
Bereshis,26,5,"Because Avraham obeyed My voice, and was shomer over My mishmeret (charge) , My mitzvot, My chukkot, and My torot."
Bereshis,26,6,And Yitzchak dwelt in Gerar;
Bereshis,26,7,"And the anshei hamakom asked him about his isha; and he said, She is my achot; for he feared to say, She is my isha; lest, said he, the anshei hamakom should kill me for Rivkah; because she was beautiful to look upon."
Bereshis,26,8,"And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Avimelech Melech Pelishtim (Philistines) looked out at a chalon, and saw, and, hinei, Yitzchak metzachek (was caressing) Rivkah his isha."
Bereshis,26,9,"And Avimelech called Yitzchak, and said, Hinei, of a surety she is thy isha; and why saidst thou, She is my achot? And Yitzchak said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her."
Bereshis,26,10,"And Avimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have slept with thy isha, and thou shouldest have brought asham (guilt) upon us."
Bereshis,26,11,"And Avimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his isha shall surely be put to death."
Bereshis,26,12,"Then Yitzchak sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year a hundredfold; and Hashem blessed him."
Bereshis,26,13,"And the man became very prosperous, and went forward, and grew until he became gadol me'od:"
Bereshis,26,14,"For he had possession of tzon, and possession of herds, and many avadim; and the Pelishtim envied him."
Bereshis,26,15,"For all the wells which avdei aviv had dug in the days of Avraham aviv, the Pelishtim had stopped them up, and filled them with dirt."
Bereshis,26,16,"And Avimelech said unto Yitzchak, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we."
Bereshis,26,17,"And Yitzchak departed from there, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there."
Bereshis,26,18,"And Yitzchak dug again the be'erot hamayim (wells of water) , which they had dug in the days of Avraham aviv; for the Pelishtim had stopped them up after the mot Avraham; and he called their shemot after the shemot by which his av had called them."
Bereshis,26,19,"And avdei Yitzchak dug in the valley, and found there a well of mayim chayyim."
Bereshis,26,20,"And the herdmen of Gerar did quarrel with Yitzchakʼs herdmen, saying, The mayim is ours; and he called the shem of the well Esek (Contention) ; because they disputed with him."
Bereshis,26,21,"And they dug another be'er, and feuded over that also; and he called the shem of it Sitnah (Enmity)."
Bereshis,26,22,"And he moved away from there, and dug another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the shem of it Rechovot (Broad Places) ; and he said, For now Hashem hath made rachav (room) for us, and we shall be fruitful in ha'aretz."
Bereshis,26,23,And he went up from there to Be'er-Sheva.
Bereshis,26,24,"And Hashem appeared unto him balailah hahu, and said, I am Elohei Avraham avichah; fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy zera for the sake of Avdi Avraham (My Servant Abraham)."
Bereshis,26,25,"And he built a Mizbe'ach there, and called upon the Shem of Hashem , and pitched his ohel there: and there avdei Yitzchak dug a well."
Bereshis,26,26,"Then Avimelech went to him from Gerar, and Achuzzat his adviser, and Phichol the sar tz'va of his."
Bereshis,26,27,"And Yitzchak said unto them, Why come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
Bereshis,26,28,"And they said, We saw certainly that Hashem was with thee; and we said, Let there be now an oath between us, even between us and thee, and let us cut a brit (covenant) with thee;"
Bereshis,26,29,"That thou wilt do us no ra'ah, just as we have not touched thee, and just as we have done unto thee nothing but tov, and have sent thee away in shalom; thou art now the Beruch Hashem (the blessed of Hashem)."
Bereshis,26,30,"And he made them a mishteh (feast) , and they did eat and drink."
Bereshis,26,31,"And they rose up early in the boker, and swore one to another: and Yitzchak sent them away, and they departed from him in shalom."
Bereshis,26,32,"And it came to pass the same day, that the avdei Yitzchak came, and told him concerning the be'er which they had dug, and said unto him, We have found mayim."
Bereshis,26,33,"And he called it Shevah (Seven, Oath) : therefore the shem of the Ir is Be'er-Sheva unto this day."
Bereshis,26,34,"And Esav was arba'im shanah when he took to wife Yehudit the bat Be'eri the Chitti, and Basmat the bat Elon the Chitti:"
Bereshis,26,35,and they were a morat ruach (grief of mind) unto Yitzchak and Rivkah.
Bereshis,27,1,"And it came to pass, that when Yitzchak was zaken (old) ,and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esav bno hagadol and said unto him, Beni: and he said unto him, Hineni."
Bereshis,27,2,"And he said, Hinei now, I am old, I know not my yom mot:"
Bereshis,27,3,"Therefore take, now, thy kelim (weapons) , thy quiver and thy keshet (bow) , and go out to the sadeh, and hunt me some wild game;"
Bereshis,27,4,"And make me matamim (savory meat, tasty food) , such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my nefesh may make a brocha upon thee before I die."
Bereshis,27,5,"And Rivkah heard when Yitzchak spoke to Esav bno. And Esav went to the sadeh to hunt for wild game, and to bring it."
Bereshis,27,6,"And Rivkah spoke unto Ya'akov her ben, saying, Hinei, I heard avicha speak unto Esav achicha, saying,"
Bereshis,27,7,"Bring me wild game, and make me matamim, that I may eat, and make a brocha upon thee before Hashem before my mot."
Bereshis,27,8,"Now therefore, beni (my son) , obey my kol (voice) according to that which I command thee."
Bereshis,27,9,"Go now to the tzon, and bring me from there two gedayei izzim tovim (good kids of goats) ; and I will make them matamim for avicha, such as he loveth:"
Bereshis,27,10,"And thou shalt bring it to avicha, that he may eat, and that he may make a brocha upon thee before his mot."
Bereshis,27,11,"And Ya'akov said to Rivkah immo, Look, Esav achi is an ish sa'ir (hairy man) , and I am an ish chalak (smooth man)."
Bereshis,27,12,"What if avi will touch me, and I shall seem to him as a meta'te'a (mocker) ; and I shall bring a kelalah upon me, and not a brocha."
Bereshis,27,13,"And immo said unto him, Upon me be thy kelalah, beni; only obey my kol (voice) , and go bring me them."
Bereshis,27,14,"And he went, and got, and brought them to immo: and immo made matamim, such as aviv loved."
Bereshis,27,15,"And Rivkah took begadim of Esav her ben hagadol, the chamudot (best ones) which were with her in the bais, and dressed Ya'akov her ben hakatan;"
Bereshis,27,16,"And with orot gedayei haizzim (skins of the kids of the goats) she dressed and covered his hands, and also upon the smooth of his tzavar (neck);"
Bereshis,27,17,"And she gave the matamim and the lechem, which she had prepared, into the yad Ya'akov her ben."
Bereshis,27,18,"And he came unto aviv, and said, Avi; and he said, Hineni; who art thou, beni?"
Bereshis,27,19,"And Ya'akov said unto aviv, I am Esav thy bechor; I have done according as thou told me; arise, now, sit up and eat of my wild game, that thy nefesh may make a brocha upon me."
Bereshis,27,20,"And Yitzchak said unto bno, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, beni? And he said, Hashem Eloheicha worked it out for me."
Bereshis,27,21,"And Yitzchak said unto Ya'akov, Come near, now, that I may touch thee, beni, indeed, whether thou be beni Esav or not."
Bereshis,27,22,"And Ya'akov went near unto Yitzchak aviv; and he touched him, and said, The kol is kol Ya'akov, but the yadayim are the yedei Esav."
Bereshis,27,23,"And he discerned him not, for his hands were se'irot, as yedei Esav achiv; so he made a brocha upon him."
Bereshis,27,24,"And he said, Art thou indeed beni Esav? And he said, I am."
Bereshis,27,25,"And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of the wild game of beni, that my nefesh may make a brocha upon thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat; and he brought him yayin and he drank."
Bereshis,27,26,"And aviv Yitzchak said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me beni."
Bereshis,27,27,"And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the reiach (smell) of his begadim, and made a brocha upon him, and said, See, the reiach of beni is as the reiach of a sadeh upon which Hashem hath made a brocha;"
Bereshis,27,28,"Therefore HaElohim give thee of the tal haShomayim, and the fatness of ha'aretz, and plenty of dagan and tirosh;"
Bereshis,27,29,"Let people serve thee, and amim bow down to thee: be gevir over thy achim, and let bnei immecha bow down to thee: arur be every one that curseth thee, and baruch be he that blesseth thee."
Bereshis,27,30,"And as soon as Yitzchak had completed making on Ya'akov a brocha, and Ya'akov had hardly gone out from the presence of Yitzchak aviv, that Esav achiv came in from his hunt."
Bereshis,27,31,"And he also had prepared matamim, and brought it unto aviv and said unto aviv, Let avi arise, and eat of the wild game of bno, that thy nefesh may make a brocha upon me."
Bereshis,27,32,"And Yitzchak aviv said unto him, Mi atah? (Who art thou?) And he said, I am binecha, thy bechor Esav."
Bereshis,27,33,"And Yitzchak trembled with charadah gedolah ad me'od (exceedingly great trembling) , and said, Who? Where is he that hath hunted wild game, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all of it before thou camest, and have made a brocha upon him? And indeed he shall be baruch (blessed)!"
Bereshis,27,34,"And when Esav heard the words of aviv, he cried with tzeakah gedolah umarah ad me'od (a great and exceeding bitter cry) , and said unto aviv, Make a brocha on me, even me also, O avi."
Bereshis,27,35,"And he said, Achicha came with mirmah (deceit) , and hath taken away thy brocha."
Bereshis,27,36,"And he said, Is not he rightly called shmo Ya'akov? for vaya'keveni (now he deceived/outwitted me) these two times he took away my bechorah (birthright) ; and, hinei, now he hath taken away my brocha (blessing) . And he asked, Hast thou not reserved a brocha for me?"
Bereshis,27,37,"And Yitzchak answered and said unto Esav, See, I have made him gevir over you, and all his achim have I given to him for avadim; and with dagan and tirosh have I sustained him; and what shall I do now unto thee, beni?"
Bereshis,27,38,"And Esav said unto aviv, Hast thou but one brocha, avi? Make a brocha on me, even me also, O avi. And Esav lifted up his kol (voice) , and wept."
Bereshis,27,39,"And Yitzchak aviv answered and said unto him, Hinei, thy moshav (dwelling) shall be the fatness of ha'aretz, and of the tal HaShomayim from above;"
Bereshis,27,40,"And by thy cherev shalt thou live, and shalt serve achicha; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt become restless, that thou shalt break his ol (yoke) from off thy tzavar (neck)."
Bereshis,27,41,"And Esav hated Ya'akov because of the brocha wherewith aviv made a brocha upon him: and Esav said in his lev, The yemei evel (days of mourning) for avi are at hand; then will I slay Ya'akov achi."
Bereshis,27,42,"And these words of Esav her ben hagadol were told to Rivkah; and she sent and called Ya'akov her ben hakatan, and said unto him, Hinei, Esav achicha, as touching thee, doth console himself, purposing to kill thee."
Bereshis,27,43,"Now therefore, beni, shema bekoli (listen to my voice) ! Arise, flee thou to Lavan achi to Charan;"
Bereshis,27,44,"And tarry with him a few days, until chamat achicha subsides;"
Bereshis,27,45,"And when af achicha subsides from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him; then I will send, and get thee from there. Why should I be bereaved also of you both in yom echad (one day, the same day)?"
Bereshis,27,46,"And Rivkah said to Yitzchak, I am weary of my life because of the Banot Chet: if Ya'akov take an isha of the Banot Chet (Hittite women) such as these which are of the banot ha'aretz, what will chayyim to me be?"
Bereshis,28,1,"And Yitzchak called for Ya'akov, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take an isha of the Banot Kena'an."
Bereshis,28,2,"Arise, go to Paddanah-Aram, to the bais Betuel avi immecha; and take thee an isha from there of the banot Lavan achi immecha."
Bereshis,28,3,"And El Shaddai bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a kahal amim;"
Bereshis,28,4,"And give thee the birkat Avraham, to thee, and to thy zera with thee; that thou mayest inherit the eretz wherein thou art a ger, which Elohim gave unto Avraham."
Bereshis,28,5,"And Yitzchak sent away Ya'akov; and he went to Paddanah-Aram unto Lavan ben Betuel HaArami, achi Rivkah, em Ya'akov and Esav."
Bereshis,28,6,"When Esav saw that Yitzchak had blessed Ya'akov, and sent him away to Paddanah-Aram, to take an isha for him from there; and that when he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take an isha of the Banot Kena'an;"
Bereshis,28,7,"And that Ya'akov obeyed his av and his em, and went to Paddanah-Aram;"
Bereshis,28,8,And Esav seeing that the Banot Kena'an pleased not Yitzchak his av;
Bereshis,28,9,"Then went Esav unto Yishmael, and took unto the nashim which he had Machalat bat Yishmael ben Avraham, the achot of Nevayot, to be his wife."
Bereshis,28,10,"And Ya'akov went out from Be'er-Sheva, and went toward Charan."
Bereshis,28,11,"And he reached a certain place, and tarried there, because the shemesh was set; and he took of the avanim of that place, and put them for his pillow, and lay down in that place to sleep."
Bereshis,28,12,"And he had a chalom, and hinei a sullam (ladder, stairway) set up on the ground, and the top of it reached to Shomayim: and hinei the malachim of Elohim ascending and descending on it."
Bereshis,28,13,"And, hinei, Hashem stood above it, and said, I am Hashem Elohei Avraham thy av, and Elohei Yitzchak; ha'aretz whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy zera;"
Bereshis,28,14,"And thy zera shall be as the dust of ha'aretz, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south; and in thee and in thy zera shall kol hamishpochot haadamah be blessed."
Bereshis,28,15,"And, hinei, I am with thee, and will be shomer over thee in all places where thou goest, and will bring thee back into haadamah hazot; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have promised thee."
Bereshis,28,16,"And Ya'akov awoke out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Hashem is in this place! And I had no da'as of it."
Bereshis,28,17,"And he was afraid, and said, How nora (awesome) is this place! This is none other than the Beis Elohim, and this is the Sha'ar HaShomayim."
Bereshis,28,18,"And Ya'akov rose up early in the boker, and took haeven (the stone) that he had put for his pillow, and set it up for a matzevah (pillar) , and poured shemen upon the top of it."
Bereshis,28,19,And he called the shem of that place Beit-El; but the shem of that ir was called Luz at the first.
Bereshis,28,20,"And Ya'akov vowed a neder (vow) , saying, If Elohim will be with me, and will be shomer over me in this derech (way, journey) that I go, and will give me lechem to eat, and beged (clothes) to put on,"
Bereshis,28,21,So that I return to bais avi in shalom; then shall Hashem be for me Elohim (my G-d).
Bereshis,28,22,"And this even (stone) , which I have set for a matzevah (pillar) , shall be Beis Elohim: and of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely give the aser (tenth) unto Thee."
Bereshis,29,1,"Then Ya'akov went on his journey, and came into the eretz of the bnei kedem."
Bereshis,29,2,"And he looked, and hinei a be'er in the sadeh, and, hinei, there were shloshah edrei tzon lying by it; for out of that be'er they watered the edarim: and a great even (stone) was upon the mouth of the be'er."
Bereshis,29,3,"And to there were all the edarim gathered: and they rolled the even (stone) from the mouth of the be'er, and watered the tzon, and put the even (stone) again upon the mouth of the be'er in its place."
Bereshis,29,4,"And Ya'akov said unto them, My brethren, where are you from? And they said, Of Charan are we."
Bereshis,29,5,"And he said unto them, Know ye Lavan ben Nachor? And they said, We know him."
Bereshis,29,6,"And he said unto them, Is the shalom with him? And they said, Shalom; and, hinei, Rachel his bat cometh with the tzon."
Bereshis,29,7,"And he said, Look, the sun is still high, neither is it time that the flock should be gathered together; water ye the tzon, and go and feed them."
Bereshis,29,8,"And they said, We cannot, until all the edarim be gathered together, and till they roll the even (stone) from the mouth of the be'er; then we water the tzon."
Bereshis,29,9,"And while he yet spoke with them, Rachel came with the tzon of her av; for she was a ro'ah (shepherdess)."
Bereshis,29,10,"And it came to pass, when Ya'akov saw Rachel bat Lavan achi immo, and the tzon of Lavan achi immo, that Ya'akov went near, and rolled the even (stone) from the mouth of the be'er, and watered the tzon of Lavan achi immo."
Bereshis,29,11,"And Ya'akov kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept."
Bereshis,29,12,"And Ya'akov told Rachel that he was the relative of her av, and that he was ben Rivkah; and she ran and told her av."
Bereshis,29,13,"And it came to pass, when Lavan heard the news of Ya'akov ben achoto, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his bais. And he told Lavan all these things."
Bereshis,29,14,"And Lavan said to him, Surely thou art my etzem (bone) and my basar. And he abode with him the space of a chodesh (month)."
Bereshis,29,15,"And Lavan said unto Ya'akov, Because thou art my relative, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall thy maskoret (wages) be?"
Bereshis,29,16,"And Lavan had two banot: the shem of the elder was Leah, and the shem of the younger was Rachel."
Bereshis,29,17,Leah had weak eyes; but Rachel was yafeh and lovely in form.
Bereshis,29,18,"And Ya'akov loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee sheva shanim for Rachel thy bat haketannah (younger daughter)."
Bereshis,29,19,"And Lavan said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another ish; abide with me."
Bereshis,29,20,"And Ya'akov served sheva shanim for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few yamim, because of the ahavah he had for her."
Bereshis,29,21,"And Ya'akov said unto Lavan, Give me my isha, for my yamim are completed, that I may go in unto her."
Bereshis,29,22,"And Lavan gathered together all the anshei hamakom, and made a mishteh (feast)."
Bereshis,29,23,"And it came to pass in the erev, that he took Leah his bat, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her."
Bereshis,29,24,And Lavan gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah shifchato (his maid) for a shifchah.
Bereshis,29,25,"And it came to pass, that in the boker, hinei, it was Leah! And he said to Lavan, What is this thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? So why then hast thou deceived me?"
Bereshis,29,26,"And Lavan said, It must not be so done in our land, to give the younger before the bechirah."
Bereshis,29,27,"Finish her shvu'a (week) , and we will give thee this also for the avodah (service, work) which thou shalt do for me yet sheva shanim acherot."
Bereshis,29,28,"And Ya'akov did so, and fulfilled her shvu'a; and he gave him Rachel his bat to be his isha also."
Bereshis,29,29,And Lavan gave to his bat Rachel Bilhah his shifchah to be her shifchah.
Bereshis,29,30,"And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served him yet sheva shanim acherot."
Bereshis,29,31,"And when Hashem saw that Leah was hated, He opened her womb but Rachel was barren."
Bereshis,29,32,"And Leah conceived, and bore a ben, and she called shmo Reuven: for she said, Surely Hashem hath looked upon my misery; now therefore my ish will love me."
Bereshis,29,33,"And she conceived again, and bore ben; and said, Because Hashem hath heard I was hated, He hath therefore given me this also; and she called shmo Shim'on."
Bereshis,29,34,"And she conceived again, and bore ben; and said, Now this time will my ish yillaveh (become attached) unto me, because I have born him shloshah banim: therefore was shmo called Levi."
Bereshis,29,35,"And she conceived again, and bore ben; and she said, Now will odeh (I praise) Hashem ; therefore she called shmo Yehudah; and stopped giving birth."
Bereshis,30,1,"And when Rachel saw that she did not bear [banim] to Ya'akov, Rachel had kina toward her achot; and said unto Ya'akov, Give me banim, or else I die."
Bereshis,30,2,"And af Ya'akov was kindled against Rachel; and he said, Am I in place of Elohim, Who hath withheld from thee p'ri beten?"
Bereshis,30,3,"And she said, Hinei my amah (maidservant) Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my birkayim, that I may also build up through her."
Bereshis,30,4,"And she gave him Bilhah her shifchah (slave woman, maidservant) as isha; and Ya'akov went in unto her."
Bereshis,30,5,"And Bilhah conceived, and bore Ya'akov ben."
Bereshis,30,6,"And Rachel said, Elohim danani (G-d hath judged me) , and hath also heard my voice, and hath given to me ben: therefore called she shmo Dan."
Bereshis,30,7,"And Bilhah shifchat Rachel conceived again, and bore Ya'akov ben sheni."
Bereshis,30,8,"And Rachel said, With naftulei Elohim niftalti (with wrestlings of G-d have I wrestled) with my achot, and I have prevailed: and she called shmo Naphtali."
Bereshis,30,9,"When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took Zilpah her shifchah, and gave her to Ya'akov as isha."
Bereshis,30,10,And Zilpah shifchat Leah bore Ya'akov ben.
Bereshis,30,11,"And Leah said, BaGad (What Good Fortune!) And she called shmo Gad."
Bereshis,30,12,And Zilpah shifchat Leah bore Ya'akov ben sheni.
Bereshis,30,13,"And Leah said, B'Ashri (Happy am I) , for the banot will call me asher (blessed) : so she called shmo Asher."
Bereshis,30,14,"And Reuven went in the yemei ketzir chittim, and found duda'im (mandrakes) in the sadeh, and brought them unto Leah immo. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, now, of the duda'im of thy ben."
Bereshis,30,15,"And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my ish? And wouldest thou take away the duda'im of beni also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee halailah (tonight) for the duda'im of thy ben."
Bereshis,30,16,"And Ya'akov came in from the sadeh ba'erev, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with duda'im of beni. And he lay with her that night."
Bereshis,30,17,"And Elohim paid heed unto Leah, and she conceived, and bore Ya'akov ben chamishi."
Bereshis,30,18,"And Leah said, Elohim hath given me my hire, because I have given my shifchah to my ish; and she called shmo Yissakhar."
Bereshis,30,19,"And Leah conceived again, and bore Ya'akov ben shishi."
Bereshis,30,20,"And Leah said, Elohim hath endued me with a zeved tov (good endowment) ; now will my ish zabal (honor) me, because I have born him shisha banim; and she called shmo Zevulun."
Bereshis,30,21,"And afterwards she bore a bat, and called her shem Dinah."
Bereshis,30,22,"And Elohim remembered Rachel, and Elohim paid heed to her, and opened her rekhem (womb)."
Bereshis,30,23,"And she conceived, and bore ben; and said, Elohim hath taken away my cherpah (shame, disgrace, reproach);"
Bereshis,30,24,"And she called shmo Yosef; and said, yosef (may He add) , may Hashem add me ben acher (another son)."
Bereshis,30,25,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Yosef, that Ya'akov said unto Lavan, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own makom (place, home) and to my eretz."
Bereshis,30,26,"Give me my nashim and my yeladim, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my avodah which I have done thee."
Bereshis,30,27,"And Lavan said unto him, Now, if I have found chen (favor, grace) in thine eyes, tarry; for I have learned by nachash (divination) that Hashem hath made a brocha upon me for thy sake."
Bereshis,30,28,"And he said, Specify thy sachar (wages, reward) , and I will pay it."
Bereshis,30,29,"And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy mikneh fared with me."
Bereshis,30,30,"For it was me'at (little) which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and Hashem hath made a brocha upon thee since my coming; and now when shall I do for mine own bais also?"
Bereshis,30,31,"And he said, What shall I give thee? And Ya'akov said, Thou shalt not give me any thing; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again tend and be shomer over thy tzon."
Bereshis,30,32,"I will pass through all thy tzon today, removing from there speckled and spotted seh, and every dark seh among the kesavim, and the spotted and speckled among the izzim; and of such shall be my sachar."
Bereshis,30,33,"So shall my tzedakah answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my sachar before thy face; every one that is not speckled and spotted among the izzim, and dark among the kesavim, that shall be counted a ganavʼs with me."
Bereshis,30,34,"And Lavan said, Agreed, I would it might be according to thy davar."
Bereshis,30,35,"And he removed that day the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the izzim that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some lavan in it, and all the dark among the kesavim, and gave them into the yad of his banim."
Bereshis,30,36,And he set a derech shloshet yamim between himself and Ya'akov; and Ya'akov tended the rest of the tzon Lavan.
Bereshis,30,37,"And Ya'akov took him fresh cut makal (rod, branch) of poplar and of almond and plane tree; and peeled strips of bark in them, and made the lavan (white) appear which was in the maklot (rods, branches)."
Bereshis,30,38,"And he set the maklot which he had peeled before the flocks in the small channels of the shikatot mayim (watering troughs) when the tzon came to drink. And since they bred when they came to drink,"
Bereshis,30,39,"And the flocks bred before the maklot, and brought forth tzon streaked, speckled, and spotted."
Bereshis,30,40,"And Ya'akov did separate the kesavim, and set the faces of the tzon toward the streaked, and all the dark in the tzon Lavan; and he put his own adarim (flocks) by themselves, and put them not unto the tzon Lavan."
Bereshis,30,41,"And it came to pass, whensoever tzon hamekusharot (the stronger flock) did breed, that Ya'akov set the maklot before the eyes of the tzon in the trough channels, that they might breed among the maklot."
Bereshis,30,42,"But when the tzon were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler would belong to Lavan, and the stronger to Ya'akov."
Bereshis,30,43,"And the ish increased exceedingly, and had much tzon, and shefachot, and avadim, and gemalim, and chamorim."
Bereshis,31,1,"And he heard the divrei Bnei Lavan, saying, Ya'akov hath taken away all that belonged to avinu; and of that which belonged to avinu hath he gotten all this kavod."
Bereshis,31,2,"And Ya'akov beheld the countenance of Lavan, and, hinei, it was not toward him as before."
Bereshis,31,3,"And Hashem said unto Ya'akov, Shuv el Eretz Avoteicha! And to thy moledet; and I will be with thee."
Bereshis,31,4,"And Ya'akov sent and called Rachel and Leah to the sadeh unto his tzon,"
Bereshis,31,5,"And said unto them, I see penei avichen, that it is not toward me as before; but Elohei Avi is with me."
Bereshis,31,6,And ye know that with all my koach I have served avichen.
Bereshis,31,7,"And avichen hath deceived me, and changed my sachar aseret monim but Elohim allowed him not to harm me."
Bereshis,31,8,"If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy sachar; then all the tzon bore speckled; and if he said thus, The streaked shall be thy sachar; then bore all the tzon streaked."
Bereshis,31,9,"Thus Elohim hath taken away the mikneh of your av, and given them to me."
Bereshis,31,10,"And it came to pass at the time that the tzon breed, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a chalom, and, hinei, the male goats mounting the tzon were streaked, speckled, and spotted."
Bereshis,31,11,"And the Malach HaElohim spoke unto me in a chalom saying, Ya'akov: And I said, Hineni."
Bereshis,31,12,"And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the male goats leaping upon the tzon are streaked, speckled, and spotted; for I have seen all that Lavan doeth unto thee."
Bereshis,31,13,"I am HaEl Beit-El, where thou anointedst a matzevah (pillar) , and where thou vowedst a neder (vow) unto Me: now arise, get thee out from HaAretz Hazot, and return unto thy eretz moledet."
Bereshis,31,14,"And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any chelek or nachalah for us in bais avinu?"
Bereshis,31,15,"Are we not regarded by him nokhriyyot (foreigners, strangers) ? For he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our kesef."
Bereshis,31,16,"For all the oisher Elohim hath taken from avinu, that belongs to us and baneinu; so then, whatsoever Elohim hath said unto thee, do."
Bereshis,31,17,"Then Ya'akov rose up, and set his banim and his nashim upon the gemalim;"
Bereshis,31,18,"And he drove all his mikneh, and all his goods which he had gotten, the mikneh of his getting, which he had gotten in Paddan-Aram, for to go to Yitzchak aviv in Eretz Kena'an."
Bereshis,31,19,And Lavan went to shear his tzon; and Rachel had stolen the terafim that belong to her av.
Bereshis,31,20,"Unawares to Lavan HaArami, Ya'akov stole away, in that he told him not that he was fleeing."
Bereshis,31,21,"So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the Nahar [i.e. the Euphrates], and set his face toward Har Gil'ad."
Bereshis,31,22,And it was told Lavan on Yom HaShlishi that Ya'akov was fled.
Bereshis,31,23,"And he took his achim with him, and pursued after him derech shivat yamim; and they overtook him at Har Gil'ad."
Bereshis,31,24,"And Elohim came to Lavan HaArami in a chalom halailah, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Ya'akov either tov or rah."
Bereshis,31,25,Then Lavan overtook Ya'akov. Now Ya'akov had pitched his ohel on the har; and Lavan with his achim encamped in Har Gil'ad.
Bereshis,31,26,"And Lavan said to Ya'akov, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my banot, like shevuyot (captives) taken with the cherev?"
Bereshis,31,27,"Why didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with simchah, and with shirim (songs) , with tof (timbrel, tambourine) and with kinnor (harp)?"
Bereshis,31,28,And hast not allowed me to kiss my banim (grandchildren) and my banot? Thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
Bereshis,31,29,"It is in the power of my yad to do you rah; but Elohei Avichem spoke unto me emesh (last night) , saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Ya'akov either tov or rah."
Bereshis,31,30,"And now, though thou had to go, because thou greatly longedst after bais avicha, yet why hast thou stolen elohai?"
Bereshis,31,31,"And Ya'akov answered and said to Lavan, Because I was afraid; for I said, Thou wouldest take by force thy banot from me."
Bereshis,31,32,"With whomsoever thou findest eloheicha, let him not live; before acheinu discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Ya'akov knew not that Rachel had played the ganav with them."
Bereshis,31,33,"And Lavan went into the ohel Ya'akov, and into the ohel Leah and into the ohel shtei ha'amahot; but he found them not. Then went he out of the ohel Leah, and entered into the ohel Rachel."
Bereshis,31,34,"Now Rachel had taken the terafim, and put them in the saddle of the gamal, and sat upon them. And Lavan searched all the ohel, but found them not."
Bereshis,31,35,"And she said to her av, Let it not displease adoni that I cannot rise up in thy presence; for the derech nashim is upon me. And he searched but found not the terafim."
Bereshis,31,36,"And Ya'akov was in wrath, and upbraided Lavan: and Ya'akov answered and said to Lavan, What is my peysha? What is my chattat, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?"
Bereshis,31,37,"Whereas thou hast searched through all that I own, what hast thou found of all thy kelei bais? Set it here before my achim and thy achim, that they may judge between us both."
Bereshis,31,38,"These esrim shanah have I been with thee; recheleicha (thy ewes) and thy female goats have not miscarried, and the rams of thy tzon have I not eaten."
Bereshis,31,39,"That which was treifah (torn of beasts) I brought not unto thee; I bore the loss of it; of my yad didst thou require it, whether stolen by yom, or stolen by lailah."
Bereshis,31,40,"Thus I was; in the yom the chorev (heat) consumed me, and the kerach (cold) by lailah; and my sheynah (sleep) departed from mine eyes."
Bereshis,31,41,"Thus have I been esrim shanah in thy bais; I served thee arba-esreh shanah for thy two banot, and shesh shanim for thy tzon: and thou hast changed my sachar aseret monim."
Bereshis,31,42,"Except Elohei Avi, Elohei Avraham, and the Pachad of Yitzchak had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty handed. Elohim hath seen mine oni and the toil of my palms, and rebuked thee emesh (last night)."
Bereshis,31,43,"And Lavan answered and said unto Ya'akov, These banot are my banot, and these banim are my banim, and this tzon is my tzon, and all that thou seest is mine; yet what can I do today about these my banot, or about their banim which they have born?"
Bereshis,31,44,"Now therefore come thou, let us cut a brit, I and thou; and let it be for an ed between me and thee."
Bereshis,31,45,"And Ya'akov took an even, and set it up for a matzevah (pillar)."
Bereshis,31,46,"And Ya'akov said unto his achim, Gather avanim; and they took avanim, and made a gal (heap, mound) ; and they did eat there upon the gal."
Bereshis,31,47,And Lavan called it Yegar Sahaduta; but Ya'akov called it Gale'ed (“Heap of Witness”).
Bereshis,31,48,"And Lavan said, This gal (heap, mound) is an ed (witness) between me and thee this day. Therefore was shmo called Gale'ed;"
Bereshis,31,49,"And Mitzpah (Watch) ; for he said, Hashem watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another."
Bereshis,31,50,"If thou shalt afflict my banot, or if thou shalt take nashim besides my banot, no man is with us; see, Elohim ed beini uveinecha (Elohim is witness between me and you)."
Bereshis,31,51,"And Lavan said to Ya'akov, Hinei this gal (heap, mound) , and hinei the matzevah (pillar) , which I have cast between me and thee;"
Bereshis,31,52,"This gal (heap, mound) be ed (witness) , and this matzevah (pillar) be edah (witness) , that for ra'ah I will not pass over this gal to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this gal and this matzevah unto me."
Bereshis,31,53,"The Elohei Avraham, and Elohei Nachor, Elohei Avihem judge between us. And Ya'akov swore by the Pachad Aviv Yitzchak."
Bereshis,31,54,"Then Ya'akov offered zavach upon the har, and called his achim to eat lechem; and they did eat lechem, and tarried all night on the har."
Bereshis,31,55,"And early in the boker (morning) Lavan rose up, and kissed his banim and his banot, and made on them a brocha; and Lavan departed, and returned unto his makom."
Bereshis,32,1,"And Ya'akov went on his derech, and the malachim of Elohim met him."
Bereshis,32,2,"And when Ya'akov saw them, he said, This is Mahaneh Elohim; and he called the shem of that makom (place) Machanayim."
Bereshis,32,3,"And Ya'akov sent malachim before him to Esav achiv unto Eretz Se'ir, the country of Edom."
Bereshis,32,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto adoni Esav; Thy eved Ya'akov saith thus, I have sojourned with Lavan, and stayed there until now;"
Bereshis,32,5,"And I have shor (oxen) , and chamor, tzon, and eved, and shifchah; and I have sent to tell adoni, that I may find chen (grace) in thy sight."
Bereshis,32,6,"And the malachim returned to Ya'akov, saying, We came to Esav achicha, and also he cometh to meet thee, and arba me'ot ish with him."
Bereshis,32,7,"Then Ya'akov was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided HaAm that was with him, and the tzon, and bakar, and the gemalim, into two machanot;"
Bereshis,32,8,"And said, If Esav come to the one machaneh, and attack it, then the other machaneh which is left shall escape."
Bereshis,32,9,"And Ya'akov said, O Elohei Avi Avraham, and Elohei Avi Yitzchak, Hashem which saidst unto me, Shuv l'aretzecha and to thy moledet (kindred) , and I will deal well with thee;"
Bereshis,32,10,"I am not worthy of the least of all the chasadim, and of all the emes, which Thou hast showed unto Thy eved; for with my makal (rod, staff) I passed over this Yarden; and now I am become two machanot."
Bereshis,32,11,"Save me, now, from the yad achi, from the yad Esav; for I fear him, lest he will come and attack me, em with banim."
Bereshis,32,12,"But Thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy zera as the chol of the yam, which cannot be numbered for multitude."
Bereshis,32,13,And he spent there that same night; and took of that which came to his yad a minchah for Esav achiv;
Bereshis,32,14,"Two hundred female goats, and twenty male goats, two hundred rechelim (ewes) , and twenty eilim (rams),"
Bereshis,32,15,"Thirty nursing gemalim with their colts, forty parot (cows) , and ten parim (bulls) , twenty female donkeys, and ten male donkeys."
Bereshis,32,16,"And he delivered them into the yad of his avadim, every herd by itself; and said unto his avadim, Pass over before me, and keep a space between herd and herd."
Bereshis,32,17,"And he commanded the rishon, saying, When Esav achi meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? And to where goest thou? And whose are these [animals] before thee?"
Bereshis,32,18,"Then thou shalt say, They are of thy eved Ya'akov; it is a minchah sent unto adoni Esav; and, hinei, also he is behind us."
Bereshis,32,19,"And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the adarim (herds) , saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esav, when ye find him."
Bereshis,32,20,"And say ye moreover, Hinei, thy eved Ya'akov is behind us. For he said, Akhapperah (I will appease, cover) his face with the minchah that goeth ahead of me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me."
Bereshis,32,21,So went the minchah (present) over ahead of him; but he himself stayed balailah in the machaneh.
Bereshis,32,22,"And he rose up that night, and took his two nashim and his two shifchot, and his eleven yeladim, and passed over the ma'avar (ford) Yabbok."
Bereshis,32,23,"And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over [all] that he had."
Bereshis,32,24,"And Ya'akov was left by himself; and there wrestled an ish with him until the shachar (dawn, sunup)."
Bereshis,32,25,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he struck his hip socket; so Ya'akovʼs hip socket dislocated while he wrestled with him."
Bereshis,32,26,"And he said, Let me go, for shachar breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, unless thou make a berakhah upon me."
Bereshis,32,27,"And he said unto him, What is shemecha? And he said, Ya'akov."
Bereshis,32,28,"And he said, Shimcha shall be called no more Ya'akov, but Yisroel: for sarita im Elohim ([yisrah=to prevail + El=G-d = Yisroel] ye have striven with Elohim) and with anashim, and hast overcome."
Bereshis,32,29,"And Ya'akov asked him, and said, Tell me, now, shemecha. And he said, Why is it that thou dost ask after shmi? And he made a brocha upon him there."
Bereshis,32,30,"And Ya'akov called the shem of the makom (place) Peniel (Face of G-d) : for I have seen Elohim panim el panim, and my nefesh is saved."
Bereshis,32,31,"And as he passed over Penuel the shemesh rose upon him, and he limped upon his hip."
Bereshis,32,32,"Therefore the Bnei Yisroel eat not of the sinew of the thigh vein (sciatic nerve) which is upon the hip socket, unto this day; because he touched the hip socket of Ya'akov in the sinew of the thigh vein."
Bereshis,33,1,"And Ya'akov lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, hinei, Esav came, and with him arba me'ot ish (four hundred men) . And he divided the yeladim unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two shefachot."
Bereshis,33,2,"And he put the shefachot and their yeladim rishonah, and Leah and her yeladim acharonim, and Rachel and Yosef acharonim."
Bereshis,33,3,"And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground sheva pe'amim, until he came near to achiv (his brother)."
Bereshis,33,4,"And Esav ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his tzavar (neck) , and kissed him; and they wept."
Bereshis,33,5,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the nashim and the yeladim; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The yeladim which Elohim hath graciously given thy eved."
Bereshis,33,6,"Then the shefachot came near, they and their yeladim, and they bowed themselves."
Bereshis,33,7,"And Leah also with her yeladim came near, and bowed themselves; and after came Yosef near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves."
Bereshis,33,8,"And he said, What meanest thou by all this machaneh which I met? And he said, These are to find chen (grace) in the eyes of adoni."
Bereshis,33,9,"And Esav said, I have enough, achi (my brother) ; keep that thou hast unto thyself."
Bereshis,33,10,"And Ya'akov said, No, now, if I have found chen (grace) in thy sight, then receive my minchah at my yad inasmuch as I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the p'nei Elohim (the face of G-d) vatirtzeini (and thou wast pleased to accept me, thou wast appeased by me)."
Bereshis,33,11,"Accept, now, my brocha that is brought to thee; because Elohim hath dealt graciously with me, and because yesh li khol (there is to me all, my needs are met) . And he urged him, and he accepted."
Bereshis,33,12,"And he said, Nise'ah (let us take our journey) , and let us go, I will go next to thee."
Bereshis,33,13,"And he said unto him, Adoni knoweth that the yeladim are tender and the nursing tzon and bakar are upon me; and if men should overdrive them yom echad, all the tzon will die."
Bereshis,33,14,"Let now adoni, pass over before his eved; and I will lead on slowly, according to the pace of the drove that goeth before me and the pace the yeladim are able to endure, until I come unto adoni at Se'ir."
Bereshis,33,15,"And Esav said, Let me now leave with thee some of HaAm that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? Let me find chen in the sight of adoni."
Bereshis,33,16,So Esav returned that day on his derech unto Se'ir.
Bereshis,33,17,"And Ya'akov journeyed to Sukkot, and built him a bais, and made sukkot for his mikneh; therefore the shem of the makom is called Sukkot."
Bereshis,33,18,"And Ya'akov came shalem to Ir Shechem, which is in eretz Kena'an, when he came from Paddan-Aram; and encamped before the Ir."
Bereshis,33,19,"And he bought a chelkat hasadeh (piece of land) , where he had pitched there his ohel, from the yad Bnei Chamor Avi Shechem, for a hundred pieces of kesitah (money)."
Bereshis,33,20,"And he erected there a Mizbe'ach, and called it El Elohei Yisroel."
Bereshis,34,1,"And Dinah Bat Leah, which she bore unto Ya'akov, went out to see the Banot HaAretz."
Bereshis,34,2,"And when Shechem Ben Chamor the Chivi (Hivite) , Nasi HaAretz, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and violated her."
Bereshis,34,3,"And his nefesh had deveykus unto Dinah Bat Ya'akov, and he loved the na'arah, and spoke to the lev hanaarah."
Bereshis,34,4,"And Shechem spoke unto Chamor aviv, saying, Get me this yaldah as isha."
Bereshis,34,5,And Ya'akov heard that he had made his bat Dinah tameh; now his banim were with his mikneh in the sadeh; and Ya'akov held his peace until they were come.
Bereshis,34,6,And Chamor avi Shechem went out unto Ya'akov to speak with him.
Bereshis,34,7,"And the Bnei Ya'akov came from the sadeh when they heard it; and the anashim were grieved, and they were in wrath greatly, because he had wrought nevalah (folly, disgrace, outrage) against Yisroel in lying with Bat Ya'akov; which thing ought not to be done."
Bereshis,34,8,"And Chamor spoke with them, saying, The nefesh of beni (my son) Shechem longeth for your bat; now give her him as isha."
Bereshis,34,9,"So intermarry with us, and give your banot unto us, and take benoteinu (our banot) unto you."
Bereshis,34,10,"And ye shall dwell with us; and HaAretz shall be before you; dwell and trade therein, and get you possessions therein."
Bereshis,34,11,"And Shechem said unto her av and unto her achim, Let me find chen (grace) in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give."
Bereshis,34,12,"Ask me never so much mohar (bride price, dowry) and mattan (gift) , and I will pay according as ye shall say unto me; but give me the na'arah as isha."
Bereshis,34,13,And the Bnei Ya'akov answered Shechem and Chamor aviv in mirmar (deceit) and spoke because he had made Dinah their achot tameh;
Bereshis,34,14,"And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give achoteinu (our sister) to ish that is arelah (uncircumcised) ; for that would be a cherpah (reproach, disgrace) unto us;"
Bereshis,34,15,"But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will become like us, that every zachar of you be circumcised;"
Bereshis,34,16,"Then will we give benoteinu unto you, and we will take your banot to us, and we will dwell among you, and we will become as Am Echad."
Bereshis,34,17,"But if ye will not pay heed unto us, to become circumcised; then will we take biteinu (our daughter) , and we will go."
Bereshis,34,18,"And their words pleased Chamor, and Shechem Ben Chamor."
Bereshis,34,19,"And the na'ar deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Bat Ya'akov; and he was more respected than kol Bais Aviv."
Bereshis,34,20,"And Chamor and Shechem bno came unto the Sha'ar of their city, and they spoke with the anashim of their city, saying,"
Bereshis,34,21,"These anashim are shlemim (peaceable) with us; therefore let them settle in HaAretz, and let them trade therein for HaAretz, hinei, it is plenty of room for them; let us take their banot to us as nashim, and let us give them benoteinu."
Bereshis,34,22,"Only herein will the anashim consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be Am Echad, if every zachar among us be circumcised, just as they are nimolim (ones being circumcised)."
Bereshis,34,23,"Shall not their mikneh and their property and every behemah of theirs be ours? Only let us consent unto them, and they will settle among us."
Bereshis,34,24,"And unto Chamor and unto Shechem bno paid heed all that went out of the Sha'ar of his city; and every zachar was circumcised, all that went out of the Sha'ar of his city."
Bereshis,34,25,"And it came to pass on the Yom HaShlishi, when they were in pain, that two of the Bnei Ya'akov, Shim'on and Levi, achei Dinah, took each ish his cherev, and came upon the Ir betach (boldly, confidently) , and they slaughtered kol zachar."
Bereshis,34,26,"And they slaughtered Chamor and Shechem bno with the edge of the cherev, and took Dinah from the Bais Shechem and left."
Bereshis,34,27,"The Bnei Ya'akov came upon the chalalim (dead ones, slain ones) , and plundered the Ir, because they had made their achot tameh."
Bereshis,34,28,"They seized their tzon, and their bakar, and their chamorim, and that which was in the Ir, and that which was in the sadeh,"
Bereshis,34,29,"And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their nashim they carried off and plundered even all that was in the bais."
Bereshis,34,30,"And Ya'akov said to Shim'on and Levi, Ye have brought trouble on me to make me a stench among the inhabitants of HaAretz, among the Kena'ani and the Perizzi; and I being few in mispar, they shall gather themselves together against me, and attack me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my bais."
Bereshis,34,31,"And they said, Should he deal with achoteinu like with zonah?"
Bereshis,35,1,"And Elohim said unto Ya'akov, Arise, go up to Beit-El, and settle there; and make there a Mizbe'ach unto El (G-d) that appeared unto thee when thou didst flee from the face of Esav achicha."
Bereshis,35,2,"Then Ya'akov said unto his Bais, and to all that were with him, Put away the elohei hanekhar that are among you, and be tahor, and change your simlah (garments);"
Bereshis,35,3,"And let us arise, and go up to Beit-El; and I will build there a Mizbe'ach unto El (G-d) Who answered me in my yom tzoros, and was with me in the derech in which I went."
Bereshis,35,4,"And they gave unto Ya'akov kol elohei hanekhar which were in their yad, and all their nezamim which were in their oznayim; and Ya'akov buried them under the elah (terebinth) which was at Shechem."
Bereshis,35,5,"And they journeyed; and the chittat Elohim (terror of G-d) was upon the cities that were around them, and they did not pursue after the Bnei Ya'akov."
Bereshis,35,6,"So Ya'akov came to Luz, which is in Eretz Kena'an, that is, Beit-El, he and kol haAm that were with him."
Bereshis,35,7,"And he built there a Mizbe'ach, and called the makom (place) El Beit-El; because there HaElohim appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of achiv."
Bereshis,35,8,"But Devorah meineket Rivkah died, and she was buried under an alon (oak) below Beit-El; and shmo was called Alon Bachut."
Bereshis,35,9,"And Elohim appeared unto Ya'akov again, when he returned from Paddan-Aram, and made a brocha upon him."
Bereshis,35,10,"And Elohim said unto him, Shimcha is Ya'akov; shimcha shall not be called any more Ya'akov, but Yisroel shall be shemecha; and He called shmo Yisroel."
Bereshis,35,11,"And Elohim said unto him, I am El Shaddai; be fruitful and multiply; a Goy (nation) and a Kehal Goyim shall be from thee, and Melechim shall come out of thy loins;"
Bereshis,35,12,"And HaAretz which I gave Avraham and Yitzchak, to thee I will give it, and to thy zera after thee will I give HaAretz."
Bereshis,35,13,And Elohim went up from him in the makom where He talked with him.
Bereshis,35,14,"And Ya'akov set up a matzevah (pillar, monument) in the makom where He talked with him, even a matzevat even (pillar of stone) ; and he poured a nesech (drink offering) thereon, and he poured shemen (oil) thereon."
Bereshis,35,15,"And Ya'akov called the shem of the makom where Elohim spoke with him, Beit-El."
Bereshis,35,16,"And they journeyed from Beit-El; and there was still a space of ha'aretz to get to Ephratah; and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor."
Bereshis,35,17,"And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the meyaledet (midwife) said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this ben also."
Bereshis,35,18,"And it came to pass, as her nefesh was in departing, (for she died) that she called shmo Ben-Oni (Son of Affliction) ; but aviv called him Binyamin."
Bereshis,35,19,"And Rachel died, and was buried on the derech to Ephratah, which is Beit-Lechem."
Bereshis,35,20,And Ya'akov set up a matzevah upon her kever; that is matzevet kevurat Rachel to this day.
Bereshis,35,21,"And Yisroel journeyed, and pitched his ohel beyond Migdal-Eder."
Bereshis,35,22,"And it came to pass, when Yisroel dwelt in that land, that Reuven went and lay with Bilhah pilegesh aviv and Yisroel heard it. Now the Bnei Ya'akov were Sheneym Asar (Twelve);"
Bereshis,35,23,"The Bnei Leah: Reuven bechor Ya'akov, and Shim'on, and Levi, and Yehudah, and Yissakhar, and Zevulun;"
Bereshis,35,24,"The Bnei Rachel: Yosef, and Binyamin;"
Bereshis,35,25,"And the Bnei Bilhah shifchat Rachel: Dan, and Naphtali;"
Bereshis,35,26,"And the Bnei Zilpah shifchat Leah: Gad, and Asher; these are the Bnei Ya'akov, which were born to him in Paddan-Aram."
Bereshis,35,27,"And Ya'akov came unto Yitzchak Aviv unto Mamre, unto Kiriat-HaArba, which is Chevron, where Avraham and Yitzchak sojourned."
Bereshis,35,28,And the days of Yitzchak were me'at shanah u'shemonim shanah.
Bereshis,35,29,"And Yitzchak expired, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being zaken (old) and full of yamim; and his banim Esav and Ya'akov buried him."
Bereshis,36,1,"Now these are the toldot Esav, who is Edom."
Bereshis,36,2,"Esav took his nashim of the Banot Kena'an: Adah Bat Elon the Chitti, and Oholivamah Bat Anah Bat Tziveon the Chivi;"
Bereshis,36,3,"And Basmat Bat Yishmael, achot Nevayot."
Bereshis,36,4,And Adah bore to Esav Eliphaz; and Basmat bore Reuel;
Bereshis,36,5,"And Oholivamah bore Ye'ush, and Ya'alam, and Korach; these are the Bnei Esav, which were born unto him in Eretz Kena'an."
Bereshis,36,6,"And Esav took his nashim, and his banim, and his banot, and kol nafshot of his bais, and his mikneh, and all his behemah, and all his possessions, which he had acquired in Eretz Kena'an; and went into the eretz from the face of Ya'akov achiv."
Bereshis,36,7,For their wealth was more than that they might dwell together; and the eretz of their sojourns could not support them because of their mikneh.
Bereshis,36,8,Thus dwelt Esav in har Se'ir; Esav is Edom.
Bereshis,36,9,And these are the toldot Esav avi Edom in har Se'ir:
Bereshis,36,10,"These are the shemot Bnei Esav; Eliphaz Ben Adah eshet Esav, Reuel Ben Basmat eshet Esav."
Bereshis,36,11,"And the Bnei Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Tzepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz."
Bereshis,36,12,And Timna was pilegesh (concubine) to Eliphaz Ben Esav; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek; these were the Bnei Adah eshet Esav.
Bereshis,36,13,"And these are the Bnei Reuel: Nachat, and Zerach, Shammah, and Mizzah; these were the Bnei Basmat eshet Esav."
Bereshis,36,14,"And these were the Bnei Oholivamah Bat Anah Bat Tziveon, eshet Esav: and she bore to Esav Ye'ush, and Ya'alam, and Korach."
Bereshis,36,15,"These were alufei (chiefs) of the Bnei Esav: the Bnei Eliphaz the bechor Esav; aluf (chief) Teman, aluf Omar, aluf Tzepho, aluf Kenaz,"
Bereshis,36,16,"Aluf (chief) Korach, aluf (chief) Gatam, and aluf (chief) Amalek; these are the alufei Eliphaz in Eretz Edom; these were the Bnei Adah."
Bereshis,36,17,"And these are the Bnei Reuel Ben Esav: aluf (chief) Nachat, aluf Zerach, aluf Shammah, aluf Mizzah; these are the alufei Reuel in Eretz Edom; these are the Bnei Basmat eshet Esav."
Bereshis,36,18,"And these are the Bnei Oholivamah eshet Esav: aluf (chief) Ye'ush, aluf Ya'alam, aluf Korach; these were the alufei Oholivamah Bat Anah eshet Esav."
Bereshis,36,19,"These are the Bnei Esav, who is Edom, and these are their alufim (chiefs)."
Bereshis,36,20,"These are the Bnei Se'ir the Chori, who inhabited HaAretz: Lotan, and Shoval, and Tziveon, and Anah,"
Bereshis,36,21,"And Dishon, and Etzer, and Dishan; these are the alufei HaChori, the Bnei Se'ir in Eretz Edom."
Bereshis,36,22,And the Bnei Lotan were Chori and Hemam; and achot Lotan was Timna.
Bereshis,36,23,"And the Bnei Shoval were these: Alvan, and Manachat, and Eival, Shepho, and Onam."
Bereshis,36,24,"And these are the Bnei Tziveon: both Ayah, and Anah; this was that Anah that found the hot springs in the midbar, as he pastured the chamorim of Tziveon aviv."
Bereshis,36,25,"And the Bnei Anah were these: Dishon, and Oholivamah Bat Anah."
Bereshis,36,26,"And these are the Bnei Dishon: Chemdan, and Eshban, and Yitran, and Keran."
Bereshis,36,27,"The Bnei Etzer are these: Bilhan, and Za'avan, and Akan."
Bereshis,36,28,"The Bnei Dishan are these: Utz, and Aran."
Bereshis,36,29,"These are the alufei (chiefs) haChori: aluf (chief) Lotan, aluf Shoval, aluf Tziveon, aluf Anah,"
Bereshis,36,30,"Aluf Dishon, aluf Etzer, aluf (chief) Dishan; these are the alufei haChori by their alufim (chiefs) in Eretz Se'ir."
Bereshis,36,31,"And these are the melechim that reigned in Eretz Edom, before there reigned any melech over the Bnei Yisroel."
Bereshis,36,32,And Bela Ben Be'or reigned in Edom; and the shem of his city was Dinhavah.
Bereshis,36,33,"And Bela died, and Yovav Ben Zerach of Botzrah reigned in his place."
Bereshis,36,34,"And Yovav died, and Chusham of Eretz Temani reigned in his place."
Bereshis,36,35,"And Chusham died, and Hadad Ben Bedad, who defeated Midyan in the sadeh of Moav, reigned in his place; and the shem of his city was Avit."
Bereshis,36,36,"And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place."
Bereshis,36,37,"And Samlah died, and Sha'ul of Rechovot-nahar reigned in his place."
Bereshis,36,38,"And Sha'ul died, and Ba'al-Chanan Ben Achbor reigned in his place."
Bereshis,36,39,"And Ba'al-Chanan Ben Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his place; and the shem of his city was Pau; and the shem of his isha was Mehetavel Bat Matred Bat Mei-Zahav."
Bereshis,36,40,"And these are the shemot of the alufei Esav, according to their mishpechot, after their mekomot, by their shemot: aluf (chief) Timna, aluf (chief) Alvah, aluf (chief) Yetet,"
Bereshis,36,41,"Aluf Oholivamah, aluf (chief) Elah, aluf (chief) Pinon,"
Bereshis,36,42,"Aluf (chief) Kenaz, aluf (chief) Teman, aluf (chief) Mivtzar,"
Bereshis,36,43,"Aluf (chief) Magdiel, aluf (chief) Iram; these are the alufei Edom, according to their moshavot in the eretz of their achuzzah; this is Esav Avi Edom."
Bereshis,37,1,And Ya'akov dwelt in the eretz megurei Aviv (in the land wherein his father was a ger) in Eretz Kena'an.
Bereshis,37,2,"These are the toldot Ya'akov. Yosef, being seventeen years old, was ro'eh with his achim to the tzon; now the na'ar was with the bnei Bilhah, and with the bnei Zilpah, the ne'shei Aviv (the wives of his father) ; and Yosef brought unto Avihem (their father) dibbatam ra'ah (a bad, evil report of them)."
Bereshis,37,3,"Now Yisroel loved Yosef more than all his children, because he was the ben zekunim (the son of his old age) ; and he made him a kesones passim (ketonet [tunic] reaching to palms and soles)."
Bereshis,37,4,"And when his achim saw that Avihem loved him more than all his achim, they hated him, and could not speak with shalom unto him."
Bereshis,37,5,"And Yosef dreamed a chalom (dream), and he told it to his achim; and they hated him yet the more."
Bereshis,37,6,"And he said unto them, Hear, now, this chalom which I have dreamed:"
Bereshis,37,7,"For, hinei, we were binding alummim (sheaves of wheat) out in the sadeh, and, hinei, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, hinei, your alummot (sheaves of wheat) gathered around it, and bowed down to my sheaf."
Bereshis,37,8,"And his achim said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his chalomot (dreams) , and for his devarim."
Bereshis,37,9,"And he dreamed yet another chalom, and told it his achim, and said, Hinei, I have dreamed a chalom more; and, hinei, the shemesh and the yarei'ach and the eleven kokhavim bowed down to me."
Bereshis,37,10,"And he told it to Aviv, and to his achim: and Aviv rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this chalom that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and Immecha and Achecha indeed come to bow down ourselves to the ground before thee?"
Bereshis,37,11,"And his achim had kina (jealousy, envy) toward him; but Aviv was shomer over the saying."
Bereshis,37,12,And his achim went for the purpose to be ro'eh tzon Avihem in the vicinity of Shechem.
Bereshis,37,13,"And Yisroel said unto Yosef, Do not thy achim ro'im in Shechem? Come and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Hineni."
Bereshis,37,14,"And he said to him, Go, now, see about the shalom achecha, and the shalom hatzon; and bring me devar. So he sent him out of the Emek Chevron, and he went to Shechem."
Bereshis,37,15,"And a certain ish found him, and, hinei, he was wandering in the sadeh; and the ish asked him, saying, What seekest thou?"
Bereshis,37,16,"And he said, I seek my achim; tell me, now, where they ro'im (feed their flocks)."
Bereshis,37,17,"And the ish said, They are departed from here; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dotan. And Yosef went after his achim, and found them in Dotan."
Bereshis,37,18,"And when they saw him merachok (afar off, in the distance) , even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to kill him."
Bereshis,37,19,"And they said one to another, Hinei, this ba'al hachalomot cometh."
Bereshis,37,20,"Come now therefore, and let us kill him, and throw him into one of the borot (pits) , and we will say, Some chayyah ra'ah (evil wild beast) hath devoured him; and we shall see what will become of his chalomot."
Bereshis,37,21,"And Reuven heard it, and he saved him out of their yadayim; and said, Let us not take his nefesh."
Bereshis,37,22,"And Reuven said unto them, Do no shefach dahm (shedding of blood) , but throw him into this bor that is in the midbar, and lay no yad upon him; that he might rescue him out of their yadayim, to take him back to Aviv."
Bereshis,37,23,"And it came to pass, when Yosef was come unto his achim, that they stripped Yosef of his kesones, his kesones hapassim that was on him;"
Bereshis,37,24,"And they took him, and threw him into the borah (pit) ; and the bor was empty, there was no mayim in it."
Bereshis,37,25,"And they sat down to eat lechem; and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, hinei, a caravan of Yishm'elim was coming from Gil'ad with their gemalim bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Mitzrayim."
Bereshis,37,26,"And Yehudah said unto his achim, What betza (profit, gain) is it if we kill achinu (our brother) , and conceal his dahm?"
Bereshis,37,27,"Come, and let us sell him to the Yishm'elim, and let not yadeinu (our hands) be upon him; for he is achinu (our brother) and besareinu (our flesh) . And his achim agreed."
Bereshis,37,28,"Then there passed by anashim Midyanim socharim (men of Midyan, traders) ; and they drew and lifted up Yosef out of the bor, and sold Yosef to the Yishm'elim for esrim kesef; and they took Yosef to Mitzrayim."
Bereshis,37,29,"And Reuven returned unto the bor; and, hinei, Yosef was not in the bor; and he made the keriah of his clothes."
Bereshis,37,30,"And he returned unto his achim, and said, The yeled is not; and I, where shall I turn?"
Bereshis,37,31,"And they took the kesones Yosef, and did shachat the se'ir izzim (slaughtered the kid of the goats) , and dipped the kesones in the dahm;"
Bereshis,37,32,"And they sent the kesones hapassim, and they brought it to Avihem; and said, This have we found; examine for identification purposes now whether it be the kesones Binecha or no."
Bereshis,37,33,"And he recognized it, and said, It is the kesones beni; a chayyah ra'ah hath devoured him; Yosef is without doubt torn in pieces."
Bereshis,37,34,"And Ya'akov made the keriah of his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for beno yamim rabbim."
Bereshis,37,35,"And all his banim and all his banot rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to beni mourning to Sheol. Thus Aviv wept for him."
Bereshis,37,36,"And the Midyanim sold him into Mitzrayim unto Potiphar, a seris Pharaoh (courtier of Pharaoh) , a sar hatabbachim (a captain of the slaughterers, executioners, i.e., captain of the guard)."
Bereshis,38,1,"And it came to pass at that time, that Yehudah went down from his achim, and turned in to an ish Adullami shmo Chirah."
Bereshis,38,2,"And Yehudah saw there a bat ish Kena'ani shmo Shua; and he took her, and went in unto her."
Bereshis,38,3,"She conceived, and bore ben; and he called shmo Er."
Bereshis,38,4,"And she conceived again, and bore ben; and she called shmo Onan."
Bereshis,38,5,"And she yet again conceived, and bore ben; and called shmo Shelah; at Keziv, when she bore him."
Bereshis,38,6,"And Yehudah took a wife for Er his bechor, whose shem was Tamar."
Bereshis,38,7,"And Er, bechor Yehudah, was rah in the eyes of Hashem ; and Hashem slaughtered him."
Bereshis,38,8,"And Yehudah said unto Onan, Go in unto eshet achicha, and enter into levirate marriage with her, and raise up zera to achicha."
Bereshis,38,9,"And Onan knew that the zera should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto eshet achiv, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give zera to achiv."
Bereshis,38,10,And the thing which he did was rah in the eyes of Hashem ; therefore He slaughtered him also.
Bereshis,38,11,"Then said Yehudah to Tamar his kallah, Remain an almanah at thy bais avi, till Shelah beni is grown; for he said, Lest he die also, as his achim did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her bais avi."
Bereshis,38,12,"And in process of time the bat Shua, eshet Yehudah, died; and Yehudah was consoled, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnah, he and his re'a Chirah the Adullami."
Bereshis,38,13,"And it was told Tamar, saying, Hinei, thy kham (father-in-law) goeth up to Timnah to shear his tzon."
Bereshis,38,14,"And she put off her widowʼs garments from her, and covered her with a tze'if (veil) , and disguised herself, and sat at the crossroads which is on the derech to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him as isha."
Bereshis,38,15,"When Yehudah saw her, he thought her to be a zonah; because she had covered her face."
Bereshis,38,16,"And he turned unto her by the derech, and said, Come now, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his kallah [daughter-in-law]) . And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?"
Bereshis,38,17,"And he said, I will send thee a gedi izzim (kid of the goats) . And she said, Wilt thou give me an eravon (pledge) , till thou send it?"
Bereshis,38,18,"And he said, What eravon shall I give thee? And she said, Thy chotam (signet) , and thy [signet neck] cord, and thy staff that is in thine yad. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him."
Bereshis,38,19,"And she arose, and went away, and took off her tze'if from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood."
Bereshis,38,20,"And Yehudah sent the gedi izzim by the yad of his friend the Adullami, to get back his eravon from the yad haisha; but he found her not."
Bereshis,38,21,"Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the kedesha (cult prostitute) that was on the crossroads by the derech? And they said, There was no kedesha in this place."
Bereshis,38,22,"And he returned to Yehudah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said that there was no kedesha in this place."
Bereshis,38,23,"And Yehudah said, Let her take for herself, lest we become buz (laughingstock) ; hinei, I sent this gedi, and thou hast not found her."
Bereshis,38,24,"And it came to pass about shlosh chadashim (three months) later, that it was told Yehudah saying, Tamar thy kallah hath played the zonah; and also, hinei, she is with child by zenunim (whoredom) . And Yehudah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burned."
Bereshis,38,25,"When she was brought forth, she sent to her kham (father-in-law) , saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child; and she said, Discern, now, whose are these, the chotam (signet) , and the [signet neck] cord, and the staff."
Bereshis,38,26,"And Yehudah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more tzadekah than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah beni. And he knew her again no more."
Bereshis,38,27,"And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, hinei te'omim (twin boys) were in her beten."
Bereshis,38,28,"And it came to pass, when she travailed in labor, that the one put out his yad; and the midwife took and bound upon his yad a scarlet thread, saying, This came out rishonah (first)."
Bereshis,38,29,"And it came to pass, as he drew back his yad, that, hinei, his brother came out; and she said, How hast paratzta (thou broken out) ? This paretz (breach, breaking) be upon thee; therefore shmo was called Peretz [Breaking out]."
Bereshis,38,30,"And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his yad; and shmo was called Zerach."
Bereshis,39,1,"And Yosef was brought down to Mitzrayim; and Potiphar, a saris Pharaoh, Sar Hatabachim (captain of the bodyguard) , a Mitzri, bought him of the hands of the Yishm'elim, which had brought him down to there."
Bereshis,39,2,"And Hashem was with Yosef, and he was an ish matzliach (a man [G-d] makes prosper) ; and he was in the bais adonav haMitzri."
Bereshis,39,3,"And adonav saw that Hashem was with him, and that Hashem caused all that he did matzliach in his yad."
Bereshis,39,4,"And Yosef found chen in his eyes, and he ministered to him; and he made him mefake'ach (overseer) over his bais, and all that he had he entrusted into his yad."
Bereshis,39,5,"And it came to pass from the time that he had made him mefake'ach (overseer) in his bais, and over all that he had, that Hashem put a brocha on the bais haMitzri on account of Yosef; and the birkat Hashem was upon all that he had in the bais, and in the sadeh."
Bereshis,39,6,"And he left all that he had in the yad Yosef; and he knew not ought he had, save the lechem which he did eat. And Yosef was yafeh to'ar (well built) and yafeh mareh (good looking)."
Bereshis,39,7,"And it came to pass after these things, that eshet adonav cast her eyes upon Yosef; and she said, Lie with me."
Bereshis,39,8,"But he refused, and said unto eshet adonav, Look, with me [here], adoni knows not what is in the bais, and he hath entrusted all that he hath to my yad;"
Bereshis,39,9,"There is none gadol in this bais than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me except thee only, because thou art his isha; how then can I do hara'ah hagedolah hazot, and commit chattat against Elohim?"
Bereshis,39,10,"And it came to pass, as she spoke to Yosef yom yom, that he unto her lo shama (did not pay heed) , to lie with her, or to be with her."
Bereshis,39,11,"And it came to pass about this time, that Yosef went into the bais to do his melachah (work) ; and there was none of the anshei habayit there within."
Bereshis,39,12,"And she caught him by his beged, saying, Lie with me; and he left his beged in her yad, and fled, and ran outside."
Bereshis,39,13,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his beged in her yad, and had fled outside,"
Bereshis,39,14,"That she called unto her anshei habayit, and spoke unto them, saying, Look, he hath brought in unto us an ish Ivri to show disrespect and mock us. He came in unto me to lie with me, and I screamed with a kol gadol (loud voice);"
Bereshis,39,15,"And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and screamed, that he left his beged with me, and fled, and ran outside."
Bereshis,39,16,"And she laid up his beged by her, until adonav came to his bais."
Bereshis,39,17,"And she spoke unto him according to these words, saying, The eved HaIvri, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to show disrespect and mock me;"
Bereshis,39,18,"And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and screamed, that he left his beged with me, and fled outside."
Bereshis,39,19,"And it came to pass, when adonav heard the words of his isha, which she spoke unto him, saying, After this manner did thy eved to me; that his wrath was kindled."
Bereshis,39,20,"And adonei Yosef took him, and put him into the bais hasohar, a place where the asirei HaMelech were prisoners; and he was there in the bais hasohar."
Bereshis,39,21,"But Hashem was with Yosef, and showed him chesed, and gave him chen in the eyes of the sar bais hasohar."
Bereshis,39,22,"And the sar bais hasohar entrusted to the yad Yosef all the asirim (prisoners) that were in the bais hasohar; and whatsoever they did there, he was the accomplisher of it."
Bereshis,39,23,"The sar bais hasohar looked not to anything that was under his [Yosefʼs] yad; because Hashem was with him, and that which he did, Hashem made it to prosper."
Bereshis,40,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that the mashkeh (cupbearer) Melech Mitzrayim and his ofeh (baker) had offended adoneihem Melech Mitzrayim."
Bereshis,40,2,"And Pharaoh was in wrath against two of his sarisim, against the sar hamashkim, and against the sar ha'ofim."
Bereshis,40,3,"And he put them b'mishmar (under watch, in custody) in the bais sar hatabachim (house of the captain of the bodyguards) , in the bais hasohar, in the makom (place) where Yosef was incarcerated."
Bereshis,40,4,"And the sar hatabachim charged Yosef with them, and he ministered to them; and they continued a season b'mishmar (in custody, under watch)."
Bereshis,40,5,"And they dreamed a chalom both of them, each man his chalom in lailah echad (in one night, the same night) , and each chalom with its own pitron (meaning, interpretation) , the mashkeh and the ofeh of Melech Mitzrayim, which were prisoners in the bais hasohar."
Bereshis,40,6,"And Yosef came in unto them in the boker, and looked upon them, and, hinei, they were zo'afim (troubled ones, sad ones)."
Bereshis,40,7,"And he asked the sarisim of Pharaoh that were with him b'mishmar (in the custody ward) of bais adonav, saying, Why look ye so ra'im (bad, downcast ones) hayom (today)?"
Bereshis,40,8,"And they said unto him, We have dreamed a chalom, and there is no poter (interpreter) of it. And Yosef said unto them, Do not pitronim (interpretations) belong to Elohim? Tell now to me."
Bereshis,40,9,"And the sar hamashkim told his chalom to Yosef, and said to him, In my chalom, hinei, a gefen was before me;"
Bereshis,40,10,"And in the gefen were shloshah sarigim (three branches) ; and it was as soon as it budded, its blossom shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth anavim (ripe grapes);"
Bereshis,40,11,"And the kos Pharaoh was in my yad; and I took the anavim (grapes) , and pressed them into kos Pharaoh, and I put the kos into the palm of Pharaoh."
Bereshis,40,12,"And Yosef said unto him, This is the pitron (interpretation) of it; The shloshet hasarigim are shloshet yamim."
Bereshis,40,13,"Within shloshet yamim shall Pharaoh lift up thine rosh, and restore thee unto thy ken (place, post) ; and thou shalt deliver kos Pharaoh into his yad, after the mishpat harishon (former practice) when thou wast his mashkeh."
Bereshis,40,14,"But remember me when it shall be well with thee, and show chesed now unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this bais;"
Bereshis,40,15,For indeed I was stolen away out of the Eretz HaIvrim; and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the bor (dungeon).
Bereshis,40,16,"When the sar ha'ofim saw that he had done the pitron well, he said unto Yosef, I also was in my chalom, and, hinei, I had shloshah salei chori (three baskets of cakes) on my rosh;"
Bereshis,40,17,And in the sal haelyon (uppermost basket) there was all manner of food for Pharaoh; and ha'oph (the birds) did eat them out of the sal (basket) upon my rosh.
Bereshis,40,18,"And Yosef answered and said, This is the pitron (interpretation, meaning) thereof: The shloshet hasalim (three baskets) are shloshet yamim."
Bereshis,40,19,"Yet within shloshet yamim shall Pharaoh lift off thy rosh from on thee, and shall hang thee on an etz; and ha'oph (the birds) shall eat thy basar from off thee."
Bereshis,40,20,"And it came to pass on Yom HaShlishi, which was the yom huledet of Pharaoh, that he made a mishteh (feast) unto all his avadim; and he lifted up the rosh sar hamashkim and the rosh sar ha'ofim (head of the chief baker) in the midst of his avadim (officials)."
Bereshis,40,21,He restored the sar hamashkim unto his mashkeh; and he gave the kos into the palm of Pharaoh;
Bereshis,40,22,But he hanged the sar ha'ofim: just as Yosef had made the pitron to them.
Bereshis,40,23,Yet did not the sar hamashkim remember Yosef but forgot him.
Bereshis,41,1,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed a chalom: and, hinei, he stood by haye'or (the River, i.e., the Nile)."
Bereshis,41,2,"And, hinei, there came up out of haye'or (the River, i.e., the Nile) seven cows, fine in appearance and fat in basar; and they grazed on the riverbank."
Bereshis,41,3,"And, hinei, seven other cows came up after them out of the Nile, ra'ot mareh (ugly in appearance) and dakot basar (gaunt ones in flesh, lean-fleshed) ; and stood by the other cows upon the bank of the Nile."
Bereshis,41,4,And the cows that were ra'ot hamareh and that were dakot habasar did devour the seven cows that were fine in appearance and fat. Then Pharaoh awoke.
Bereshis,41,5,"And he slept and dreamed a chalom the second time; and, hinei, sheva heads of grain came up upon one stalk, beri'ot (fat ones) and tovot."
Bereshis,41,6,"And, hinei, seven thin heads of grain scorched by the east wind tzomechot (sprung up) after them."
Bereshis,41,7,"And the seven thin heads of grain devoured the seven fat and mele'ot (full) heads of grain. And Pharaoh awoke; and, hinei, it was a chalom!"
Bereshis,41,8,"And it came to pass in the boker that his ruach was troubled; and he sent and called for all the chartummei Mitzrayim (magicians of Egypt) , and all the chachamim thereof; and Pharaoh told them his chalom; but there was no poter (interpreter) for Pharaoh."
Bereshis,41,9,"Then the sar hamashkim spoke unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day."
Bereshis,41,10,"Pharaoh was in wrath with his avadim, and put me b'mishmar (in custody) in the bais sar hatabbachim, both me and the sar ha'ofim;"
Bereshis,41,11,"And we dreamed a chalom in the same lailah, I and he; and each chalom we dreamed had its own pitron (interpretation)."
Bereshis,41,12,"And there was there with us a na'ar Ivri, eved to the sar hatabbachim; and we told him, and he interpreted to us chalomoteinu (our dreams) ; to each according to his chalom he did interpret."
Bereshis,41,13,"And it was, just as he interpreted to us, so it came to pass; me he restored unto mine ken (post) , and him he hanged."
Bereshis,41,14,"Then Pharaoh sent and summoned Yosef, and they brought him hastily out of the bor (dungeon) ; and he shaved, and changed his clothes, and came in unto Pharaoh."
Bereshis,41,15,"And Pharaoh said unto Yosef, I have dreamed a chalom, and there is no poter (interpreter) for it; and I have heard it said of thee, that thou canst understand a chalom to interpret it."
Bereshis,41,16,"And Yosef answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me; Elohim shall give Pharaoh an answer of shalom."
Bereshis,41,17,"And Pharaoh said unto Yosef, In my chalom, hineni, I stood upon the bank of the Nile;"
Bereshis,41,18,"And, hinei, there came up out of the Nile seven cows beri'ot basar (fat in body) and sleek of form; and they grazed by the riverbank."
Bereshis,41,19,"And, hinei, seven other cows came up after them, dalot (poor, scrawny, thin) and ra'ot to'ar me'od (very ugly in appearance) and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in kol Eretz Mitzrayim, unacceptably bad;"
Bereshis,41,20,And the lean and the ra'ot cows did eat up the first seven fat cows;
Bereshis,41,21,"And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still rah in appearance, as at the beginning. So I awoke."
Bereshis,41,22,"And I saw in my chalom, and, hinei, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, mele'ot (full) and tovot (good);"
Bereshis,41,23,"And, hinei, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and scorched with the east wind, tzomechot (sprung up) after them;"
Bereshis,41,24,And the thin heads of grain devoured the seven tov heads of grain; and I told this unto the chartummim (magicians) ; but there was none that could explain it to me.
Bereshis,41,25,"And Yosef said unto Pharaoh, The chalom of Pharaoh is echad: HaElohim hath revealed to Pharaoh what He is about to do."
Bereshis,41,26,The seven good cows are seven shanim; and the seven good heads of grain are seven shanim. The chalom is echad.
Bereshis,41,27,And the seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are sheva shanim; and the seven empty heads of grain scorched by the east wind are sheva shnei ra'av (seven years of famine).
Bereshis,41,28,This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh; What HaElohim is about to do He showeth unto Pharaoh.
Bereshis,41,29,"Hinei, there come sheva shanim of sava gadol (great fullness, plenty, abundance) throughout kol Eretz Mitzrayim."
Bereshis,41,30,And there shall arise after them sheva shnei ra'av (seven years of famine) and kol hasava (all abundance) shall be forgotten in Eretz Mitzrayim; and the ra'av (famine) shall consume the land;
Bereshis,41,31,And the sava shall not be known in the land by reason of that ra'av (famine) following; for it shall be kaved me'od (very grievous).
Bereshis,41,32,"And for that the chalom was doubled unto Pharaoh; it is because the thing is [decidedly] established by HaElohim, and HaElohim will shortly bring it to pass."
Bereshis,41,33,Now therefore let Pharaoh select an ish navon and chochom (a man discerning and wise) and set him over Eretz Mitzrayim.
Bereshis,41,34,"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint pekidim (officers, overseers, commissioners) over the land, and take up the fifth part [of the harvest] of Eretz Mitzrayim in the sheva shnei hasava."
Bereshis,41,35,"And let them gather kol ochel of those shanim hatovot that come, and store up grain under the yad Pharaoh, and let them be shomer over ochel in the cities."
Bereshis,41,36,"And that ochel shall be for reserves for the land against the sheva shnei hara'av, which shall be in Eretz Mitzrayim; that the land perish not through the ra'av."
Bereshis,41,37,"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his avadim."
Bereshis,41,38,"And Pharaoh said unto his avadim, Can we find such an ish as this is, an ish in whom is the Ruach Elohim?"
Bereshis,41,39,"And Pharaoh said unto Yosef, Forasmuch as Elohim hath showed thee all this, there is none so navon (discerning) and chochom (wise) as thou art;"
Bereshis,41,40,"Thou shalt be over my bais (palace) , and according unto thy mouth shall all my people order themselves; only with respect to the kisse will I be greater than thou."
Bereshis,41,41,"And Pharaoh said unto Yosef, See, I have set thee over kol Eretz Mitzrayim."
Bereshis,41,42,"And Pharaoh took off his taba'at (signet ring) from his yad, and put it upon yad Yosef, and arrayed him in garments of fine linen, and put a chain of zahav around his neck;"
Bereshis,41,43,"And he made him to ride in the second merkavah which he had; and they cried before him, Avrech! And he put him over kol Eretz Mitzrayim."
Bereshis,41,44,"And Pharaoh said unto Yosef, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his yad or regel in kol Eretz Mitzrayim."
Bereshis,41,45,And Pharaoh called shem Yosef Tzaphnat Pa'neach; and he gave him as isha Asenat Bat Poti Phera kohen of On. And Yosef went out over all Eretz Mitzrayim.
Bereshis,41,46,"And Yosef was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim. And Yosef went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout kol Eretz Mitzrayim."
Bereshis,41,47,And in the sheva shnei hasava the land brought forth by handfuls.
Bereshis,41,48,"And he gathered up kol ochel of the sheva shanim, which were in Eretz Mitzrayim, and laid up the ochel in the cities; the ochel of the sadeh, which surrounded every city, laid he up in the same."
Bereshis,41,49,"And Yosef gathered grain as the chol (sand) of the yam, very much, until he stopped counting; for it was without mispar (number)."
Bereshis,41,50,"And unto Yosef were born two banim before the shnat ra'av came, which Asenat Bat Poti Phera kohen of On bore unto him."
Bereshis,41,51,"And Yosef called the shem of the bechor Menasheh: For Elohim, said he nashani, (hath made me forget) all my amal, and kol bais Avi."
Bereshis,41,52,And the shem of the second called he Ephrayim: For Elohim hifrani (hath caused me to be fruitful) in the eretz of my oni (suffering).
Bereshis,41,53,And the sheva shnei hasava that was in Eretz Mitzrayim were ended.
Bereshis,41,54,"And the sheva shnei hara'av began to come, just as Yosef had said; and the ra'av was in all lands; but in kol Eretz Mitzrayim there was lechem."
Bereshis,41,55,"And when kol Eretz Mitzrayim was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for lechem; and Pharaoh said unto kol Mitzrayim, Go unto Yosef; what he saith to you, do."
Bereshis,41,56,"And the ra'av (famine) was over kol pnei ha'aretz; and Yosef opened all that was in them, and sold unto the Mitzrayim; and the ra'av (famine) became severe in Eretz Mitzrayim."
Bereshis,41,57,And kol HaAretz (all the world) came into Mitzrayim to Yosef to buy grain; because that the ra'av (famine) was so chazak in kol HaAretz.
Bereshis,42,1,"Now when Ya'akov saw that there was shever (grain) in Mitzrayim, Ya'akov said unto his banim, Why do ye look one upon another?"
Bereshis,42,2,"And he said, Hinei, I have heard that there is shever (grain) in Mitzrayim; get you down to there, and buy for us from there; that we may live, and not die."
Bereshis,42,3,Achei Yosef asarah (Yosefʼs ten brothers) then went down to buy grain in Mitzrayim.
Bereshis,42,4,"But Binyamin, achi Yosef, Ya'akov sent not with his achim; for he said, Lest ason (evil, harm) befall him."
Bereshis,42,5,And the Bnei Yisroel came to make purchase among those that were coming; for the ra'av (famine) was in Eretz Kena'an.
Bereshis,42,6,"And Yosef was the Shalit Al HaAretz, and he it was that sold to kol Am HaAretz: and Achei Yosef came, and prostrated themselves before him with their faces to the ground."
Bereshis,42,7,"And Yosef saw his achim, and he recognized them, but made himself a stranger unto them, and spoke roughly unto them; and he said unto them, From where come ye? And they said, From Eretz Kena'an to buy ochel."
Bereshis,42,8,"And Yosef recognized his achim, but they recognized not him."
Bereshis,42,9,"And Yosef remembered the chalomot which he dreamed about them, and said unto them, Ye are meragelim (spies) ; to see the ervat ha'aretz (nakedness of the land) ye came."
Bereshis,42,10,"And they said unto him, Lo, adoni, but to buy okhel are thy avadim come."
Bereshis,42,11,"We are all bnei ish echad; we are truthful ones, thy avadim are no meragelim."
Bereshis,42,12,"And he said unto them, Lo, but to see the ervat ha'aretz ye came."
Bereshis,42,13,"And they said, Thy avadim are Shneym Asar Achim, the bnei ish echad in Eretz Kena'an; and, hinei, the katon is today with Avinu, and one is not."
Bereshis,42,14,"And Yosef said unto them, That is it just as I spoke unto you, Ye are meragelim;"
Bereshis,42,15,"Hereby ye shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth from here, except achichem hakaton (your youngest brother) come here."
Bereshis,42,16,"Send one of you, and let him bring back achichem, and ye shall be kept prisoner, that your words may be tested, whether there be any emes in you; or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are meragelim (spies)."
Bereshis,42,17,And he put them all together el-mishmar (in custody) shloshet yamim.
Bereshis,42,18,"And Yosef said unto them on the Yom HaShlishi, This do, and live; for I fear HaElohim:"
Bereshis,42,19,"If ye be truthful ones, let one of your achim be bound in your bais mishmar; go ye, carry grain for the ra'avon (famine of) bateichem (your house);"
Bereshis,42,20,"But bring achichem hakaton unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so."
Bereshis,42,21,"And they said one to another, Surely we are ashemim (guilty ones) because of achinu (our brother) , in that we saw the tzoros of his nefesh, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this tzoros come upon us."
Bereshis,42,22,"And Reuven answered them, saying, Spoke I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the yeled; and ye would not hear? Therefore, hinei, the accounting for his dahm is required [of us]."
Bereshis,42,23,"And they had no da'as that Yosef understood them; for he spoke unto them by the melitz (go-between, interpreter)."
Bereshis,42,24,"And he turned himself away from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and spoke with them, and took from them Shim'on, and bound him before their eyes."
Bereshis,42,25,"Then Yosef commanded to fill their kelim with grain, and to restore every manʼs kesef into his sack, and to give them provision for the derech; and thus did he unto them."
Bereshis,42,26,"And they loaded their chamorim with the grain, and departed from there."
Bereshis,42,27,"And as one of them opened his sack to get feed for his chamor in the malon (inn) , he saw his kesef; for, hinei, it was in the mouth of his sack."
Bereshis,42,28,"And he said unto his achim, My kesef is restored; and, hinei, it is even in my sack; and their lev failed them, and they shook with fear, saying one to another, What is this that Elohim hath done unto us?"
Bereshis,42,29,"And they came unto Ya'akov Avihem in Eretz Kena'an, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,"
Bereshis,42,30,"The ish, who is adonei HaAretz, spoke roughly to us, and took us for meragelim HaAretz."
Bereshis,42,31,"And we said unto him, We are truthful ones; we are no meragelim;"
Bereshis,42,32,"We are Shneym Asar Achim, Bnei Avinu; one is not, and the katon is today with Avinu in Eretz Kena'an."
Bereshis,42,33,"And the ish, adonei HaAretz, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are truthful ones; leave one of your achim here with me, and that which is needful for the ra'avon bateichem (famine of your houses) , take and be gone;"
Bereshis,42,34,"And bring achichem hakaton unto me; then shall I know that ye are not meragelim, but that ye are truthful ones: so will I restore you achichem, and ye shall freely trade in the land."
Bereshis,42,35,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, hinei, every manʼs pouch of kesef was in his sack; and when both they and Avihem saw the pouches of kesef, they were afraid."
Bereshis,42,36,"And Ya'akov Avihem said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children; Yosef is not, and Shim'on is not, and ye will take Binyamin away; all these things are against me."
Bereshis,42,37,"And Reuven spoke unto Aviv, saying, Slay my two banim, if I bring him not to thee; entrust him into my yad, and I will bring him to thee again."
Bereshis,42,38,"And he said, Beni (my son) shall not go down with you; for achiv is dead, and he is left alone; if ason (harm, evil) befall him on the derech in which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hair in yagon (sorrow) to Sheol."
Bereshis,43,1,"And the ra'av (famine) was kaved (heavy, severe) in the land."
Bereshis,43,2,"And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the shever (grain) which they had brought out of Mitzrayim, then Avihem said unto them, Shuvu (return) ! Buy for us a little ochel."
Bereshis,43,3,"And Yehudah spoke unto him, saying, The ish did solemnly warn us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, unless achichem be with you."
Bereshis,43,4,"If thou wilt send achinu (our brother) with us, we will go down and buy thee ochel;"
Bereshis,43,5,"But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down; for the ish said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, unless achichem be with you."
Bereshis,43,6,"And Yisroel said, Why dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the ish whether ye had yet another ach (brother)?"
Bereshis,43,7,"And they said, The ish asked in detail about us and about our moledet (kindred) , saying, Is Avichem yet alive? Have ye another ach? And we declared to him according to these words of [his inquiry]; could we certainly know that he would say, Bring down achichem?"
Bereshis,43,8,"And Yehudah said unto Yisroel Aviv, Send na'ar with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones."
Bereshis,43,9,"I will be surety for him; of my yad shalt thou require an accounting for him; if I bring him not back unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame kol hayamim;"
Bereshis,43,10,"For if we had not delayed, surely now we had returned zeh pa'amayim (this second time)."
Bereshis,43,11,"And Yisroel Avihem said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of mizimerat HaAretz (the best fruits of the land) in your kelim (vessels) , and carry down to the ish a minchah (present) , a little balm, and a little devash (honey) , nekhot (spices) , loht (myrrh) , batenim (pistachio nuts) , and shekedim (almonds):"
Bereshis,43,12,"And take kesef mishneh (double money) in your yad; and the kesef that was returned in the mouth of your sacks, carry it back in your yad; perhaps it was mishgeh (mistake);"
Bereshis,43,13,"Take also achichem, and arise, shuvu (return) unto the ish;"
Bereshis,43,14,"And El Shaddai give you rachamim before the ish, that he may send away achichem acher (your other brother) , and Binyamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
Bereshis,43,15,"And the anashim took that minchah, and they took mishneh kesef (double money) in their yad and Binyamin; and rose up, and went down to Mitzrayim, and stood before Yosef."
Bereshis,43,16,"And when Yosef saw Binyamin with them, he said to the ish over Bais Yosef, Bring these anashim home, and slaughter the tevach, and make ready; for these anashim shall dine with me at tzahorayim (noon)."
Bereshis,43,17,And the ish did as Yosef said; and the ish brought the anashim to the house of Yosef.
Bereshis,43,18,"And the anashim were afraid, because they were brought into Bais Yosef; and they said, Because of the kesef that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and seize us for avadim, and chamoreinu (our donkeys)."
Bereshis,43,19,"And they came near to the ish over Bais Yosef, and they spoke with him at the petach habayit,"
Bereshis,43,20,"And said, O adoni, we came indeed down at the first time to buy ochel:"
Bereshis,43,21,"And it came to pass, when we came to the malon, that we opened our sacks, and, hinei, kesef ish (every manʼs money) was in the mouth of his sack, our kesef in full weight; and we have brought it back again in our yad."
Bereshis,43,22,And kesef acher (other money) have we brought down in our hands to buy ochel; we cannot tell who put our kesef in our sacks.
Bereshis,43,23,"And he said, Shalom lachem, fear not; Eloheichem, and Elohei Avichem, hath given you matmon (treasure) in your sacks; I had your kesef. And he brought Shim'on out unto them."
Bereshis,43,24,"And the ish brought the anashim into the house of Yosef, and gave them mayim, and they washed their raglayim; and he gave their chamorim mispo (fodder)."
Bereshis,43,25,And they made ready the minchah for bo Yosef (coming of Yosef) at tzahorayim; for they heard that they would eat lechem there.
Bereshis,43,26,"And when Yosef came home, they presented him the minchah which was in their yad in the house, and prostrated themselves to the ground before him."
Bereshis,43,27,"And he asked them l'shalom (about their welfare) , and said, Is there shalom with avichem, the zaken of whom ye spoke? Is he still alive?"
Bereshis,43,28,"And they answered, There is shalom with thy eved avinu; he is still alive. And they bowed their heads, and prostrated themselves."
Bereshis,43,29,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw achiv Binyamin, ben immo, and said, Is this achichem hakaton (your younger brother) , of whom ye spoke unto me? And he said, Elohim be gracious unto thee, beni."
Bereshis,43,30,"And Yosef made haste; for his compassion was stirred upon achiv (his brother) ; and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his cheder, and wept there."
Bereshis,43,31,"And he washed his face, and went out, and controlled himself, and said, Serve lechem."
Bereshis,43,32,"And they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Mitzrim (Egyptians) , which did eat with him, by themselves; because Mitzrim could not eat lechem with the Ivrim; for that is a to'evah (abomination) unto the Mitzrim."
Bereshis,43,33,"And they sat before him, the bechor according to his bechorah (birthright) , and the youngest according to his youth; and the anashim marvelled one with another."
Bereshis,43,34,"And he took and sent masot (portions) unto them from before him; but masat Binyamin was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank, and feasted with him."
Bereshis,44,1,"And he commanded the ish over Bais Yosef, saying, Fill the sacks of the anashim with ochel, as much as they can carry, and put kesef ish in the mouth of his sack."
Bereshis,44,2,"And put my cup, gevi'a hakesef (cup of silver) , in the mouth of the sack of the katon, and his kesef for shever (grain) . And he did according to the davar Yosef had spoken."
Bereshis,44,3,"As soon as the boker ohr, the anashim were sent away, they and their chamorim."
Bereshis,44,4,"And when they were gone out of the ir, and not yet far off, Yosef said unto the ish over Bais Yosef, Up, follow after the anashim; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded ra'ah for tovah?"
Bereshis,44,5,"Is not this it in which adoni drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? Ye have done ra'ah in so doing."
Bereshis,44,6,"And he overtook them, and he spoke unto them these same devarim."
Bereshis,44,7,"And they said unto him, Wherefore saith adoni these words? Chalilah (far be it) that thy avadim should do according to this thing;"
Bereshis,44,8,"Hinei, the kesef, which we found in the mouth of our sacks, we brought back unto thee out of Eretz Kena'an; how then should we be ganavim stealing kesef or zahav out of the bais adoneicha?"
Bereshis,44,9,"With whomsoever of thy avadim it be found, both let him die, and we also will be avadim of adoni."
Bereshis,44,10,"And he said, Now also let it be according unto your devarim; he with whom it is found shall be to me eved; and ye shall be nekiyim (blameless)."
Bereshis,44,11,"Then they speedily took down every ish his sack to the ground, and opened every ish his sack."
Bereshis,44,12,"And he searched, and began at the gadol (eldest) , and ended at the katon (youngest) ; and the gevi'a (cup, goblet) was found in the sack of Binyamin."
Bereshis,44,13,"Then they tore their garments, and loaded every ish his chamor, and returned to the ir."
Bereshis,44,14,And Yehudah and his achim came to Bais Yosef; for he was yet there; and they fell before him on the ground.
Bereshis,44,15,"And Yosef said unto them, What ma'aseh (deed) is this that ye have done? Know ye not that an ish like me can find things out as a menachesh (diviner)?"
Bereshis,44,16,"And Yehudah said, What shall we say unto adoni? What shall we speak? Or how shall we clear ourselves? HaElohim hath found out the avon (iniquity) of thy avadim; look at us, we are now avadim la'adoni, both we, and he also with whom the gevi'a (cup) is found."
Bereshis,44,17,"And he [Yosef] said, Chalilah that I should do so; but the ish in whose yad the gevi'a is found, he shall be to me eved; and as for you, go back in shalom unto avichem."
Bereshis,44,18,"Then Yehudah came near unto him, and said, Oh, adoni, let thy eved speak now a davar in oznei adoni, and let not thine anger burn against thy eved; for thou art even like Pharaoh."
Bereshis,44,19,"Adoni asked his avadim, saying, Have ye an av, or an ach?"
Bereshis,44,20,"And we said unto adoni, We have an av, a zaken, and a yeled zekunim katan (child of his old age, a little one) ; and achiv is dead, and he alone is left of immo, and aviv loveth him."
Bereshis,44,21,"And thou saidst unto thy avadim, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him."
Bereshis,44,22,"And we said unto adoni, The na'ar cannot leave aviv; for if he should leave aviv, aviv would die."
Bereshis,44,23,"And thou saidst unto thy avadim, Except achichem hakaton (your youngest brother) come down with you, ye shall see my face no more."
Bereshis,44,24,And it came to pass when we came up unto thy eved Avi we told him the divrei adoni.
Bereshis,44,25,"And avinu said, Shuvu, (go back, return) and buy us a little ochel."
Bereshis,44,26,"And we said, We cannot go down; if achinu hakaton (our youngest brother) be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the face of HaIsh, except achinu hakaton be with us."
Bereshis,44,27,"And thy eved Avi said unto us, Ye know that my wife bore me two banim;"
Bereshis,44,28,"And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn to pieces; and I saw him not ad-hennah (until now);"
Bereshis,44,29,"And if ye take this also from me, and ason (evil, harm) befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hair in ra'ah (misery) to Sheol."
Bereshis,44,30,"Now therefore when I come to thy eved Avi, and the na'ar be not with us; seeing that his nefesh is bound up in the nefesh of the na'ar;"
Bereshis,44,31,"It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the na'ar is not with us, that he will die; and thy avadim shall bring down the gray hair of thy eved avinu with yagon (sorrow) to Sheol,"
Bereshis,44,32,"For thy eved became surety for the na'ar unto Avi, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame before Avi kol hayamim."
Bereshis,44,33,"Therefore, let thy eved, now, abide instead of the na'ar, an eved to adoni; and let the na'ar go up with his achim."
Bereshis,44,34,"For how shall I go up to Avi, and the na'ar be not with me? Lest I see the rah that would overtake Avi."
Bereshis,45,1,"Then Yosef could not control himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause kol ish to go out from me. And there stood no ish with him, while Yosef made himself known unto his achim."
Bereshis,45,2,And he wept aloud; and the Mitzrayim and the Bais Pharaoh heard.
Bereshis,45,3,"And Yosef said unto his achim (brethren) , I am Yosef; doth Avi yet live? And his achim could not answer him; for they were shocked with dismay at his presence."
Bereshis,45,4,"And Yosef said unto his achim, Come near to me, now. And they came near. And he said, I am Yosef achichem (your brother) , whom ye sold into Mitzrayim."
Bereshis,45,5,"Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me here; for Elohim did send me before you to save life."
Bereshis,45,6,"For these two years hath the ra'av (famine) been in the land; and yet there are chamesh shanim (five years) , in the which there shall neither be plowing nor harvest."
Bereshis,45,7,"And Elohim sent me before you to save you a she'erit (remnant) in the earth, and to save life for you by a peletah gedolah (great deliverance, escape)."
Bereshis,45,8,"So now it was not you that sent me here, but HaElohim; and He hath made me as an Av to Pharaoh, and adon of all his Bais, and Moshel throughout kol Eretz Mitzrayim."
Bereshis,45,9,"Haste ye, and go up to Avi, and say unto him, Thus saith thy ben, Yosef, Elohim hath made me as adon kol Mitzrayim; come down unto me, tarry not;"
Bereshis,45,10,"And thou shalt dwell in Eretz Goshen, and thou shalt be karov (near) unto me, thou, and thy banim, and thy bnei banecha, and thy tzon, and thy bakar, and all that thou hast:"
Bereshis,45,11,"And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are chamesh shanim of ra'av (famine) ; lest thou, and thy bais, and all that thou hast, come to destitution."
Bereshis,45,12,"And, hinei, your eyes see, and the eyes of achi Binyamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you."
Bereshis,45,13,"And ye shall tell Avi of kol my kavod b'Mitzrayim, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down Avi here."
Bereshis,45,14,"And he fell upon the neck of Binyamin achiv, and wept; and Binyamin wept upon his neck."
Bereshis,45,15,"Moreover he kissed all his achim, and wept upon them; and after that his achim talked with him."
Bereshis,45,16,"And the news thereof was heard in Bais Pharaoh saying, Achei Yosef are come; and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his avadim."
Bereshis,45,17,"And Pharaoh said unto Yosef, Say unto thy achim, This do ye; load your beasts, and go, get you unto Eretz Kena'an;"
Bereshis,45,18,"And take Avichem and your households, and come unto me; and I will give you the best of Eretz Mitzrayim, ye shall eat the chelev haaretz."
Bereshis,45,19,"Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you agalot (wagons) out of Eretz Mitzrayim for your little ones, and for your nashim, and bring Avichem, and come."
Bereshis,45,20,Also regard not your kelim; for the best of kol Eretz Mitzrayim is yours.
Bereshis,45,21,"And the Bnei Yisroel did so; and Yosef gave them agalot, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the derech."
Bereshis,45,22,"To all of them he gave each man chalifot semalot; but to Binyamin he gave three hundred pieces of kesef, and chamesh chalifot semalot."
Bereshis,45,23,"And to Aviv he sent after this manner; ten chamorim loaded with the best of Mitzrayim, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and lechem and provision for Aviv for the derech."
Bereshis,45,24,"So he sent his achim away, and they departed; and he said unto them, See that ye not quarrel by the derech."
Bereshis,45,25,"And they went up out of Mitzrayim, and came into Eretz Kena'an unto Ya'akov avihem,"
Bereshis,45,26,"And told him, saying, Yosef chai! Yosef is yet alive, and he is Moshel kol Eretz Mitzrayim. And Ya'akovʼs lev fainted, for he believed them not."
Bereshis,45,27,"And they told him kol divrei Yosef, which he had said unto them; and when he saw the agalot which Yosef had sent to carry him, the ruach Ya'akov avihem revived;"
Bereshis,45,28,"And Yisroel said, It is enough; Yosef Beni chai! Yosef Beni is yet alive; I will go and see him before I die."
Bereshis,46,1,"And Yisroel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Be'er-Sheva, and offered zevakhim unto Elohei Aviv Yitzchak."
Bereshis,46,2,"And Elohim spoke unto Yisroel in the marot halailah, and said, Ya'akov, Ya'akov. And he said, Hineni."
Bereshis,46,3,"And He said, I am El Elohei Avicha; fear not to go down to Mitzrayim; for there I will make thee a Goy Gadol;"
Bereshis,46,4,I will go down with thee to Mitzrayim; and I will also surely bring thee up again; and Yosef shall put his yad upon thine eyes.
Bereshis,46,5,"And Ya'akov rose up from Be'er-Sheva; and the Bnei Yisroel carried Ya'akov Avihem, and their little ones, and their nashim, in the agalot which Pharaoh had sent to carry him."
Bereshis,46,6,"And they took their mikneh, and their possessions, which they had acquired in Eretz Kena'an, and came to Mitzrayim, Ya'akov, and all his zera with him;"
Bereshis,46,7,"His banim, and his bnei banim with him, his banot, and his banot banim, and all his zera brought he with him to Mitzrayim."
Bereshis,46,8,"And these are the shemot Bnei Yisroel, which came to Mitzrayim: Ya'akov and his banim: Reuven, bechor Ya'akov;"
Bereshis,46,9,"And the Bnei Reuven: Chanokh, and Pallu, and Chetzron, and Carmi."
Bereshis,46,10,"And the Bnei Shim'on: Yemuel, and Yamin, and Ohad, and Yachin, and Tzochar, and Sha'ul Ben HaKena'ani."
Bereshis,46,11,"And the Bnei Levi: Gershon, Kohat, and Merari."
Bereshis,46,12,"And the Bnei Yehudah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Peretz, and Zerach; but Er and Onan died in Eretz Kena'an. And the Bnei Peretz were Chetzron and Chamul."
Bereshis,46,13,"And the Bnei Yissakhar: Tola, and Puvah, and Yov, and Shimron."
Bereshis,46,14,"And the Bnei Zevulun: Sered, Elon, and Yachle'el."
Bereshis,46,15,"These are the Bnei Leah, which she bore unto Ya'akov in Paddan-Aram, with his bat Dinah; kol nefesh of his banim and his banot were thirty and three."
Bereshis,46,16,"And the Bnei Gad: Tziphyon, Chaggi, Shuni, Etzbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli."
Bereshis,46,17,"And the Bnei Asher: Yimnah, and Yishvah, and Yishvi, and Beri'ah, and Serach their achot; and the Bnei Beri'ah: Chever, and Malki'el."
Bereshis,46,18,"These are the Bnei Zilpah, whom Lavan gave to Leah his bat, and these she bore unto Ya'akov, even sixteen nefesh."
Bereshis,46,19,"The Bnei Rachel eshet Ya'akov: Yosef, and Binyamin."
Bereshis,46,20,"And unto Yosef in Eretz Mitzrayim were born Menasheh and Ephrayim, which Asenat Bat Poti Phera kohen of On bore unto him."
Bereshis,46,21,"And the Bnei Binyamin were Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Na'aman, Echi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Chuppim, and Ard."
Bereshis,46,22,"These are the Bnei Rachel, which were born to Ya'akov; kol nefesh were fourteen."
Bereshis,46,23,And the Bnei Dan: Chushim.
Bereshis,46,24,"And the Bnei Naphtali: Yachtze'el, and Guni, and Yetzer, and Shillem."
Bereshis,46,25,"These are the Bnei Bilhah, which Lavan gave unto Rachel his bat, and she bore these unto Ya'akov; kol nefesh were shivah."
Bereshis,46,26,"Kol hanefesh that came with Ya'akov to Mitzrayim, which came out of his loins, apart from the nashim of the Bnei Ya'akov, kol nefesh were threescore and six;"
Bereshis,46,27,"And the Bnei Yosef, which were born to him in Mitzrayim, were two nefesh; kol hanefesh of Bais Ya'akov, which came into Mitzrayim, were shivim (seventy)."
Bereshis,46,28,"And he sent Yehudah before him unto Yosef, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into Eretz Goshen."
Bereshis,46,29,"And Yosef made ready his merkavah, and went up to meet Yisroel Aviv, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a long time."
Bereshis,46,30,"And Yisroel said unto Yosef, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive."
Bereshis,46,31,"And Yosef said unto his achim, and unto Bais Aviv, I will go up, and speak to Pharaoh, and say unto him, My achim and Bais Avi, which were in Eretz Kena'an, are come unto me;"
Bereshis,46,32,"And the anashim are roei tzon (shepherds) , keepers of livestock; and they have brought their tzon, and their bakar, and all that they have."
Bereshis,46,33,"And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is ma'aseichem (your occupation)?"
Bereshis,46,34,"That ye shall say, Thy avadim hath been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we, and also Avoteinu; that ye may dwell in Eretz Goshen; for every ro'eh tzon is a toevat Mitzrayim."
Bereshis,47,1,"Then Yosef came and told Pharaoh, and said, Avi and my achim, and their tzon, and their bakar, and all that they have, are come out of Eretz Kena'an; and they are now in Eretz Goshen."
Bereshis,47,2,"And he took some of his achim, even five anashim, and presented them unto Pharaoh."
Bereshis,47,3,"And Pharaoh said unto his achim, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy avadim are roeh tzon, both we, and also Avoteinu."
Bereshis,47,4,"They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy avadim have no mireh (pasture) for their tzon; for the ra'av (famine) is heavy in Eretz Kena'an; now therefore, let now thy avadim dwell in Eretz Goshen."
Bereshis,47,5,"And Pharaoh spoke unto Yosef, saying, Avicha and acheicha are come unto thee;"
Bereshis,47,6,"Eretz Mitzrayim is before thee; in the best of the land make avicha and acheicha to dwell; in Eretz Goshen let them dwell; and if thou knowest any anshei chayil among them, then make them sarei mikneh (royal overseers of livestock) of mine."
Bereshis,47,7,"And Yosef brought in Ya'akov aviv, and set him before Pharaoh; and Ya'akov made on Pharaoh a brocha."
Bereshis,47,8,"And Pharaoh said unto Ya'akov, How old art thou?"
Bereshis,47,9,"And Ya'akov said unto Pharaoh, The days of the shanim of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty shanah; few and bad have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my avot in the days of their pilgrimage."
Bereshis,47,10,"And Ya'akov made a brocha on Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh."
Bereshis,47,11,"And Yosef settled aviv and his achim, and gave them an achuzzah (possession) in Eretz Mitzrayim, in the best of the land, in Eretz Ra'meses, just as Pharaoh had commanded."
Bereshis,47,12,"And Yosef provided for aviv, and his achim, and kol bais aviv, with lechem, according to the children."
Bereshis,47,13,"And there was no lechem in kol ha'aretz; for the ra'av was very heavy, so that Eretz Mitzrayim and kol Eretz Kena'an fainted by reason of the ra'av (famine)."
Bereshis,47,14,"And Yosef gathered up all the kesef that was found in the Eretz Mitzrayim, and in Eretz Kena'an, for the shever (grain) which they bought; and Yosef brought the kesef into Bais Pharaoh (Pharaohʼs palace)."
Bereshis,47,15,"And when kesef failed in Eretz Mitzrayim, and in Eretz Kena'an, kol Mitzrayim came unto Yosef, and said, Give us lechem; for why should we die in thy presence? For the kesef is gone."
Bereshis,47,16,"And Yosef said, Give your mikneh; and I will give you for your mikneh, if kesef is gone."
Bereshis,47,17,"And they brought their mikneh unto Yosef; and Yosef gave them lechem in exchange for susim, and for the tzon, and for the mikneh of the bakar, and for the chamorim; and he fed them lechem for all their mikneh for that year."
Bereshis,47,18,"When that year was ended, they came unto him the shanah hashenit, and said unto him, We will not hide it from adoni, how that our kesef is spent; adoni also hath our mikneh of behemah; there is not ought left in the sight of adoni, but geviyyatenu (our bodies) , and adematenu (our lands);"
Bereshis,47,19,"Why shall we die before thine eyes, both we and adematenu? Buy us and adematenu for lechem, and we and adematenu will be avadim unto Pharaoh; and give us zera, that we may live, and not die, that the adamah be not desolate."
Bereshis,47,20,"And Yosef bought kol Admat Mitzrayim for Pharaoh; for the Mitzrayim sold every ish his sadeh, because the ra'av (famine) was chazak over them; so the land became Pharaohʼs."
Bereshis,47,21,"And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Mitzrayim even to the other end thereof."
Bereshis,47,22,"Only the admat hakohanim bought he not; for the kohanim had a chok assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their chok which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they sold not their lands."
Bereshis,47,23,"Then Yosef said unto the people, See, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is zera for you, and ye shall sow the adamah."
Bereshis,47,24,"And it shall come to pass in the tevu'ot, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for zera of the sadeh, and for your ochel, and for them of your batim, and for food for your children."
Bereshis,47,25,"And they said, Thou hast saved our lives; let us find chen (grace, favor) in the sight of adoni, and we will be avadim to Pharaoh."
Bereshis,47,26,"And Yosef made it a chok over Eretz Mitzrayim unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the admat hakohanim only, which became not Pharaohʼs."
Bereshis,47,27,"And Yisroel settled in Eretz Mitzrayim, in Eretz Goshen; and they acquired property therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly."
Bereshis,47,28,And Ya'akov lived in Eretz Mitzrayim seventeen shanah; so the whole age of Ya'akov was a hundred forty and seven shanah.
Bereshis,47,29,"And the time drew near that Yisroel must die; and he called bno Yosef, and said unto him, If now I have found chen in thy sight, put, now, thy yad under my thigh, and do chesed and emes with me; bury me not, now, in Mitzrayim;"
Bereshis,47,30,"But I will lie with my avot, and thou shalt carry me out of Mitzrayim, and bury me in their kever. And he said, I will do as thou hast said."
Bereshis,47,31,"And he said, Swear unto me. And he swore unto him. And Yisroel prostrated toward the rosh hamittah."
Bereshis,48,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that one told Yosef, Hinei, Avicha is choleh (ill) ; and he took with him his two banim, Menasheh and Ephrayim."
Bereshis,48,2,"And one told Ya'akov, and said, Hinei, the ben of thee Yosef cometh unto thee; and Yisroel strengthened himself, and sat up upon the mittah (bed)."
Bereshis,48,3,"And Ya'akov said unto Yosef, El Shaddai appeared unto me at Luz in Eretz Kena'an, and made on me a brocha,"
Bereshis,48,4,"And said unto me, Hineni, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a kehal of ammim; and will give HaAretz Hazot to thy zera after thee for an achuzzat olam (everlasting possession)."
Bereshis,48,5,"And now thy two banim, Ephrayim and Menasheh, which were born unto thee in Eretz Mitzrayim before I came unto thee into Mitzrayim, are mine; like Reuven and Shim'on, they shall be mine."
Bereshis,48,6,"And thy moledet, which are born to thee after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the shem of their achim in their nachalah."
Bereshis,48,7,"And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in Eretz Kena'an in the way, when there was yet but a space of land to go unto Ephratah; and I buried her there by the derech Ephrat; the same is Beit-Lechem."
Bereshis,48,8,"And Yisroel beheld Bnei Yosef, and said, Who are these?"
Bereshis,48,9,"And Yosef said unto aviv, They are my banim, whom Elohim hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, now, unto me, and I will make upon them a brocha."
Bereshis,48,10,"Now the eyes of Yisroel were dim from age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them."
Bereshis,48,11,"And Yisroel said unto Yosef, I never expected to see thy face; and, hinei, Elohim hath showed me also thy zera."
Bereshis,48,12,"And Yosef brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the ground."
Bereshis,48,13,"And Yosef took them both, Ephrayim in his yamin toward smol Yisroel, and Menasheh on his smol toward yamin Yisroel, and brought them near unto him."
Bereshis,48,14,"And Yisroel stretched out his yamin, and laid it upon rosh Ephrayim, who was the younger, and his smol upon rosh Menasheh, guiding his hands intentionally; for Menasheh was the bechor."
Bereshis,48,15,"And he made on Yosef a brocha, and said, HaElohim, before whom my Avot Avraham and Yitzchak did walk, HaElohim Who was Roeh to me all my life long unto this day,"
Bereshis,48,16,"The Malach which redeemed me from kol rah, may he make a brocha on the ne'arim, and let my shem be named on them, and the shem of my Avot Avraham and Yitzchak; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of ha'aretz."
Bereshis,48,17,"And when Yosef saw that aviv laid his yamin upon the rosh Ephrayim, it displeased him; and he took hold of yad aviv, to remove it from rosh Ephrayim unto rosh Menasheh."
Bereshis,48,18,"And Yosef said unto aviv, Not so, Avi; for this is the bechor; put thy yamin upon his rosh."
Bereshis,48,19,"And aviv refused, and said, I know it, beni (my son) , I know it; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly achiv hakaton shall be greater than he, and his zera shall become a multitude of Goyim."
Bereshis,48,20,"And he made a brocha on them that day, saying, In thee shall Yisroel bless, saying, Elohim make thee like Ephrayim and like Menasheh; and he set Ephrayim before Menasheh."
Bereshis,48,21,"And Yisroel said unto Yosef, Hinei I die; but Elohim shall be with you, and bring you back unto the Eretz Avoteichem."
Bereshis,48,22,"Moreover, I have given to thee one portion above thy achim, which I took out of the yad HaEmori with my cherev and with my keshet."
Bereshis,49,1,"And Ya'akov called unto his banim, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the acharit hayamim (last days)."
Bereshis,49,2,"Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye Bnei Ya'akov; and pay heed unto Yisroel Avichem."
Bereshis,49,3,"Reuven, thou art my bechor, my koach, and the reshit of my strength, the excellency of honor, and excellency of oz (power):"
Bereshis,49,4,"Unstable as mayim, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to mishkevei avicha (thy fatherʼs bed, i.e. incest) ; then defiledst thou it; he went up to my couch."
Bereshis,49,5,Shim'on and Levi are achim; kelei chamas (instruments of violence) are in their swords.
Bereshis,49,6,"O my nefesh, enter not thou into their sod (secret, council) ; unto their kehal, mine kavod, be not thou united; for in their anger they slaughtered ish, and in their ratzon (self-will) they lamed shor (ox)."
Bereshis,49,7,"Arur (cursed) be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel; I will dispense them in Ya'akov, and scatter them in Yisroel."
Bereshis,49,8,"Yehudah, thou art he whom thy achim yoducha (they will praise you) ; thy yad shall be in the oref (neck) of thine enemies; Bnei Avicha shall bow down before thee."
Bereshis,49,9,"Yehudah is the cub of an aryeh (lion) ; from the prey, beni (my son) , thou hast gone up; he stooped down, he couched like an aryeh, and like a lioness; who shall rouse him?"
Bereshis,49,10,"The shevet (sceptre) shall not depart from Yehudah, nor a Mekhokek (Lawgiver) from between his raglayim, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall be the obedience of the amim (peoples, nations)."
Bereshis,49,11,"He ties his foal unto the gefen (vine) , and his donkeyʼs colt unto the choice vine; he will wash his levush (garments) in yayin, and his robe in the dahm anavim (blood of grapes);"
Bereshis,49,12,"His eyes shall be darker with yayin, and his shinayim (teeth) whiter than cholov (milk)."
Bereshis,49,13,Zevulun shall dwell at the seashore; and he shall be a haven for oniyyot (ships) ; and his border shall be unto Tzidon.
Bereshis,49,14,Yissakhar is a strong chamor (donkey) lying down between two saddlebags;
Bereshis,49,15,"And he saw that a menuchah (resting place) was tov, and haaretz that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became oved (submitting, enslaved) at forced labor."
Bereshis,49,16,"Dan yadin (shall judge) his people, as one of the Shivtei Yisroel."
Bereshis,49,17,"Dan shall be a nachash beside the derech, a viper along the orach (path) that biteth the ikkvei sus (the horse heels) , so that its rider shall fall backward."
Bereshis,49,18,"I have waited for Thy Yeshu'ah (Salvation), Hashem."
Bereshis,49,19,"Gad, gedud (raider) shall raid him; but he shall raid akev ([at] the heel)."
Bereshis,49,20,"Out of Asher his lechem shall be rich, and he shall yield royal dainties."
Bereshis,49,21,Naphtali is a doe let loose; he giveth goodly sayings.
Bereshis,49,22,"Yosef is a ben of a fruit-tree, even ben of a fruit-tree near an ayin (spring, well) ; its daughters (i.e., branches) run over the wall;"
Bereshis,49,23,"The ba'alei khitzim (archers) provoke him, and shoot at him, and hate him;"
Bereshis,49,24,"But his keshet (bow) remained steady, and the arms of his hands remain strong, from the hands of the Avir Ya'akov, from there, from the Ro'eh, Even Yisroel;"
Bereshis,49,25,"And from El Avicha, who shall help thee; and Shaddai, who shall make brocha over thee with Birkat Shomayim above, Birkat Tehom that lieth beneath, Birkat Shadayim and of Rekhem."
Bereshis,49,26,"Birkat Avicha surpass the Birkat of my progenitors unto the utmost border of the giveot olam (everlasting hills) ; they shall come on the rosh Yosef, and on the brow of the Prince among his achim."
Bereshis,49,27,"Binyamin — a ze'ev (wolf) which tears in pieces; in the boker he shall devour the prey, and at erev he shall divide the plunder."
Bereshis,49,28,"All these are the Shivtei Yisroel; and this is it that Avichem spoke unto them, and made a brocha on them; every one according to his berakhah he blessed them."
Bereshis,49,29,"And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people; bury me with Avotai in the me'arah (cave) that is in the sadeh of Ephron the Chitti,"
Bereshis,49,30,"In the me'arah that is in the sadeh of Machpelah, which is near Mamre, in Eretz Kena'an, which Avraham bought with the sadeh of Ephron the Chitti for an achuzzat kever (burial estate)."
Bereshis,49,31,There they buried Avraham and Sarah his isha; there they buried Yitzchak and Rivkah his isha; and there I buried Leah.
Bereshis,49,32,The purchase of the sadeh and of the me'arah (cave) that is therein was from the Bnei Chet (Heth).
Bereshis,49,33,"And when Ya'akov had made an end of commanding his banim, he gathered up his raglayim into the mittah, and expired, and was gathered unto his people."
Bereshis,50,1,"And Yosef fell upon the face of Aviv, and wept over him, and kissed him."
Bereshis,50,2,And Yosef commanded his avadim the rofe'im (physicians) to embalm Aviv; and the rofe'im embalmed Yisroel.
Bereshis,50,3,And arba'im yom were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed; and the Mitzrayim mourned for him shivim yom (seventy days).
Bereshis,50,4,"And when the days of his mourning were past, Yosef spoke unto the Bais Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found chen in your eyes, speak, now, in the oznayim of Pharaoh, saying,"
Bereshis,50,5,"Avi made me swear, saying, Hinei, I die; in my kever which I dug for myself in Eretz Kena'an, there shalt thou bury me. Therefore let me go up, now, and bury Avi, and I will return."
Bereshis,50,6,"And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury Avicha, according as he made thee swear."
Bereshis,50,7,"And Yosef went up to bury Aviv; and with him went up all the avadim of Pharaoh, the zekenim of his Bais, and all the zekenim of Eretz Mitzrayim,"
Bereshis,50,8,"And kol Bais Yosef, and his achim, and Bais Aviv; only their little ones, and their tzon, and their bakar (cattle) , they left in Eretz Goshen."
Bereshis,50,9,And there went up with him both merkavot and parashim; and it was a very great machaneh.
Bereshis,50,10,"And they came to the goren (threshing floor) of Atad, which is beyond the Yarden, and there they mourned with a gadol and very bitter lamentation; and he made evel (mourning) for Aviv shivat yamim."
Bereshis,50,11,"And when the inhabitants of HaAretz, the Kena'ani, saw the evel (mourning) in the goren Atad, they said, This is a grievous evel to the Mitzrayim; therefore the shem of it was called Evel-Mitzrayim. It is beyond the Yarden."
Bereshis,50,12,And his [Ya'akovʼs] banim did unto him according as he commanded them;
Bereshis,50,13,"For his banim carried him into Eretz Kena'an, and buried him in the me'arah (cave) of the sadeh of Machpelah, near Mamre, the sadeh which Avraham had bought for an achuzzat kever (burial estate) and made the purchase from Ephron the Chitti."
Bereshis,50,14,"And, after burying Aviv, Yosef returned into Mitzrayim, he, and his achim, and all that went up with him to bury Aviv."
Bereshis,50,15,"And when the Achei Yosef (the brothers of Yosef) saw that Avihem was dead, they said, What if Yosef will hate us, and will certainly requite us all the ra'ah which we did unto him."
Bereshis,50,16,"And they sent word unto Yosef, saying, Avicha did command before he died, saying,"
Bereshis,50,17,"So shall ye say unto Yosef, Forgive, now, the peysha of thy achim, and their chattat; for they did unto thee ra'ah; and now, forgive the peysha of the Avdei Elohei Avicha. And Yosef wept when they spoke unto him."
Bereshis,50,18,"And his achim also went and fell down before him; and they said, Behold us, we are thy avadim."
Bereshis,50,19,"And Yosef said unto them, Fear not; for am I in the place of Elohim?"
Bereshis,50,20,"But as for you, ye intended ra'ah against me; but Elohim intended it for tovah, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save Am Rav (much people) alive."
Bereshis,50,21,"Now therefore fear ye not; I will provide for you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly unto their hearts."
Bereshis,50,22,"And Yosef dwelt in Mitzrayim, he, and Bais Aviv; and Yosef lived one hundred and ten shanim."
Bereshis,50,23,And Yosef saw Ephrayimʼs bnei shileshim (children to the third generation) ; also the Bnei Machir Ben Menasheh were brought up upon the birkei Yosef (knees of Yosef).
Bereshis,50,24,"And Yosef said unto his achim, I die; and Elohim will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto HaAretz which He promised by oath to Avraham, to Yitzchak, and to Ya'akov."
Bereshis,50,25,"And Yosef made the Bnei Yisroel take an oath, saying, Elohim will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my atzmot from hence."
Bereshis,50,26,"So Yosef died, being in age one hundred and ten shanim; and they embalmed him, and he was placed in an aron in Mitzrayim."
