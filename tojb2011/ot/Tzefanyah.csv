Tzefanyah,1,1,"The Devar Hashem which came unto Tzephanyah ben Cushi, ben Gedalyah, ben Amaryah, ben Chizkiyah, in the yamim of Yoshiyahu (Josiah) ben Amon, Melech Yehudah."
Tzefanyah,1,2,"I will utterly sweep away all things from off the adamah, saith Hashem."
Tzefanyah,1,3,"I will sweep away Adam (humankind) and Behemah (beast, animal, cattle) ; I will sweep away Oph HaShomayim (Birds of the Air) and the Dagim of HaYam (Fish of the Sea) , and the michsholim (stumbling blocks, what causes to fall into sin) with the resha'im; and I will cut off adam from off the adamah, saith Hashem."
Tzefanyah,1,4,"I will also stretch out Mine hand against Yehudah, and against all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim; and I will cut off from this place the she'ar HaBa'al (remnant of Ba'al) , and the shem (name) of the Kemarim (the idolatrous priests) with the [idolatrous] kohanim;"
Tzefanyah,1,5,"And those that worship the Tz'va HaShomayim (Army of Heaven, star g-ds) upon the rooftops; and those that worship and that swear [oaths] by Hashem , but also swear by Milcom;"
Tzefanyah,1,6,"And those that turned back from following Hashem ; and those that have not sought Hashem , nor inquired of Him."
Tzefanyah,1,7,"Hold thy peace (keep silent) at the presence of Adonai Hashem : for the Yom Hashem is at hand; for Hashem hath prepared a zevach (sacrifice), Hashem hath consecrated His guests."
Tzefanyah,1,8,"And it shall come to pass in the Yom Zevach Hashem , that I will punish the sarim (princes) , and Bnei HaMelech, and all such as are clothed with malbush nochri (foreign apparel)."
Tzefanyah,1,9,"In the same Yom also will I visit to punish all those that leap over the threshold, which fill their masters始 batim (houses) with chamas (violence) and mirmah (deceit)."
Tzefanyah,1,10,"And it shall come to pass in that Yom, saith Hashem , that there shall be the noise of a cry from Sha'ar HaDagim, and a wail from the Second Quarter of the city, and a loud crash from the hills."
Tzefanyah,1,11,"Howl, ye inhabitants of HaMakhtesh, for all the merchants are cut down; all they that weigh out kesef are cut off."
Tzefanyah,1,12,"And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Yerushalayim with nerot (lamps) , and visit to punish the [proud] men that are [complacently] settled on their lees; that say in their lev, Hashem will not do tov, neither will Hashem do rah."
Tzefanyah,1,13,"Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their batim a desolation; they shall also build batim, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant kramim (vineyards) , but not drink the yayin thereof."
Tzefanyah,1,14,"The Yom Hashem HaGadol is near, near and hastening quickly; the sound of the Yom Hashem is mar (bitter) ; there the gibbor (mighty man, warrior) cries aloud."
Tzefanyah,1,15,"That Yom is a Yom Evrah (day of wrath) , a Yom Tzarah and Metzukah (a day of trouble and distress, pressure) , a Yom of Sho'ah (catastrophe) and Meshoah (desolation) , a Yom of Choshech and Afelah (gloom) , a Yom of Anan and Arafel (thick darkness),"
Tzefanyah,1,16,"A Yom of the Shofar and Teruah (battle cry) against the fortified cities, and against the high battlements."
Tzefanyah,1,17,"And I will bring distress upon adam, that they shall walk like ivrim, because they have sinned against Hashem ; and their dahm shall be poured out like dust, and their bowels like dung."
Tzefanyah,1,18,"Neither their kesef nor their zahav shall be able to save them in the Yom Evrat Hashem (Day of Hashem 始s Wrath) ; but kol ha'aretz (the whole earth) shall be devoured by the eish of Hashem 始s kina (jealousy, zeal, passion) ; for He shall make a complete end, a terrible end, of kol yoshvei ha'aretz (all them that dwell on the earth)."
Tzefanyah,2,1,"Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O shameful nation;"
Tzefanyah,2,2,"Before the decree brings forth, before the day passes like the chaff, before the charon af Hashem comes upon you, before the Yom Af Hashem (Day of Hashem 始s Anger) comes upon you;"
Tzefanyah,2,3,"Seek ye Hashem , all ye anvei ha'aretz (humble of the land) , which have wrought His mishpat; seek tzedek, seek anavah (meekness, humility) ; it may be ye shall be hid in the Yom Af Hashem."
Tzefanyah,2,4,"For Azah (Gaza) shall be abandoned, and Ashkelon a desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod in broad day, and Ekron shall be uprooted."
Tzefanyah,2,5,"Hoy (Woe) unto the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of the Keretim (Cretans) ! The Devar Hashem is against you, O Kena'an, eretz of the Pelishtim (Philistines) . I will even destroy thee, that there no inhabitant remains."
Tzefanyah,2,6,"And the seacoast shall be dwellings and meadows for ro'im (shepherds) , and pens for tzon."
Tzefanyah,2,7,"And the coast shall be for the she'erit Bais Yehudah; they shall feed thereupon; in the batim (houses) of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the erev; for Hashem Eloheichem shall visit them, and restore their fortunes."
Tzefanyah,2,8,"I have heard the reproach of Moav, and the revilings of the Bnei Ammon, whereby they have reproached My nation, and magnified themselves against their territory."
Tzefanyah,2,9,"Therefore as I live, saith Hashem Tzva'os, Elohei Yisroel, Surely Moav shall be as Sodom, and the Bnei Ammon as Amora (Gomorrah) , a place of weeds and salt pits, and desolation ad olam; the She'erit Ami shall plunder them, and the remnant of My nation shall possess them."
Tzefanyah,2,10,"This shall they have in return for their ga'on (pride) , because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the Am Hashem Tzva'os."
Tzefanyah,2,11," Hashem will be terrible unto them; for He will reduce to nothing all the elohei ha'aretz (g-ds of the land) ; and men shall worship Hashem , everyone from his place, even all the coasts and islands of the Goyim."
Tzefanyah,2,12,"Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by My cherev."
Tzefanyah,2,13,"And Hashem will stretch out His hand against the tzafon (north) , and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, a dry waste like a midbar."
Tzefanyah,2,14,"And herds shall lie down in the midst of it, all the beasts of the Goyim; both the desert owl and the screech owl will roost on her columns; their voice shall hoot in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds; the beams of cedar will be exposed."
Tzefanyah,2,15,"This is HaIr HaAlizah (the rejoicing city) that dwelt carelessly, that said in her lev, I am, and there is none beside me; how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! Every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and shake his fist."
Tzefanyah,3,1,"Hoy (woe) to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!"
Tzefanyah,3,2,She obeyed not the voice; she received not musar (correction) ; her bitachon (trust) was not in Hashem ; she drew not near to her G-d.
Tzefanyah,3,3,Her sarim (princes) within her are roaring arayot; her shofetim are evening wolves; they leave nothing for the boker (morning).
Tzefanyah,3,4,"Her nevi'im are arrogant, anshei bogedot (treacherous persons) ; her kohanim have profaned the kodesh, they have done violence to the torah."
Tzefanyah,3,5, Hashem Tzaddik is in the midst thereof; He will do no injustice; boker by boker doth Hashem dispense mishpat; He faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no boshet (shame).
Tzefanyah,3,6,"I have cut off the Goyim; their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no ish (man) , that there is no inhabitant."
Tzefanyah,3,7,"I said, Surely thou wilt fear Me, thou wilt accept musar (correction, instruction) ; so that her dwelling place should not be cut off, despite everything for which I punished her; but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings."
Tzefanyah,3,8,"Therefore wait ye upon Me, saith Hashem , until the Yom that I rise up for a prey; My determination is to gather the Goyim, that I may assemble the mamlachot, to pour upon them Mine indignation, even all My charon af; for kol ha'aretz (all the earth) shall be devoured with the eish of My kina (jealousy)."
Tzefanyah,3,9,"For then will I restore to the people a safah berurah (pure language, purified lip) , that they may all call upon the Shem Hashem , to serve Him with shekhem echad (one shoulder, one accord)."
Tzefanyah,3,10,"From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia My suppliants, even the daughter of My dispersed, shall bring Mine minchah."
Tzefanyah,3,11,"In that Yom shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against Me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy ga'avah (pride) , and thou shalt no more be haughty because of My Har Hakodesh."
Tzefanyah,3,12,"I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall take refuge in the Shem Hashem."
Tzefanyah,3,13,"The she'erit Yisroel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a leshon tarmit (tongue of deceitfulness) be found in their mouth; for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid."
Tzefanyah,3,14,"Sing, O Bat Tziyon; shout, O Yisroel; be glad and rejoice with all the lev, O Bat Yerushalayim."
Tzefanyah,3,15," Hashem hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy. The Melech Yisroel, even Hashem , is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not see evil any more."
Tzefanyah,3,16,"In that Yom it shall be said to Yerushalayim, Fear thou not; and to Tziyon, Let not thine hands hang limp."
Tzefanyah,3,17," Hashem thy G-d in the midst of thee is gibbor; He will save, He will rejoice over thee with simchah; He will quiet [you] in His ahavah (love) , He will joy over thee with singing."
Tzefanyah,3,18,"They that mourn I will gather for the mo'ed (time of the feast) , who are of thee [O Tziyon], to whom the cherpah (reproach) presses upon them."
Tzefanyah,3,19,"Hinei, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee; and I will save her that is lame, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land of their boshet (shame)."
Tzefanyah,3,20,"At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you; for I will make you a shem and a tehillah among Kol Amei Ha'aretz (all the peoples of the earth) , when I turn back your captivity and restore your fortunes before your eyes, saith Hashem."
