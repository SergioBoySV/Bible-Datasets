Yirmeyah,1,1,"Divrei Yirmeyah ben Chilkiyah, of the kohanim that were in Anatot in Eretz Binyamin;"
Yirmeyah,1,2,"To whom the Devar Hashem came in the days of Yoshiyah ben Amon Melech Yehudah, in the thirteenth year of his reign."
Yirmeyah,1,3,"And in the days of Y'hoyakim ben Yoshiyah Melech Yehudah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Tzidkiyah ben Yoshiyah Melech Yehudah, that is, until the Golus Yerushalayim captive in the fifth month."
Yirmeyah,1,4,"Then the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yirmeyah,1,5,"Before I formed thee in the beten I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the rechem I set thee apart as kodesh, and I ordained thee a navi unto the Goyim."
Yirmeyah,1,6,"Then said I, Ah, Adonoi Hashem ! hinei, I have no da'as to speak; for I am a na'ar."
Yirmeyah,1,7,"But Hashem said unto me, Say not, Na'ar anochi; for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak."
Yirmeyah,1,8,"Be not afraid of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,1,9,"Then Hashem put forth His yad, and touched my mouth. And Hashem said unto me, Hinei, I put My words in thy mouth."
Yirmeyah,1,10,"See, I have this yom set thee over the Goyim and over the mamlachot (kingdoms) , to uproot, and to tear down, and to destroy, and to demolish, to build, and to plant."
Yirmeyah,1,11,"Moreover the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying, Yirmeyah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a makel SHAQED (a branch of an almond tree)."
Yirmeyah,1,12,"Then said Hashem unto me, Thou hast well seen: for SHOQED (WATCHING) I am over My Devar to carry it out."
Yirmeyah,1,13,"And the Devar Hashem came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a SIYR NAFUACH (A BOILING CAULDRON) tipping over from the north."
Yirmeyah,1,14,"Then Hashem said unto me, From the north hara'ah (the evil, disaster) TIPATACH (SHALL BE POURED OUT) upon all the inhabitants of HaAretz."
Yirmeyah,1,15,"For, hineni, I am now summoning all the mishpekhot mamlechot of the north, saith Hashem ; they shall come, they shall set every one his kisse at the petach Sha'arei Yerushalayim, and against all the surrounding chomot thereof, against all the towns of Yehudah."
Yirmeyah,1,16,"And I will pronounce My mishpatim against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken Me, and have burned ketoret unto elohim acherim, and worshiped the works of their own hands."
Yirmeyah,1,17,"Thou therefore tighten thy gartel of readiness, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee; be not fearful before them, lest I make thee fearful before them."
Yirmeyah,1,18,"For, hinei, I have made thee today an ir mivtzar (a fortified city) , and an ammud barzel, and a chomat nechoshet against kol HaAretz, against the melachim of Yehudah, against the sarim thereof, against the kohanim thereof, and against the am ha'aretz."
Yirmeyah,1,19,"And they shall make war against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith Hashem , to deliver thee."
Yirmeyah,2,1,"Moreover the Devar Hashem came to me, saying,"
Yirmeyah,2,2,"Go and cry, shouting in the ears of Yerushalayim, saying, Thus saith Hashem ; I remember thee, the chesed of thy ne'urim, the ahavas of thy days as a kallah, when thou wentest after Me in midbar, in an eretz that was not sown."
Yirmeyah,2,3,"Yisroel was Kodesh unto Hashem , and the reshit (firstfruit) of his tevu'ah (crop) : all that devour him are held guilty; ra'ah shall overtake them, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,2,4,"Hear ye the Devar Hashem , O Beis Ya'akov, and all the mishpekhot of Bais Yisroel:"
Yirmeyah,2,5,"Thus saith Hashem , What avel (wrong, fault) have avoteichem found in Me, that they are strayed far from Me, and have walked after hevel (vain, empty delusion) , and are become deluded?"
Yirmeyah,2,6,"Neither did they ask, Where is Hashem that brought us up out of Eretz Mitzrayim, that led us through the midbar, through an eretz of deserts and pits, through an eretz tziyyah (land of drought) and tzalmavet, through eretz that no ish passed through, where no adam dwelt?"
Yirmeyah,2,7,"And I brought you into an eretz hacarmel, to eat the pri thereof and the tovah thereof; but when ye entered, ye made My land tameh, and made My nachalah a to'evah."
Yirmeyah,2,8,"The Kohanim asked not, Where is Hashem ? And they that handle the Torah had no da'as of Me; the ro'im also rebelled against Me, and the nevi'im prophesied by Ba'al, and walked after worthless things."
Yirmeyah,2,9,"Therefore I will yet bring lawsuit against you, saith Hashem , and against bnei beneichem will I bring lawsuit."
Yirmeyah,2,10,"For pass over to the isles of Kittim, and look; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there has ever been anything like this."
Yirmeyah,2,11,"Hath ever a nation changed elohim, and these no elohim at all? But My people have exchanged their kavod for that which is worthless."
Yirmeyah,2,12,"Be appalled, O ye Shomayim, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,2,13,"For Ami have committed shtayim ra'ot (two evils) ; they have forsaken Me, the fountain of Mayim Chayim, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no mayim."
Yirmeyah,2,14,Is Yisroel an eved? Is he a homeborn slave? Why has he become plunder?
Yirmeyah,2,15,"The young lions roared upon him, and growled, and they made his Eretz waste; his towns are burned without inhabitant."
Yirmeyah,2,16,Also the Bnei Noph and Tachpanches have broken the crown of thy head.
Yirmeyah,2,17,"Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken Hashem Eloheicha, when He led thee by the derech?"
Yirmeyah,2,18,"And now what hast thou to do in the derech Mitzrayim, to drink the waters of the Shichor ([Nile] River )? Or what hast thou to do in the derech Ashur (Assyria) , to drink the waters of the Euphrates [River]?"
Yirmeyah,2,19,"Thine own ra'ah shall correct thee, and thy meshuvot (backslidings) shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and mar (bitter) , that thou hast forsaken Hashem Eloheicha, and that My pachad is not in thee, saith Adonoi Hashem Tzva'os."
Yirmeyah,2,20,"For long ago I have broken thy ol (yoke) , and tore off thy bonds; and thou saidst, I will not serve; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou hast sprawled, playing the zonah."
Yirmeyah,2,21,"Yet I had planted thee a choice vine, wholly a zera emes. How then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a gefen nochriyah unto Me?"
Yirmeyah,2,22,"For though thou wash thee with lye, and take thee much soap, yet thine avon (iniquity) is marked before Me, saith Adonoi Hashem."
Yirmeyah,2,23,"How canst thou say, I am not tameh, I have not gone after Ba'alim? See thy derech in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift camel traversing her ways;"
Yirmeyah,2,24,"A pereh used to the midbar, that sniffs up the ruach in the craving of her nefesh; in her occasion [of heat] who can turn her away? All they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her."
Yirmeyah,2,25,"Withhold thy regel from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst; but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved zarim, and after them will I go."
Yirmeyah,2,26,"As the ganav is ashamed when he is caught, so is the Bais Yisroel ashamed; they, their melachim, their sarim, and their kohanim, and their nevi'im."
Yirmeyah,2,27,"Saying to Etz (wood) , Thou art Avi; and to Even (stone) , Thou hast brought me forth; for they have turned their back unto Me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and hoshi'einu (save us)."
Yirmeyah,2,28,"But where are thy elohim that thou hast made for thee? Let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble; for as many as are the mispar (number) of thy towns are thy elohim, O Yehudah."
Yirmeyah,2,29,"Why will ye bring lawsuit against Me? Ye all have rebelled against Me, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,2,30,"In vain have I struck your banim; they received no musar; your own cherev hath devoured your nevi'im, like a destroying lion."
Yirmeyah,2,31,"O HaDor (Generation) , heed ye the Devar Hashem . Have I been a midbar unto Yisroel? An eretz of great darkness? Madu'a (why) say Ami, We are free; we will come no more unto Thee?"
Yirmeyah,2,32,"Can a betulah forget her jewelry, or a kallah her adornments? Yet My people have forgotten Me yamim ein mispar (days without number)."
Yirmeyah,2,33,How well thou direct thy derech to seek ahavah? Therefore hast thou also taught hara'ot (the worst women) the darkhei (ways) of thee.
Yirmeyah,2,34,Also in thy skirts is found the dahm of the nefashot of the innocent poor; although you never caught them breaking in. Yet concerning all these
Yirmeyah,2,35,"Thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely His anger shall turn from me. Hineni, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, Loh chatati (I have not sinned)."
Yirmeyah,2,36,"Why doest thou gad about so much to change the course of thy derech? Thou also shalt be ashamed of Mitzrayim, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria."
Yirmeyah,2,37,"Yea, thou shalt go forth from this, and thine hands upon thine head; for Hashem hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them."
Yirmeyah,3,1,"They say, If an ish put away [in divorce] his isha, and she go from him, and become another man ºs, shall he return unto her again? Shall not that eretz be defiled and forbidden? But thou hast played the zonah with re'im rabbim (many lovers) ; yet shuv (turn) to Me, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,3,2,"Lift up thine eyes unto the hilltops, and see! Where hast thou not been lain with? In the drakhim (ways, roads) hast thou sat [waiting] for them, as the nomad in the midbar; and thou hast defiled the eretz with thy zenut (whoredom, prostitution) and with thy ra'ah (wickedness)."
Yirmeyah,3,3,"Therefore the revivim (showers) have been withheld, and there hath been no malkosh (latter rain, spring rain) ; and thou hadst a metzach isha zonah (whore ºs forehead) , and thou refusedst to blush with shame."
Yirmeyah,3,4,"Wilt thou not from this time cry unto Me, Avi, Thou art the Alluf (Guide, Friend) of my neurim (youth)?"
Yirmeyah,3,5,"Will He reserve His anger l'olam? Will He keep it lanetzach? Hinei, this is what you preach, but you practice all hara'ot (the evils) you can."
Yirmeyah,3,6," Hashem said also unto me in the days of Yoshiyah HaMelech, Hast thou seen that which meshuvah Yisroel (backsliding Yisroel) hath done? She is gone up upon every high hill and under every green tree, and there hath played the zonah."
Yirmeyah,3,7,"And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto Me. But she returned not. And her treacherous achot Yehudah saw it."
Yirmeyah,3,8,"And I saw, when for all the causes whereby meshuvah Yisroel (backsliding Yisroel) committed adultery, I had put her away, and given her a sefer keritut (bill of divorce) ; yet her treacherous achot Yehudah feared not, but went and played the zonah also."
Yirmeyah,3,9,"And it came to pass through the lightness with which she took her zenut (whoredom) , that she defiled HaAretz, and committed adultery with HaEven (the Stone) and with HaEtz (the Wood)."
Yirmeyah,3,10,"And yet for all this her treacherous achot Yehudah hath not returned unto Me with her kol lev, but in sheker (falsity, pretense, an insincere religious spirit) , saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,3,11,"And Hashem said unto me, Meshuvah Yisroel hath come nearer to justifying herself than treacherous Yehudah."
Yirmeyah,3,12,"Go and proclaim these devarim toward the north, and say, Return, thou meshuvah Yisroel, saith Hashem ; and I will not cast down Mine anger to fall upon you; for I am chasid (displaying chesed, mercy) , saith Hashem , and I will not keep anger l'olam."
Yirmeyah,3,13,"Only acknowledge thine avon (iniquity, guilt of wrongdoing) , that thou hast rebelled against Hashem your G-d, and hast scattered thy favors to the zarim under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed My voice, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,3,14,"Shuvu (Turn) , O banim shovaviv (backsliding children) , saith Hashem ; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one from a town, and two from a mishpakhah, and I will bring you to Tziyon:"
Yirmeyah,3,15,"And I will give you ro'im according to Mine lev, which shall feed you with da'as and seichel."
Yirmeyah,3,16,"And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in HaAretz, in those days, saith Hashem , they shall say no more, The Aron Brit Hashem : neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they ask for it; neither shall another be fashioned."
Yirmeyah,3,17,"At that time they shall call Yerushalayim the Kisse Hashem ; and all the Goyim shall be gathered unto it, to the Shem Hashem , to Yerushalayim; neither shall they walk any more after the sherirut libam harah (the stubbornness of their evil heart)."
Yirmeyah,3,18,"In those days Bais Yehudah shall walk with Bais Yisroel, and they shall come together out of the eretz tzafon to HaAretz that I have given for a nachalah unto Avoteichem."
Yirmeyah,3,19,"But I said, How shall I set thee among the banim, and give thee an eretz chemdah (a land of desire) , the most beautiful nachalah of the Goyim? And I said, Thou shalt call Me, Avi; and shalt not turn back from following Me."
Yirmeyah,3,20,"Surely as an isha treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with Me, O Bais Yisroel, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,3,21,"A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and tachanunei Bnei Yisroel (supplications of the Children of Israel) ; for they have perverted their derech, and they have forgotten Hashem Eloheihem."
Yirmeyah,3,22,"Shuvu (return) , ye banim shovavim (backsliding children) , and I will heal your meshuvot (backslidings) . Behold, we come unto Thee; for Thou art Hashem Eloheinu."
Yirmeyah,3,23,"Truly in sheker is Salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains; truly in Hashem Eloheinu is the Teshu'at Yisroel (Salvation of Israel)."
Yirmeyah,3,24,"For HaBoshet (the Shame), hath devoured the labor of Avoteinu from ne'ureinu (our youth) : their tzon and their bakar, their banim and their banot."
Yirmeyah,3,25,"We lie down in our Boshet (Shame) , and kelimateinu (our humiliation) covereth us; for we have sinned against Hashem Eloheinu, we and Avoteinu, from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of Hashem Eloheinu."
Yirmeyah,4,1,"If thou wilt make teshuvah, O Yisroel, saith Hashem , return unto Me; and if thou wilt put away thine shikkutzim (abominations) out of My sight, then shalt thou not be moved."
Yirmeyah,4,2,"And thou shalt swear, Chai Hashem , in emes, in mishpat, and in tzedakah; and the Goyim shall bless themselves in Him, and in Him shall they glory."
Yirmeyah,4,3,"For thus saith Hashem to Ish Yehudah and Yerushalayim, Break up your unplowed ground, and sow not among kotzim (thorns)."
Yirmeyah,4,4,"Circumcise yourselves to Hashem , and take the mohel knife to the arelot of your levav, ye Ish Yehudah and inhabitants of Yerushalayim: lest My fury break out like eish, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your deeds."
Yirmeyah,4,5,"Declare ye in Yehudah, and publish in Yerushalayim; and say, Blow ye the shofar in HaAretz. Cry out, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities."
Yirmeyah,4,6,"Raise up a nes (a banner, a flag pointing to the place of refuge) over Tziyon; take refuge, delay not; for I will bring ra'ah (evil, disaster) from the tzafon (north) , and shever gadol (great destruction)."
Yirmeyah,4,7,"The aryeh (lion) is come up from his thicket, and the Mashkhit Goyim (Destroyer of the Nations), is on his way, he is gone forth from his place to make thy eretz desolate; and thy cities shall be made to lie in ruins, without an inhabitant."
Yirmeyah,4,8,"For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the charon af Hashem is not turned away from us."
Yirmeyah,4,9,"And it shall come to pass at that day, saith Hashem , that the lev HaMelech shall be disheartened, and the lev hasarim; and the kohanim shall be horror-struck, and the nevi'im dumbfounded."
Yirmeyah,4,10,"Then said I, Adonoi Hashem ! Surely Thou hast greatly misled HaAm HaZeh and Yerushalayim, saying, Shalom yeheyeh lachem (Ye shall have shalom) ; whereas the cherev is near unto the nefesh."
Yirmeyah,4,11,"At that time shall it be told HaAm HaZeh and Yerushalayim, A ruach tzach (a dry wind, sirocco) from the high places in the midbar toward the Bat Ami, not to winnow, nor to cleanse,"
Yirmeyah,4,12,Even a ruach maleh (strong wind) from those places shall come from Me; now also I will pronounce mishpatim against them.
Yirmeyah,4,13,"Hinei, he shall come up like ananim (clouds) , and his merkavot shall be like the whirlwind; his susim are swifter than nesharim (eagles) . Oy lanu! (Woe unto us!) For we are ruined."
Yirmeyah,4,14,"O Yerushalayim, wash thine lev from rah, that thou mayest be saved. Ad mosai (how long, how much longer) shall thy sinful machsh'vot lodge within thee?"
Yirmeyah,4,15,"For a kol (voice) declareth from Dan, and publisheth evil tidings from Mt Ephrayim."
Yirmeyah,4,16,"Tell the Goyim; hinei, spread the news to Yerushalayim, that notzrim (besiegers) come from a far country, and raise their voice against the cities of Yehudah."
Yirmeyah,4,17,"As shomrim of a sadeh, they are against her all around; because she hath been rebellious against Me, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,4,18,"Thy derech and thy deeds have brought these things upon thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is mar (bitter) , for it hath touched upon thine lev."
Yirmeyah,4,19,"My innards, my innards! I am pained at my very lev; my lev is pounding in me; I cannot keep silent, because thou hast heard, O my nefesh, the kol shofar (sound of the shofar) , the teru'at milchamah (battle alarm of war)."
Yirmeyah,4,20,"Shever (destruction) follows after shever; for the whole land lies in ruins; suddenly are my ohalim destroyed, and my canopies rega."
Yirmeyah,4,21,"Ad mosai (how long) shall I see the nes (banner) , and hear the kol shofar?"
Yirmeyah,4,22,"For Ami is foolish, they have not known Me; they are stupid banim, and they have no understanding; they are chachamim to do evil, but to do good they have no da'as."
Yirmeyah,4,23,"I beheld ha'aretz, and, hinei, it was tohu vavohu; and HaShomayim ‚Äî there was no ohr."
Yirmeyah,4,24,"I beheld the mountains, and, hinei, they quaked, and all the hills had crumbled."
Yirmeyah,4,25,"I beheld, and, hinei, there was no adam, and kol oph HaShomayim fled away."
Yirmeyah,4,26,"I beheld, and, hinei, the carmel was a midbar, and all the cities thereof lay in ruins before Hashem , before the charon af Hashem."
Yirmeyah,4,27,"For thus hath Hashem said, A wasteland shall be kol HaAretz; yet I will not make a complete end of it."
Yirmeyah,4,28,"For this reason HaAretz shall mourn, and HaShomayim above turn black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not relent, neither will I turn back from it."
Yirmeyah,4,29,"Kol HaIr shall flee at the noise of the parash and the romeh keshet (the archer) ; they shall run into thickets, and climb up among the kefim (rocks) ; every city shall be deserted, and not an ish dwell therein."
Yirmeyah,4,30,"And thou, O plundered one, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with scarlet, though thou deckest thee with jewelry of zahav, though thou paintest thy eyes with cosmetics, in vain thou adornest thyself; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy nefesh."
Yirmeyah,4,31,"For I have heard a kol (outcry) like that of a woman in travail, and in labor pain like that of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of Bat Tziyon, that waileth, that stretcheth out her hands, saying, Oy nah li (Woe is me now) ! for my nefesh is weary because of murderers."
Yirmeyah,5,1,"Run ye to and fro through the chutzot Yerushalayim (streets of Jerusalem) , and see now, and know, and seek in the rechovot thereof, if ye can find an ish, if there be any that dispenseth mishpat (justice) , that seeketh the emunah (faith) ; and I will forgive her."
Yirmeyah,5,2,"And though they say, Chai Hashem ; surely they swear lasheker (falsely)."
Yirmeyah,5,3," Hashem , are not Thine eyes upon emunah? Thou hast struck them, but they felt no anguish; Thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to accept musar; they have made their faces harder than stone; they have refused to make teshuvah."
Yirmeyah,5,4,"Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they know not the Derech Hashem , nor the Mishpat Eloheihem."
Yirmeyah,5,5,"I will get me unto the Gedolim, and will speak unto them; for they have known the Derech Hashem , and the Mishpat Eloheihem; but these have altogether broken off the ol (yoke) , and burst the bonds."
Yirmeyah,5,6,"Therefore an aryeh (lion) out of the forest shall slay them, and a ze'ev (wolf) of the deserts shall destroy them, a namer (leopard) shall prowl near their towns; every one that ventureth out from there shall be torn to pieces; because their peysha'im (rebellions) are many, and their meshuvot (backslidings) are increased."
Yirmeyah,5,7,"How shall I forgive thee for this? Thy banim have forsaken Me, and sworn by them that are no elohim; when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and trooped to the bais zonah."
Yirmeyah,5,8,"They were like well-fed, lusty susim: every one neighed after the isha of his neighbor."
Yirmeyah,5,9,Shall I not visit [to punish] for these things? saith Hashem ; and shall not My Nefesh be avenged on such a Goy as this?
Yirmeyah,5,10,"Go ye up through her rows of vines, and cut down; but make not a full end; take away her branches; for they are not Hashem  ºs."
Yirmeyah,5,11,"For Bais Yisroel and Bais Yehudah have dealt very treacherously against Me, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,5,12,"They have spoken lies about Hashem , and said, Lo hu (not He) ; neither shall ra'ah come upon us; neither shall we see cherev nor ra'av (famine);"
Yirmeyah,5,13,"And the nevi'im shall become ruach, and the Devar is not in them; thus shall it be done unto them."
Yirmeyah,5,14,"Therefore thus saith Hashem Elohei Tzva'os, Because ye speak this devar, hinei, I will make My Devarim in thy mouth an eish, and HaAm HaZeh etzim (wood) , and it shall consume them."
Yirmeyah,5,15,"Hineni, I will bring a Goy (Nation) upon you from afar, O Bais Yisroel, saith Hashem ; it is a powerful nation, a goy me'olam (an ancient nation) , a nation whose leshon thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say."
Yirmeyah,5,16,"Their quiver is as an open kever (grave) , they are all gibborim."
Yirmeyah,5,17,"And they shall devour thine katzir (harvest) , and thy lechem, which thy banim and thy banot should eat; they shall devour thy tzon and thine bakar; they shall eat up thy gefen and thy te'enah (fig tree) ; they shall impoverish thy fortified cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the cherev."
Yirmeyah,5,18,"Nevertheless in those days, saith Hashem , I will not make a full end with you."
Yirmeyah,5,19,"And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Why doeth Hashem Eloheinu all these things unto us? Then shalt thou answer them, As ye have forsaken Me, and served elohei nechar (foreign g-ds, strange g-ds) in your land, so shall ye serve zarim in an eretz not your own."
Yirmeyah,5,20,"Declare this in Bais Ya'akov, and publish it in Yehudah, saying,"
Yirmeyah,5,21,"Hear now this, O Am Sakhal (foolish people) without understanding; which have eynayim (eyes) , and see not; which have oznayim (ears) , and hear not;"
Yirmeyah,5,22,"Fear ye not Me? saith Hashem ; will ye not tremble at My Presence, Who hath placed the chol (sand) as the boundary of the yam by a chok olam, that it cannot transgress; and though the waves thereof toss, yet they cannot prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?"
Yirmeyah,5,23,But HaAm Hazeh hath a lev sorer (stubborn heart) and moreh (rebellious) ; they have revolted and departed.
Yirmeyah,5,24,"Neither say they in their lev, Let us now fear Hashem Eloheinu, that giveth geshem, both the yoreh (former rain, autumn rain) and the malkosh (latter rain, spring rain) in season; He secureth unto us shavu'ot chukkot katzir (the appointed weeks of the harvest)."
Yirmeyah,5,25,"Your avonot (iniquities) have turned away these things, and your chatta'ot (sins) have deprived hatov from you."
Yirmeyah,5,26,"For among Ami are found resha'im; they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a mashkhit (trap) , they catch anashim."
Yirmeyah,5,27,"As a cage is full of oph, so are their batim (houses) full of mirmah; therefore they are become powerful and oshir (rich, wealthy)."
Yirmeyah,5,28,"They have grown fat and sleek; yea, their wicked deeds are without limit; the cause of the yatom they do not plead, yet they prosper; and the mishpat evyonim (right of the poor people) they do not defend."
Yirmeyah,5,29,Shall I not visit [to punish] for these things? saith Hashem ; shall not My nefesh be avenged on such a Goy (Nation) as this?
Yirmeyah,5,30,An astonishing and horrible thing is committed in HaAretz;
Yirmeyah,5,31,"The nevi'im prophesy falsely, and the kohanim rule at their direction; and My people love to have it this way; but what will ye do in the end?"
Yirmeyah,6,1,"O ye Bnei Binyamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Yerushalayim, and blow the shofar in Tekoa, and kindle the fire signal on Beit-HaKerem; for ra'ah (evil, disaster) appeareth out of the tzafon (north) , and shever gadol (great destruction)."
Yirmeyah,6,2,"Bat Tziyon, so beautiful and delicate, I will destroy."
Yirmeyah,6,3,The ro'im (shepherds) with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their ohalim against her all around; they shall pasture each his portion.
Yirmeyah,6,4,"Prepare ye milchamah against her; arise, and let us go up to attack at noon. Oy unto us! For the yom fadeth away, for the shadows of erev are lengthening."
Yirmeyah,6,5,"Arise, and let us attack ba'lailah, and let us destroy her fortresses."
Yirmeyah,6,6,"For thus hath Hashem Tzva'os said, Cut ye down trees, and throw up a solelah (siege ramp) against Yerushalayim; this is the Ir that must be visited [for punishment]; oshek (oppression) is rampant within her."
Yirmeyah,6,7,"As a well casteth afresh her waters, so she casteth afresh her rah (wickedness) ; chamas and shod (destruction) is heard in her; before Me tamid (continually) is sickness and wounds."
Yirmeyah,6,8,"Be thou warned, O Yerushalayim, lest My nefesh depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, an eretz not inhabited."
Yirmeyah,6,9,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, They shall thoroughly glean the She'erit Yisroel (the Remnant of Israel) as a gefen (vine) ; turn back thine yad once again like a grape gatherer over the vine tendrils."
Yirmeyah,6,10,"To whom can I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? Hinei, their ear is arelah (uncircumcised) , and to pay heed is beyond them; hinei, the Devar Hashem is unto them a reproach; they find no pleasure in it."
Yirmeyah,6,11,"Therefore I am full of the chamat Hashem ; I am weary with holding in; I will pour it out upon the olal in the street, and upon the assembly of bocherim together; for even the ish with the isha shall be caught, the zaken, those weighed down with yamim (days)."
Yirmeyah,6,12,"And their batim (houses) shall be turned over unto others, with their sadot and nashim together; for I will stretch out My yad upon the Yoshvei HaAretz (Inhabitants of the Land) , saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,6,13,"For from the katan of them even unto the gadol of them, every one is given to greediness for unjust gain; and from the navi even unto the kohen, every one doeth sheker (deceit, falsehood)."
Yirmeyah,6,14,"They have provided superficial treatment for Ami, saying, Shalom, shalom; v'ein shalom."
Yirmeyah,6,15,"Were they ashamed when they had committed to'evah (abomination) ? They were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush; therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I visit them [in punishment] they shall be brought down, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,6,16,"Thus saith Hashem , Stand ye in the derakhim (crossroads) , and look, and ask for the netivot olam (old paths) , where is the derech hatov (good road, way) , and walk therein, and ye shall find margo'a (rest) for your nefashot. But they said, We will not walk therein."
Yirmeyah,6,17,"Also I set tzofim (watchmen) over you, saying, Pay heed to the kol shofar (sound of the shofar) . But they said, We will not pay heed."
Yirmeyah,6,18,"Therefore hear, ye Goyim, and know, O Edah (Congregation) , what will happen to them."
Yirmeyah,6,19,"Hear, HaAretz (O Earth) ; hinei, I will bring ra'ah (evil, disaster) upon HaAm Hazeh, even the p'ri (fruit) of their machsh'vot (schemes) , because they have not paid heed unto My devarim, nor to My torah, but rejected it."
Yirmeyah,6,20,"To what purpose cometh there to Me frankincense from Sheva, and the sweet cane from a far country? Your olot (burnt offerings) are not acceptable, nor your zevakhim pleasing unto Me."
Yirmeyah,6,21,"Therefore thus saith Hashem , Hineni, I will lay michsholim (stumblingblocks) before HaAm HaZeh, and the Avot and the Banim together shall stumble upon them; the shakhen (neighbor) and his re'a (neighbor, friend) shall perish."
Yirmeyah,6,22,"Thus saith Hashem , Hinei, Am (an Army, a people) cometh from the eretz tzafon, and a Goy Gadol is aroused from the ends of the earth."
Yirmeyah,6,23,"They shall lay hold of keshet (bow) and kidon (spear) ; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their kol (voice) roareth like the yam; and they ride upon susim, set in array as ish for milchamah against thee, O Bat Tziyon."
Yirmeyah,6,24,"We have heard the fame thereof; our hands hang limp; tzarah (anguish) hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in labor."
Yirmeyah,6,25,"Go not forth into the sadeh, nor walk by the derech; for the cherev of the oyev (enemy) and magur (fear, terror) is on every side."
Yirmeyah,6,26,"O Bat Ami, gird thee with sackcloth, and roll thyself in ashes; make thee evel (mourning) , as for a yachid (only son) , most bitter lamentation; for the shoded (destroyer) shall suddenly come upon us."
Yirmeyah,6,27,"I have set thee for a bachon (tester, assayer) of Ami (My People) ; that thou mayest know and test their derech (way, conduct)."
Yirmeyah,6,28,"They are all maximum rebels, going about as rachil (talebearers, slanderers) ; they are nechoshet and barzel; they are all corrupt."
Yirmeyah,6,29,"The bellows blow, the oferet (lead) is consumed by the eish; the smelter ºs refining is in vain; for the ra'im are not drawn off."
Yirmeyah,6,30,"Nimas kesef (reprobate silver, rejected silver) shall men call them, because Hashem hath rejected them."
Yirmeyah,7,1,"The Devar that came to Yirmeyah from Hashem , saying,"
Yirmeyah,7,2,"Stand at the Sha'ar Beis Hashem , and preach there this word, and say, Hear the Devar Hashem , all ye of Yehudah, that enter in at these She'arim (Gates) l'hishta'chavot (to worship, to prostrate before) Hashem."
Yirmeyah,7,3,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, Elohei Yisroel, Amend your ways and your deeds, and I will cause you to dwell in makom hazeh (this place)."
Yirmeyah,7,4,"Trust ye not in divrei hasheker (lying words, words of falsehood) , saying, This is the Heikhal Hashem , the Heikhal Hashem , the Heikhal Hashem."
Yirmeyah,7,5,For if ye throughly amend your ways and your deeds; if ye throughly dispense mishpat between an ish and his re'a (neighbor);
Yirmeyah,7,6,"If ye oppress not the ger, the yatom, and the almanah, and shed not dahm naki (innocent blood) in this place, neither walk after elohim acherim to your hurt;"
Yirmeyah,7,7,"Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in HaAretz that I gave to Avoteichem, l'min olam v'ad olam (from forever to forever)."
Yirmeyah,7,8,"Hinei, ye trust in divrei sheker (lying words) , that are worthless."
Yirmeyah,7,9,"Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear l'sheker (falsely) , and burn ketoret unto Ba'al, and walk after elohim acherim whom ye know not;"
Yirmeyah,7,10,"And come and stand before Me in HaBeis Hazeh, which is called by Shmi, and say, We are delivered l'ma'an (in order to) do all these to'evot (abominations)?"
Yirmeyah,7,11,"Is HaBeis Hazeh, which is called by Shmi, become a me'arah paritzim (a cave, a den of robbers, criminals) in your eyes? Hinei, even I have been watching, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,7,12,"But go ye now unto My Makom (Place) which was in Shiloh, where I made dwell Shmi barishonah (at the first) , and see what I did to it because of the ra'at Ami Yisroel (the wickedness of My people Israel)."
Yirmeyah,7,13,"And now, because ye have done all these ma'asim, saith Hashem , and I spoke unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye paid not heed; and I called you, but ye answered not;"
Yirmeyah,7,14,"Therefore will I do unto this Beis, which is called by Shmi, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to Avoteichem, as I have done to Shiloh."
Yirmeyah,7,15,"And I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your achim, even the whole zera Ephrayim."
Yirmeyah,7,16,"Therefore pray not thou on behalf of HaAm Hazeh, neither lift up plea nor tefillah for them, neither make intercession to Me; for I will not hear thee."
Yirmeyah,7,17,Seest thou not what they do in the towns of Yehudah and in the chutzot (streets of) Yerushalayim?
Yirmeyah,7,18,"The banim gather wood, and the avot kindle the eish, and the nashim knead their batzek (dough) , to make cakes to the Malkat HaShomayim (Queen of Heaven) , and to pour out nesakhim (drink offerings) unto elohim acherim, that they may provoke Me to anger."
Yirmeyah,7,19,"Do they provoke Me to anger? saith Hashem ; are they not provoking themselves, even to boshet (shame) on their own faces?"
Yirmeyah,7,20,"Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem ; Hinei, Mine anger and My fury shall be poured out upon Hamakom Hazeh (this place) , upon haadam, and upon behemah, and upon the etz hasadeh, and upon the pri ha'adamah; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched."
Yirmeyah,7,21,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, Elohei Yisroel; Add your olot unto your zevakhim, and eat basar."
Yirmeyah,7,22,"For I spoke not unto Avoteichem, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of Eretz Mitzrayim, concerning olah or zevach;"
Yirmeyah,7,23,"But this thing I commanded them, saying, Obey My voice, and I will be for you Elohim (your G-d) , and ye shall be My people; and walk ye in kol HaDerech that I have commanded you, l'ma'an (in order that) it may go well with you."
Yirmeyah,7,24,"But they paid heed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the inclinations of the stubbornness of their lev harah (evil heart) , and went backward, and not forward."
Yirmeyah,7,25,"Since the day that Avoteichem came forth out of Eretz Mitzrayim unto this day I have even sent unto you all My servants the Nevi'im, daily rising up early and sending them;"
Yirmeyah,7,26,"Yet they paid heed not unto Me, nor inclined their ear, but stiffened stubbornly their neck; they did more evil than their Avot."
Yirmeyah,7,27,Therefore thou shalt speak all these devarim unto them; but they will not pay heed to thee; thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.
Yirmeyah,7,28,"But thou shalt say unto them, This is a Goy (Nation) that obeyeth not the voice of Hashem Elohav, nor respondeth to musar; haemunah (the faith) is lost, and is cut off from their mouth."
Yirmeyah,7,29,"Cut off thine hair, O Yerushalayim, and throw it away, and take up a kinah (lamentation) on barren heights; for Hashem hath rejected and abandoned the dor evrato (the generation of His wrath)."
Yirmeyah,7,30,"For the Bnei Yehudah have done rah in My sight, saith Hashem ; they have set their shikkutzim (abominations) in the Beis which is called by Shmi, to make it tameh."
Yirmeyah,7,31,"And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the Gey Ben Hinnom, to burn their banim and their banot in the eish; which I commanded them not, neither entered it into My mind."
Yirmeyah,7,32,"Therefore, hinei, the yamim are coming, saith Hashem , that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the Gey Ben Hinnom, but the Gey Haharegah (Valley of Slaughter) ; for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no room."
Yirmeyah,7,33,"And the nivlat HaAm Hazeh (carcass of this people) shall be food for the oph HaShomayim, and for the behemat ha'aretz; and none shall frighten them away."
Yirmeyah,7,34,"Then will I cause to cease from the towns of Yehudah, and from the chutzot Yerushalayim, the sound of joy, and the sound of simchah, the sound of the Choson (Bridegroom) and the sound of the Kallah (Bride) ; for HaAretz shall be desolate."
Yirmeyah,8,1,"At that time, saith Hashem , they shall remove the atzmot of the melachim of Yehudah, and the atzmot of his sarim, and the atzmot of the kohanim, and the atzmot of the nevi'im, and the atzmot of the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, out of their keverim;"
Yirmeyah,8,2,"And they shall spread them out before the shemesh, and the yarei'ach, and all the tz'va haShomayim, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have consulted, and whom they have worshiped; they shall not be gathered up, nor be buried in a kever; they shall be like domen upon the surface of ha'adamah."
Yirmeyah,8,3,"And mavet shall be chosen rather than chayyim by all the She'erit of them that remain of this mishpakhah hara'ah, which remain in all the places where I have banished them, saith Hashem Tzva'os."
Yirmeyah,8,4,"Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Hashem : Shall they fall, and not get up? Shall one turn away, and not turn back?"
Yirmeyah,8,5,"Why then does HaAm Hazeh turn away in perpetual meshuvah (backsliding) ? They hold fast to deceit, refusing to make teshuvah."
Yirmeyah,8,6,"I paid heed and heard, but they spoke not aright; no ish made teshuvah from his wickedness, saying, What have I done? Every one pursues his own course, like the sus (horse) charging into milchamah."
Yirmeyah,8,7,"Yea, the stork in the Shomayim knoweth her mo'adim (appointed times) ; and the turtledove and the swift and the crane are shomer over their time for migration; but Ami (My People) have no da'as (knowledge) of the Mishpat Hashem (rule, ordinance, regulation, law of Hashem)."
Yirmeyah,8,8,"How can ye say, We are chachamim (wise ones) , and the torat Hashem is with us, when, hinei, the et sheker (deceiving pen) of the sofrim (scribes) has made it into sheker (a falsehood )."
Yirmeyah,8,9,"The chachamim (wise men) are ashamed, they are dismayed and trapped; they have rejected the Devar Hashem ; so what chochmah (wisdom) is in them?"
Yirmeyah,8,10,"Therefore will I give their nashim unto others, and their sadot to them that shall inherit them; for every one from the katan even unto the gadol is greedy for unjust gain, from the navi even unto the kohen every one doeth sheker."
Yirmeyah,8,11,"For they give superficial treatment to the hurt of Bat Ami, saying, Shalom, shalom; v'ein shalom."
Yirmeyah,8,12,"Were they ashamed when they did to'evah (abomination) ? No, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they know to blush; therefore shall they fall among them that fall; in the time of their pekuddah (visitation [for punishment], time of reckoning) they shall be brought down, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,8,13,"I would surely have harvested them, saith Hashem , but no grapes are on the gefen, nor te'enim (figs) on the te'enah (fig tree) , even the leaf shall wither; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them."
Yirmeyah,8,14,"Why do we sit still? Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us perish there; for Hashem Eloheinu hath made us to perish, and given us mey rosh (poisonous water) to drink, because we have sinned against Hashem."
Yirmeyah,8,15,"We looked for shalom, but no tov came; and for et marpeh (a time of healing) , and, hinei, terror!"
Yirmeyah,8,16,"The snorting of his susim (horses) was heard from Dan; kol ha'aretz trembled at the sound of the neighing of his stallions; for they are come, and have devoured eretz, and all that is in it; the Ir (city), and those that dwell therein."
Yirmeyah,8,17,"For, hinei, I will send nachashim, tzifonim (vipers) , among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,8,18,"When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my lev is faint within me."
Yirmeyah,8,19,"Hinei, the voice of the cry of the Bat Ami from eretz markhakim (a land of places far away) : is Hashem not in Tziyon? Is her Melech not in her? Why have they provoked Me to anger with their pesilim (idols) , and with alien vanities (futile foreign g-ds)?"
Yirmeyah,8,20,"The katzir (harvest) is past, kayitz (summer) is ended, and loh noshanu (we are not saved)."
Yirmeyah,8,21,For the hurt of the Bat Ami am I hurt; I mourn; desolation hath taken hold on me.
Yirmeyah,8,22,Is there no tzori (medicinal balsam or balm) in Gil'ad; is there no rofeh (physician) there? Why then is the health of the Bat Ami not recovered?
Yirmeyah,9,1,"Oh that my rosh (head) were mayim, and mine eyes a makor dimah (a fountain of tears) , that I might weep yomam valailah for the slain of the Bat Ami!"
Yirmeyah,9,2,"Oh that I had in the midbar a malon orkhim (travelers º lodge) ; that I might leave my people, and go from them! For they are all no'afim (adulterers) , an atzeret bogedim (band of treacherous traitors)."
Yirmeyah,9,3,"And they bend to the ready their leshon like their keshet (bow) for sheker; but not for emunah have they prevailed in ha'aretz; for they proceed from ra'ah to ra'ah, and they know not Me, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,9,4,"Be ye shomer every one over his re'a (neighbor, friend) and trust ye not in kol ach (any brother) ; for kol ach will ya'akov (utterly supplant, deceive) , and every re'a (neighbor) will holech rakhil (walk as the slanderer, gossiper)."
Yirmeyah,9,5,"And they will deceive every one his re'a, and will not speak emes; they have taught their leshon to speak sheker, and weary themselves to commit iniquity."
Yirmeyah,9,6,"Thine habitation is in the midst of mirmah; through mirmah they refuse to know Me, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,9,7,"Therefore thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, Hineni, I will refine them, and test them; for what but this shall I do for the Bat Ami?"
Yirmeyah,9,8,"Their leshon is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh mirmah; one speaketh shalom to his re'a with his mouth, but inwardly he lieth in ambush."
Yirmeyah,9,9,Shall I not visit them [in punishment] for these things? saith Hashem . Shall not My Nefesh be avenged on such a Goy (nation) as this?
Yirmeyah,9,10,"I take up a weeping and nehi (lamentation) for the harim, and for the pastures of the midbar a kinah (lamentation) , because they are scorched, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the mikneh (cattle) ; both the oph haShomayim and the behemah are fled; they are gone."
Yirmeyah,9,11,"And I will make Yerushalayim a heap of ruins, and a ma'on of jackals; and I will make the towns of Yehudah desolate, without an inhabitant."
Yirmeyah,9,12,"Who is the ish hechacham (wise man) , that may understand this? And who is he to whom the mouth of Hashem hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what HaAretz perisheth and is scorched like a midbar, that none passeth through?"
Yirmeyah,9,13,"And Hashem saith, Because they have forsaken My torah which I set before them, and have not obeyed My voice, neither walked therein;"
Yirmeyah,9,14,"But have walked after the sherirut (stubbornness) of their own lev, and after Ba'alim, which their avot taught them;"
Yirmeyah,9,15,"Therefore thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, the Elohei Yisroel; Hineni, I will make this people eat la'anah (wormwood) , and give them poisoned water to drink."
Yirmeyah,9,16,"I will scatter them also among the Goyim, whom neither they nor their avot have known; and I will send a cherev after them, till I have consumed them."
Yirmeyah,9,17,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, Consider ye, and call for the wailing women, that they may come; and send for the chachamot (wise women) , that they may come;"
Yirmeyah,9,18,"And let them make haste, and take up a nehi (lamentation) for us, that our eyes may run down with dimah (tears) , and our eyelids gush out with mayim."
Yirmeyah,9,19,"For a sound of nehi (lamentation) is heard from Tziyon, How are we plundered! We are greatly ashamed, because we have forsaken eretz, because mishkenoteinu have expelled us."
Yirmeyah,9,20,"Yet hear the Devar Hashem , O ye nashim, and let your ear receive the word of His mouth, and teach your banot nehi (lamentation) , and everyone her re'a (neighbor) kinah (dirge)."
Yirmeyah,9,21,"For mavet (death) is come up into our windows, and is entered into our fortresses, to cut off the olal (children) from the street, and the bochurim from the rechovot."
Yirmeyah,9,22,"Speak, Thus saith Hashem , Even the nevilah of adam shall fall like domen (dung) upon the sadeh, and the omer (sheaf) after the kotzer (harvester) , and none shall gather them."
Yirmeyah,9,23,"Thus saith Hashem , Let not the chacham (wise man) glory in his chochmah, neither let the gibbor (mighty man) glory in his gevurah (might) , let not the oisher (rich man) glory in his riches;"
Yirmeyah,9,24,"But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth Me, that I am Hashem Who exercises chesed, mishpat, and tzedakah, on ha'aretz; for in these things I delight, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,9,25,"Hinei, the yamim come, saith Hashem , that I will punish kol mul b'arlah (all circumcized in arlah [only]);"
Yirmeyah,9,26,"Mitzrayim, and Yehudah, and Edom, and the Bnei Ammon, and Moav, and kol ketzutzei pe'ah (all in the farthest corners) , that dwell in the midbar; for all these Goyim are uncircumcised, and kol Bais Yisroel are arlei lev (uncircumcised in heart)."
Yirmeyah,10,1,"Hear ye the Davar which Hashem speaketh unto you, O Bais Yisroel."
Yirmeyah,10,2,"Thus saith Hashem , Learn not the Derech HaGoyim, and be not in awe of the otot HaShomayim; though the Goyim are in awe of them."
Yirmeyah,10,3,"For the [religious] chukkot (customs, statutes) of the nations are vain delusions; for one cutteth etz out of the ya'ar (forest) , the ma'aseh (handiwork) of the hands of the charash (workman, artisan) , with the axe."
Yirmeyah,10,4,"They deck it with kesef and with zahav; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it topple not."
Yirmeyah,10,5,"They are upright as the tomer (palm tree) , but speak not; they must needs be carried, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do rah, neither also is it in them to do tov."
Yirmeyah,10,6,"Forasmuch as there is none like unto Thee, Hashem ; Thou art gadol, and Thy Shem is gadol in gevurah."
Yirmeyah,10,7,"Who would not fear thee, O Melech HaGoyim? For this is Thy due; forasmuch as among all the chachamim of the Goyim, and in kol malchut of them, there is none like unto Thee."
Yirmeyah,10,8,But they are altogether stupid and foolish; the etz is a musar havalim (discipline of delusions).
Yirmeyah,10,9,"Hammered kesef is brought from Tarshish, and zahav from Uphaz, the ma'aseh (work, handiwork) of the charash (workman, artisan) , and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple is their clothing; they are all the ma'aseh (work) of cunning men."
Yirmeyah,10,10,"But Hashem is the Elohim Emes, He is the Elohim Chayyim, and the Melech Olam; at His wrath ha'aretz shall tremble, and the Goyim shall not be able to endure His indignation."
Yirmeyah,10,11,"Thus shall ye say unto them, The g-ds that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and min techot (from under) these heavens."
Yirmeyah,10,12,"He hath made eretz by His ko'ach, He hath established the tevel (world) by His chochmah, and hath stretched out Shomayim by His understanding."
Yirmeyah,10,13,"When He uttereth His voice, there is a multitude of mayim in Shomayim, and He causeth the clouds to ascend from the ends of ha'aretz; He maketh lightnings with matar (rain) , and bringeth forth the ruach (wind) out of His Otzerot."
Yirmeyah,10,14,"Kol Adam is stupid in his da'as; every goldsmith is shamed by the pesel (idol) ; for his nesekh (molten image) is sheker, and there is no ruach in them."
Yirmeyah,10,15,"They are hevel (vanity, delusion) , and the ma'aseh (work) of delusion; in the time of their pekudat (visitation, punishment) they shall perish."
Yirmeyah,10,16,"The chelek of Ya'akov is not like them; for the Yotzer HaKol (Maker of All, Creator of All) is He; and Yisroel is the shevet (rod) of His nachalah; Hashem Tzva'os Shmo."
Yirmeyah,10,17,"Gather up thy gear [for Exile] meEretz (from the Land) , O besieged inhabitant."
Yirmeyah,10,18,"For thus saith Hashem , Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of HaAretz at this time, and will bring distress upon them, so that find they may."
Yirmeyah,10,19,"Oy li! (woe is me) for my disaster! My wound is grievous; but I said, Truly this is a sickness, and I must bear it."
Yirmeyah,10,20,"My ohel is destroyed, and all my tent cords are broken; my banim are gone forth of me, and are no more; there is none to pitch any more my ohel, and to hang up my tent curtains."
Yirmeyah,10,21,"For the ro'im (shepherds, pastors) are become stupid, and inquire not of Hashem ; therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flock shall be scattered."
Yirmeyah,10,22,"Hinei, the noise! The report is come, and a great commotion out of Eretz Tzafon, to make the towns of Yehudah desolate, and a haunt of jackals."
Yirmeyah,10,23," Hashem , I know that the derech of adam (man) is not in himself; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps."
Yirmeyah,10,24," Hashem , correct me, but with mishpat; not in Thine anger, lest Thou bring me to nothing."
Yirmeyah,10,25,"Pour out Thy fury upon the Goyim that know Thee not, and upon the mishpekhot that call not on Shimecha (Thy Name); for they have eaten up Ya'akov, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate."
Yirmeyah,11,1,"The Davar that came to Yirmeyah from Hashem saying,"
Yirmeyah,11,2,"Hear ye the Divrei HaBrit Hazot, and speak unto the Ish Yehudah, and to the inhabitants of Yerushalayim;"
Yirmeyah,11,3,"And say thou unto them, Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel; Arur (cursed) be the ish that obeyeth not the Divrei HaBrit Hazot,"
Yirmeyah,11,4,"Which I commanded Avoteichem in the day that I brought them forth out from Eretz Mitzrayim, from the kur habarzel (the furnace of iron) , saying, Obey My voice, and do all which I command you; so shall ye be My people, and I will be your Elohim;"
Yirmeyah,11,5,"That I may perform the shevuah (oath) which I have sworn unto Avoteichem to give them an Eretz zavat cholov udevash as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, Omein, Hashem."
Yirmeyah,11,6,"Then Hashem said unto me, Proclaim all these Devarim in the towns of Yehudah, and in the streets of Yerushalayim, saying, Hear ye the Divrei HaBrit Hazot, and do them."
Yirmeyah,11,7,"For I earnestly warned Avoteichem in the day that I brought them up out of Eretz Mitzrayim, even unto this day, rising early and warning, saying, Obey My voice."
Yirmeyah,11,8,"Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ozen (ear) , but walked every one in the sherirut (stubbornness) of their lev harah; therefore I brought upon them all the Divrei HaBrit Hazot, which I commanded them to do; but they did them not."
Yirmeyah,11,9,"And Hashem said unto me, A kesher (conspiracy) is found among the Ish Yehudah, and among the inhabitants of Yerushalayim."
Yirmeyah,11,10,"They are turned back to the avonot Avotam HaRishonim, which refused to hear My words; and they went after elohim acherim to serve them; Bais Yisroel and Bais Yehudah have broken My Brit which I cut with Avotam."
Yirmeyah,11,11,"Therefore thus saith Hashem , Look! I will bring ra'ah (evil, disaster) upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry out unto Me, I will not pay heed unto them."
Yirmeyah,11,12,"Then shall the towns of Yehudah and inhabitants of Yerushalayim go, and cry out unto the elohim unto whom they offer ketoret; but they shall not save them at all in the time of their ra'ah (disaster)."
Yirmeyah,11,13,"For as many as the mispar (number) of thy towns were thy elohim, O Yehudah; and according to the mispar (number) of the streets of Yerushalayim have ye set up mizbechot to that boshet (shameful ), even mizbechot to burn ketoret unto Ba'al."
Yirmeyah,11,14,"Therefore pray not thou for HaAm Hazot, neither lift up a rinnah (entreaty) or tefillah on their behalf; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto Me for their ra'ah (disaster)."
Yirmeyah,11,15,"What hath My yadid (beloved) to do in Mine Bais, seeing she hath with rabbim (many) wrought clever [ritual] schemes ‚Äî can basar kodesh turn away from thee thy disaster, that thou can rejoice?"
Yirmeyah,11,16," Hashem called thy shem, A green zayit (olive tree) , yafeh, and of goodly pri (fruit) ; with the noise of a great tumult He hath kindled eish upon it, and the branches of it are broken."
Yirmeyah,11,17,"For Hashem Tzva'os, that planted thee, hath pronounced ra'ah against thee, for the evil of Bais Yisroel and of Bais Yehudah, which they have done against themselves to provoke Me to anger in offering ketoret (incense) unto Ba'al."
Yirmeyah,11,18,"And Hashem hath given me da'as (knowledge) of it, and I know it; then Thou opened my eyes to their deeds."
Yirmeyah,11,19,"But I was like an innocent keves (lamb) that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised machashavot (plots) against me, saying, Let us destroy the etz (tree) with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from Eretz Chayyim, that shmo may be no more remembered."
Yirmeyah,11,20,"But, Hashem Tzva'os, Shofet Tzedek, that testeth the kelayot (kidneys) and the lev, let me see Thy vengeance on them; for unto Thee have I committed my cause."
Yirmeyah,11,21,"Therefore thus saith Hashem of the anshei Anatot, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not B'Shem Hashem , that thou die not by our yad;"
Yirmeyah,11,22,"Therefore thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, Look! I will punish them; the bochurim shall die by the cherev; their banim and their banot shall die by ra'av (famine);"
Yirmeyah,11,23,"And there shall be no she'erit (remnant) of them; for I will bring ra'ah (evil) upon the Anshei Anatot, even the year of their visitation."
Yirmeyah,12,1,"Tzaddik art Thou, Hashem , when I make legal pleading of my case before Thee; yet mishpatim (justice) I would speak with Thee: Why doth the Derech Resha'im prosper? Why live they all at ease whose dealings are that of the boged (traitor, treacherous)?"
Yirmeyah,12,2,"Thou hast planted them, and they take root; they grow, and they bring forth pri; Thou art karov (near) in their mouth, and rachok (far) from their heart."
Yirmeyah,12,3,"But Thou, Hashem , knowest me; Thou hast seen me, and tested mine lev toward Thee; pull them out like tzon for the tevakh (slaughter) , and prepare them for the Yom Haregah (Day of Slaughter, Killing)."
Yirmeyah,12,4,"Ad mosai (until when) shall HaAretz mourn, and the esev kol hasadeh (grass of every field) wither, because of the wickedness of them that dwell therein? The behemot are consumed, and the oph; because they said, He is blind to our future."
Yirmeyah,12,5,"If thou hast run with the ragelim (footmen) , and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with susim? And if in the eretz shalom thou art complacent, then how wilt thou do in the thickets of the Yarden?"
Yirmeyah,12,6,"For even acheicha (thy brethren) , and the bais avicha, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; even they are in full cry behind thee; trust them not, though they speak unto thee tovot."
Yirmeyah,12,7,"I have forsaken Mine Bais, I have abandoned Mine nachalah; I have given the yedidut nafshi (the beloved of My soul) into the palm of her enemies."
Yirmeyah,12,8,Mine nachalah is unto Me as an aryeh in the ya'ar (forest) ; it roareth out against Me; therefore have I hated it.
Yirmeyah,12,9,"Mine nachalah is unto Me as a speckled bird of prey, the birds of prey round about are against her; come ye, assemble all the chayyat hasadeh (beasts of the field) , come to devour."
Yirmeyah,12,10,"Ro'im rabbim (many shepherds) have destroyed My kerem (vineyard) , they have trodden My chelek under foot, they have made My chelet chemdat (portion desired) a desolate midbar."
Yirmeyah,12,11,"They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto Me; kol HaAretz is made desolate, but no ish taketh it to heart."
Yirmeyah,12,12,The plunderers are come upon all barren heights in the midbar; for the Cherev Hashem shall devour from the one end of the Eretz even to the other end of HaAretz; no basar shall have shalom.
Yirmeyah,12,13,"They have sown chittim (wheat) , but shall reap kotzim (thorns) ; they have tired themselves out, but shall not profit; and they shall be ashamed of your harvests because of the Charon Af Hashem (burning furious wrath of Hashem)."
Yirmeyah,12,14,"Thus saith Hashem : Concerning all Mine evil shchenim (neighbors) , that touch the nachalah which I have caused My people Yisroel to inherit: See, I will uproot them out of their adamah, and uproot the Bais Yehudah from among them."
Yirmeyah,12,15,"And it shall come to pass, after that I uproot them I will return, and have rachamim (compassion) on them, and will bring them back again, every ish to his nachalah, and every ish to his eretz."
Yirmeyah,12,16,"And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the darkhei Ami (ways of My people ), to swear in My Shem, As Hashem liveth; even as they taught My people to make avowal in Ba'al; then shall they be built up in the midst of My People."
Yirmeyah,12,17,"But if they will not obey, I will utterly uproot and destroy that Goy (Nation) , saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,13,1,"Thus saith Hashem unto me, Go and buy thee a linen ezor (belt) and put it around thy waist, and put it not in mayim."
Yirmeyah,13,2,"So I bought the ezor (belt) according to the Devar Hashem , and put it around my waist."
Yirmeyah,13,3,"And the Devar Hashem came unto me the second time, saying,"
Yirmeyah,13,4,"Take the ezor that thou hast bought, which is around thy waist, and arise, go to Parah, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock."
Yirmeyah,13,5,"So I went, and hid it in Parah, as Hashem commanded me."
Yirmeyah,13,6,"And it came to pass at the end of yamim rabbim, that Hashem said unto me, Arise, go to Parah, and take the ezor from there, which I commanded thee to hide there."
Yirmeyah,13,7,"Then I went to Parah, and dug, and took the ezor from the makom where I had hid it; and, hinei, the ezor was marred, it was profitable for nothing."
Yirmeyah,13,8,"Then the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yirmeyah,13,9,"Thus saith Hashem , After this manner will I mar the ga'on Yehudah (pride of Judah) , and the great ga'on of Yerushalayim."
Yirmeyah,13,10,"This evil people, which refuse to listen to My words, which walk in the sherirut (stubbornness) of their lev, and walk after elohim acharim, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this ezor, which is good for nothing."
Yirmeyah,13,11,"For as the ezor has deveykus with the waist of an ish, so have I caused to have deveykus unto Me kol Bais Yisroel and kol Bais Yehudah, saith Hashem ; that they might be unto Me for a People, and for Shem, and for Tehillah, and for Teferet: but they would not hear."
Yirmeyah,13,12,"Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this Davar; Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Every wine jar shall be filled with yayin; and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every wine jar shall be filled with yayin?"
Yirmeyah,13,13,"Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith Hashem , Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of HaAretz Hazot, even the melachim that sit upon the kisse Dovid, and the Kohanim, and the Nevi'im, and all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, with shikkaron (drunkenness)."
Yirmeyah,13,14,"And I will dash them one against another, even the avot and the banim together, saith Hashem ; I will not pity, nor spare, nor have rachamim, but destroy them."
Yirmeyah,13,15,"Hear ye, and give ozen (ear) ; be not proud: for Hashem hath spoken."
Yirmeyah,13,16,"Give kavod to Hashem Eloheichem, before He cause darkness, and before your raglayim stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for ohr, He turn it into the tzalmavet (shadow of death) , and make it gross darkness."
Yirmeyah,13,17,"But if ye will not listen, my nefesh shall weep in secret places for your ga'avah (pride) ; and mine eye shall weep profusely, and run down with tears, because the Eder Hashem (Flock of Hashem) is carried away captive."
Yirmeyah,13,18,"Say unto HaMelech and to the Gevirah (Queen mother) , Humble yourselves, sit down; for your rule shall come down, even the ateret (crown) of your tiferet (glory)."
Yirmeyah,13,19,"The cities of the Negev shall be shut up, and none shall open them; Yehudah shall be all carried away into the Golus, it shall be wholly carried away into the Golus."
Yirmeyah,13,20,"Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the tzafon (north) . Where is the eder (flock) that was given thee, thy tzon tiferet?"
Yirmeyah,13,21,"What wilt thou say when He appoints over thy leaders those whom thou thyself has taught, to be thy rosh? Shall not chavalim (pangs) seize thee, as a woman in travail?"
Yirmeyah,13,22,"And if thou say in thine lev, Why come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine avon (iniquity) are thy skirts uncovered, and thy heels violated."
Yirmeyah,13,23,"Can the Cushi (Ethiopian) change his ohr (skin) , or the namer (leopard) his spots? Then may ye also do tov, that are accustomed to do rah."
Yirmeyah,13,24,Therefore will I scatter them as the chaff driven by the ruach of the midbar.
Yirmeyah,13,25,"This is thy goral (lot) , the portion of thy measures from Me, saith Hashem ; because thou hast forgotten Me, and trusted in sheker (falsehood)."
Yirmeyah,13,26,"Therefore will I uncover thy skirts over thy panim, that thy shame may appear."
Yirmeyah,13,27,"I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy zenut (whoredom) , and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Yerushalayim! Wilt thou not be made tahor (clean) ? Until when?"
Yirmeyah,14,1,The Davar Hashem that came to Yirmeyah concerning the batzorot (droughts).
Yirmeyah,14,2,"Yehudah mourneth, and the she'arim (gates), thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Yerushalayim is gone up."
Yirmeyah,14,3,"And their nobles have sent their servants for mayim; they came to the cisterns, and found no mayim; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and dismayed, and covered their rosh."
Yirmeyah,14,4,"Because the adamah is cracked, for there was no geshem in the earth, the ikkarim (plowmen) were ashamed, they covered their rosh."
Yirmeyah,14,5,"Indeed, the deer also calved in the sadeh, and forsook it, because there was no desheh (grass)."
Yirmeyah,14,6,"And the pera'im (wild donkeys) did stand on the bare heights, they pant for ruach like jackals; their eyes did fail, because there was no esev (grass)."
Yirmeyah,14,7," Hashem , though avoneinu (our iniquities) testify against us, do Thou it l'ama'an (for the sake of) Shemecha (Thy Name) ; for meshuvoteinu (our backslidings) are great; we have sinned against Thee."
Yirmeyah,14,8,"O Mikveh Yisroel, the Moshi'a thereof in time of tzoros, why shouldest Thou be as a ger (stranger) in HaAretz, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?"
Yirmeyah,14,9,"Why shouldest Thou be as an ish astonished, as a gibbor that cannot save? Yet Thou, Hashem , art in the midst of us, and we are called by Thy Shem; forsake us not."
Yirmeyah,14,10,"Thus saith Hashem unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not restrained their raglayim, therefore Hashem doth not accept them; He will now remember their avon (iniquity) , and visit their sins."
Yirmeyah,14,11,"Then said Hashem unto me, Pray not for HaAm Hazeh for their tovah (well-being)."
Yirmeyah,14,12,"When they undergo a tzom, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer olah (burnt offering) and minchah (grain offering) , I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the cherev, and by the ra'av (famine) , and by dever (pestilence)."
Yirmeyah,14,13,"Then said I, Ah, Adonoi Hashem ! Hinei, the nevi'im say unto them, Ye shall not see the cherev, neither shall ye have ra'av (famine) ; but I will give you shalom emes in this makom."
Yirmeyah,14,14,"Then Hashem said unto me, The nevi'im prophesy sheker in My Shem; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke unto them; they prophesy unto you a chazon sheker (false vision) and kesem (divination, pagan fortunetelling) , and a worthless thing, and the delusion of their lev."
Yirmeyah,14,15,"Therefore thus saith Hashem concerning the nevi'im that prophesy in My Shem, and I sent them not, yet they say, Cherev and ra'av (famine) shall not be in HaAretz Hazot; By cherev and ra'av (famine) shall those nevi'im be consumed."
Yirmeyah,14,16,"And HaAm to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Yerushalayim because of the ra'av (famine) and the cherev; and they shall have none to bury them ‚Äî them, their nashim, nor their banim, nor their banot; for I will pour out their ra'ah (wickedness, disaster) upon them."
Yirmeyah,14,17,"Therefore thou shalt say this davar unto them, Let mine eyes run down with tears lailah and yomam, and let them not cease: for the Betulat Bat Ami is broken with a shever gadol (great calamity) , with a severe wound."
Yirmeyah,14,18,"If I go forth into the sadeh, then hinei! The slain with the cherev! And if I enter into the Ir, then hinei them that are ravaged with ra'av (famine) ! Indeed, both the navi and the kohen go roaming to a land that they know not."
Yirmeyah,14,19,"Hast Thou utterly rejected Yehudah? Hath Thy nefesh loathed Tziyon? Why hast Thou afflicted us, and there is no healing for us? We hoped for shalom, and there is no tov; and for the time of healing, and hinei terror!"
Yirmeyah,14,20,"We acknowledge, Hashem , our wickedness, and the avon Avoteinu; for we have sinned against Thee."
Yirmeyah,14,21,"Do not abhor us, for the sake of Shimecha, do not disgrace the Kisse Kevodecha (throne of Thy glory) ; remember, annul not Thy Brit with us."
Yirmeyah,14,22,"Are there any among the havalim (vanities, false g-ds) of the Goyim that can cause geshem? Or can HaShomayim give showers? Art not Thou He, Hashem Eloheinu? Therefore we will hope in and wait upon Thee; for Thou hast made all these things."
Yirmeyah,15,1,"Then said Hashem unto me, Though Moshe and Shmuel stood before Me, yet My Nefesh could not be toward HaAm Hazeh; cast them out of My sight, and let them go forth."
Yirmeyah,15,2,"And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Where shall we go forth? Then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith Hashem : Such as are for mavet, to mavet; and such as are for the cherev, to the cherev; and such as are for the ra'av (famine) , to the ra'av (famine) ; and such as are for shevi (captivity, Golus) to the shevi."
Yirmeyah,15,3,"And I will appoint over them four mishpechot (families, categories ), saith Hashem ; the cherev to slay, and the kelevim to drag off, and the oph HaShomayim, and the behemat ha'aretz, to devour and destroy."
Yirmeyah,15,4,"And I will cause them to be a horrific sight to kol mamlechot ha'aretz, because of Menasheh Ben Yechizkiyahu Melech Yehudah, for that which he did in Yerushalayim."
Yirmeyah,15,5,"For who shall have pity upon thee, O Yerushalayim? Or who shall mourn thee? Or who shall go aside to inquire regarding the shalom of thee?"
Yirmeyah,15,6,"Thou hast forsaken Me, saith Hashem , thou keepeth going backward; therefore will I stretch out My yad against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with relenting."
Yirmeyah,15,7,"And I will winnow them with a mizreh (winnowing fork) in the sha'arei ha'aretz; I will bereave them, I will destroy My people since they turn not from their drakhim."
Yirmeyah,15,8,"Their almanot (widows) are increased before Me above the chol (sand) of the seas; I have brought upon them, against the em bochur (mother of youth) , a shoded (plunderer) at noonday; I let fall upon her suddenly, Ir and terrors."
Yirmeyah,15,9,"She that bore shivah (seven) [sons] languisheth; she hath gasped for her nefesh; her shemesh is gone down while it was yet day; she hath been humiliated and disgraced; and the she'erit (remnant) of them will I deliver to the cherev before their oyevim, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,15,10,"Oy li, immi, that thou bore me, an ish riv (a man of strife) and an ish madon (a man of contention) to kol ha'aretz (the whole land) ! I have neither lent, neither have any lent to me; yet every one of them doth curse me."
Yirmeyah,15,11," Hashem said, Verily I will deliver thee for tov; verily I will cause the oyev (enemy) to supplicate thee in the time of ra'ah and in the time of tzarah (distress)."
Yirmeyah,15,12,"Shall barzel (iron) break, barzel (iron) from tzafon (north) ? Or nechoshet?"
Yirmeyah,15,13,"Thy wealth and thy otzerot (treasures) will I give as plunder without mekhir (price) , and that for all thy chataim (sins) , even in all thy territories."
Yirmeyah,15,14,"And I will make thee to pass over thine oyevim (enemies) into an eretz which thou knowest not; for eish is kindled in Mine anger, which shall burn against you."
Yirmeyah,15,15," Hashem , Thou knowest; remember me, and visit me, and take vengeance for me of my [pursuing] persecutors; in Thy patient forbearance take me not away; know that for Thy sake I have suffered cherpah (reproach)."
Yirmeyah,15,16,"Thy Devarim were found, and I did eat them; and Thy Davar was unto me the sasson and simchat levavi; for I am called by Thy Shem, Hashem Elohei Tzva'os."
Yirmeyah,15,17,"I sat not in the sod (company) of merrymakers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of Thy yad; for Thou hast filled me with za'am (indignation)."
Yirmeyah,15,18,"Why is my pain netzach (perpetual, never ending) and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? Wilt Thou be altogether unto me like achzav (deception) and mayim lo ne'emanu (waters that have not proved reliable)?"
Yirmeyah,15,19,"Therefore thus saith Hashem , If thou make teshuva (repentance) , then will I restore thee, and thou shalt stand before Me; and if thou bring forth [utterance] of the precious rather than the worthless, thou shalt be as My Peh (Mouth) : let them turn unto thee; but turn not thou unto them."
Yirmeyah,15,20,"And I will make thee unto HaAm Hazeh (this people) a fortified chomat nechoshet; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,15,21,"And I will save thee out of the yad of the ra'im (wicked) , and I will redeem thee out of the clutches of the ruthless."
Yirmeyah,16,1,"The Davar Hashem came also unto me, saying,"
Yirmeyah,16,2,"Thou shalt not take thee an isha, neither shalt thou have banim or banot in makom hazeh (this place)."
Yirmeyah,16,3,"For thus saith Hashem concerning the banim and concerning the banot that are born in makom hazeh, and concerning their immahot (mothers) that bore them, and concerning their avot that fathered them in ha'aretz hazot (this land);"
Yirmeyah,16,4,"The mot (death) they die will be of deadly diseases; they shall not be mourned; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as refuse upon the face of ha'adamah; and they shall be consumed by the cherev, and by ra'av (famine) ; and their nevelot (dead bodies) shall be food for the oph haShomayim, and for the behemat ha'aretz."
Yirmeyah,16,5,"For thus saith Hashem , Enter not into the bais marzeach (house of mourning) , neither go to lament nor mourn them; for I have withdrawn away My shalom from HaAm Hazeh, saith Hashem , even chesed and rachamim."
Yirmeyah,16,6,"Both the gedolim and the ketanim shall die in ha'aretz hazot; they shall not be buried, neither shall men mourn for them, nor make [pagan] cuttings on themselves, nor make themselves [like pagan mourners] bald for them:"
Yirmeyah,16,7,"Neither shall men break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the kos tanechumim (cup of consolation) to drink for their av or for their em."
Yirmeyah,16,8,"Thou shalt not go into the bais mishteh (house of feasting) , to sit with them to eat and to drink."
Yirmeyah,16,9,"For thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Behold, I will cause to cease out of hamakom hazeh before your eyes, and in your days, the voice of sasson, and the voice of simcha, the voice of the choson, and the voice of the kallah."
Yirmeyah,16,10,"And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt tell this people all these Devarim, and they shall say unto thee, Why hath Hashem pronounced all this ra'ah hagedolah against us? Or what is avoneinu (our iniquity) ? Or what is chattateinu (our sin) that we have committed against Hashem Eloheinu?"
Yirmeyah,16,11,"Then shalt thou say unto them, Because avoteichem have forsaken Me, saith Hashem , and have walked after acharei elohim, and have served them, and have worshiped them, and have forsaken Me, and have not been shomer over My torah;"
Yirmeyah,16,12,"And ye have done more wickedly than avoteichem; for, behold, ye walk every one after the sherirut (stubbornness) of his lev harah, that they may not pay heed unto Me:"
Yirmeyah,16,13,"Therefore will I cast you out of ha'aretz hazot into ha'aretz that ye know not, neither ye nor avoteichem; and there shall ye serve elohim acherim yomam valailah; for I will not show you chaninah (favor)."
Yirmeyah,16,14,"Therefore, hinei, the days come, saith Hashem , that it shall no more be said, Hashem liveth, that brought up the Bnei Yisroel out of Eretz Mitzrayim;"
Yirmeyah,16,15,"But, Hashem liveth, that brought up the Bnei Yisroel from the eretz tzaphon, and from kol ha'aratz where He had dispersed them; and I will bring them again into their adamah that I gave unto their avot."
Yirmeyah,16,16,"Behold, I will send for many dayagim (fisherman) , saith Hashem , and they shall fish them out; and after that will I send for many tzayadim (hunters) , and they shall hunt them from every har (mountain) , and from every givah (hill) , and out of the crevices of the sela'im (rocks)."
Yirmeyah,16,17,"For Mine eyes are upon all their drakhim; they are not hid from My face, neither is their avon (iniquity) hid from Mine eyes."
Yirmeyah,16,18,"And first I will recompense their avon (iniquity) and their sin mishneh (double) ; because they have defiled My Eretz (land) , they have filled Mine nachalah with the nevelot (lifeless forms, carcasses) of their detestable and abominable idols."
Yirmeyah,16,19," Hashem , my strength, and my ma'oz (fortress) , and my refuge in the yom tzarah, the Goyim shall come unto Thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely Avoteinu have inherited sheker, hevel, and things wherein there is no profit."
Yirmeyah,16,20,Shall man make elohim unto himself and they are not Elohim?
Yirmeyah,16,21,"Therefore, Behold, I will this time cause them to know, I will cause them to know Mine yad and My gevurah; and they shall know that My Shem is Hashem."
Yirmeyah,17,1,"The chattat Yehudah is written with an et barzel (iron pen) , and with the tzipporen shamir (point of a diamond) ; it is engraved upon the luach (tablet) of their lev, and upon the karenot (horns) of your mizbechot (altars);"
Yirmeyah,17,2,Whilst their banim remember their mizbechot and their asherim by the leafy trees upon the high hills.
Yirmeyah,17,3,"O My mountain in the sadeh, I will give over thy wealth and all thy otzerot (treasures) as plunder, and thy high places for sin, throughout all thy territories."
Yirmeyah,17,4,"And thou, even thyself, shalt let go of thine nachalah that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine oyevim in ha'aretz which thou knowest not; for ye have kindled an eish in Mine anger, which shall burn ad-olam (forever)."
Yirmeyah,17,5,"Thus saith Hashem : Arur (cursed) be the gever that trusteth in adam, and maketh basar his zero'a, and whose lev turneth away from Hashem."
Yirmeyah,17,6,"For he shall be like the shrub in the aravah (desert) , and shall not see when tov cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the midbar, in an eretz melechah (salt land) and not inhabited."
Yirmeyah,17,7,"Baruch hagever asher yivtach ba Hashem (Blessed is the man that trusteth in Hashem) , and whose mivtach (confidence) Hashem is."
Yirmeyah,17,8,"For he shall be as an etz planted by the mayim, and that spreadeth out her shorashim (roots) by the brook, and shall not fear when chom (heat) cometh, but its leaf shall be green; and shall not be anxious in the shenat batzoret (year of drought) , neither shall cease from yielding p'ri (fruit)."
Yirmeyah,17,9,"The lev (heart, mind) akov (is deceitful) above all things, and anush (incurable); who can know it?"
Yirmeyah,17,10,"I, Hashem , search the lev, I test the kelayot (kidneys), requiting to every ish according to his drakhim, and according to the p'ri of his deeds."
Yirmeyah,17,11,"As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth osher (riches) , and not by mishpat, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a naval (fool)."
Yirmeyah,17,12,A glorious high kisse from the beginning is the place of Mikdasheinu (our Beis HaMikdash).
Yirmeyah,17,13," Hashem , the Mikveh Yisroel, all that forsake Thee shall be put to shame, and they that turn away from Me shall be written down in ha'aretz, because they have forsaken Hashem , the Makor Mayim Chayyim (Fountain of Living Waters)."
Yirmeyah,17,14,"Heal me, Hashem , and I shall be healed; hoshi'eini (save me) , and I shall be saved; for Thou art my tehillah (praise)."
Yirmeyah,17,15,"Hinei, they say unto me, Where is the Devar Hashem ? Let it come now."
Yirmeyah,17,16,"As for me, I have not hastened away from being a ro'eh (shepherd) to follow Thee; neither did I lust for the woeful day; Thou knowest; that which came out of my lips was before Thee."
Yirmeyah,17,17,"Be not a mechittah (terror) unto me; Thou art my refuge in the Yom Ra'ah (Day of Evil, Day of Disaster, Day of Doom)."
Yirmeyah,17,18,"Let them be ashamed that persecute me, but let not me be put to shame; let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed; bring upon them the Yom Ra'ah, and destroy them with mishneh (double) destruction."
Yirmeyah,17,19,"Thus said Hashem unto me; Go and stand in the Sha'ar Bnei HaAm, whereby the melachim of Yehudah come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the Sha'arei Yerushalayim;"
Yirmeyah,17,20,"And say unto them, Hear ye the Devar Hashem , ye melachim of Yehudah, and all Yehudah, and all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, that enter in by these she'arim (gates);"
Yirmeyah,17,21,"Thus saith Hashem : Be shomer over your nefashot, and bear no massa (burden) on Shabbos, nor bring through the Sha'arei Yerushalayim;"
Yirmeyah,17,22,"Neither carry forth a massa (burden) out of your batim (houses) on Shabbos, neither do ye any melachah (work) , but keep Shabbos set apart as kodesh, just as I commanded Avoteichem."
Yirmeyah,17,23,"But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ozen (ear) , but made their stubborn neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive musar (discipline)."
Yirmeyah,17,24,"And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently pay heed unto Me, saith Hashem , to bring in no massa (burden) through the she'arim (gates) of this city on the day of Shabbos, but keep the day of Shabbos holy, to do no melachah (work) therein;"
Yirmeyah,17,25,"Then shall there enter into the she'arim (gates) of this city melachim and sarim sitting upon the kisse Dovid, riding in chariots and on susim, they, and their sarim, the Ish Yehudah, and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim; and this city shall be inhabited l'olam (forever)."
Yirmeyah,17,26,"And they shall come from the towns of Yehudah, and from the places around Yerushalayim, and from Eretz Binyamin, and from the Shephalah (Lowlands) , and from the har (hill country) , and from the Negev bringing olah (burnt offering) , and zevach (sacrifice) , and minchah (grain offering) , and levonah (frankincense) , and bringing todah (thank offering) , unto the Bais Hashem."
Yirmeyah,17,27,"But if ye will not pay heed unto Me to keep the day of Shabbos holy, and not to bear a massa (burden) , when entering in at the She'arim of Yerushalayim on the day of Shabbos; then will I kindle an eish in the she'arim thereof, and it shall devour the fortresses of Yerushalayim, and it shall not be quenched."
Yirmeyah,18,1,"The Davar which came to Yirmeyah from Hashem , saying,"
Yirmeyah,18,2,"Arise, and go down to the bais hayotzer (the house of the potter, Creator) , and there I will cause thee to hear My Devar."
Yirmeyah,18,3,"Then I went down to the bais hayotzer, and, behold, he wrought a work on the [potter ºs] wheel."
Yirmeyah,18,4,"And the keli (vessel) that he was making of khomer (clay) was marred in the yad of the yotzer; so he made it again keli acher (another vessel, a different vessel) , as seemed good to the eyes of the yotzer to make it."
Yirmeyah,18,5,"Then the Devar Hashem came to me, saying,"
Yirmeyah,18,6,"O Bais Yisroel, cannot I do with you as this yotzer? saith Hashem . Hinei, as the khomer (clay) is in the yotzer ºs yad, so are ye in Mine yad, O Bais Yisroel."
Yirmeyah,18,7,"At what instant I shall speak concerning a Goy (nation) , and concerning a mamlachah (kingdom) , to uproot, and to pull down, and to destroy it;"
Yirmeyah,18,8,"If that Goy, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their ra'ah, I will relent of the ra'ah that I planned to do unto them."
Yirmeyah,18,9,"And at what instant I shall speak concerning a Goy, and concerning a mamlachah, to build and to plant it;"
Yirmeyah,18,10,"If it do ra'ah in My sight, that it obey not My voice, then I will relent of the tov, wherewith I said I would benefit them."
Yirmeyah,18,11,"Now therefore go to, speak to the Ish Yehudah, and to the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, saying, Thus saith Hashem ; Hinei, I yotzer (mold as a potter) ra'ah against you, and devise a plan against you; return ye now every ish from his derech ra'ah, and make your ways and your doings good."
Yirmeyah,18,12,"And they said, It is useless; but we will walk according to our own plans, and we will every ish do the sherirut (stubbornness) of his lev ra'ah."
Yirmeyah,18,13,"Therefore thus saith Hashem , Ask ye now among the Goyim, Who hath heard such things? The Betulat Yisroel hath done a most horrible thing."
Yirmeyah,18,14,Does the sheleg (snow) of Levanon vanish from the tzur of the slope? Or shall the cold flowing mayim that come from distant sources cease?
Yirmeyah,18,15,"Because My people hath forgotten Me, they have burned ketoret to worthless idols, and they have caused them to stumble in their drakhim from the ancient paths, to walk in bypaths, and not on the derech built up;"
Yirmeyah,18,16,"To make their eretz desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and shall shake his rosh."
Yirmeyah,18,17,"I will scatter them as with an east ruach (wind) before the oyev; I will show them My oref (back) , and not My panim (face) , in the day of their calamity."
Yirmeyah,18,18,"Then said they, Come and let us devise plans against Yirmeyah; for the torah shall not perish from the kohen, nor etzah from the chacham, nor the davar from the navi. Come, and let us attack him with the lashon, and let us not give heed to any of his devarim."
Yirmeyah,18,19,"Give heed to me, Hashem , and take notice of the voice of them that contend with me."
Yirmeyah,18,20,"Shall ra'ah be repaid for tovah? For they have dug a pit for my nefesh. Remember that I stood before Thee to speak tovah concerning them, and to turn away Thy wrath from them."
Yirmeyah,18,21,"Therefore deliver up their banim to the ra'av (famine) , and pour out their dahm by the force of the cherev; and let their nashim be bereaved as childless, and be almanot (widows) ; and let their anashim be put to death; let their bochurim be slain by the cherev in milchamah."
Yirmeyah,18,22,"Let a cry be heard from their batim (houses) , when Thou shalt bring a gedud (troop) suddenly upon them; for they have dug a pit to take me, and hid pachim (snares) for my raglayim."
Yirmeyah,18,23,"Yet, Hashem , Thou knowest all their etzah against me to slay me; do not make kapporah for their avon, neither blot out their chattat from Thy sight, but let them be overthrown before Thee; deal thus with them in the time of Thine anger."
Yirmeyah,19,1,"Thus saith Hashem , Go and acquire a yotzer ºs earthen jar, and take some of the Ziknei HaAm, and of the Ziknei HaKohanim;"
Yirmeyah,19,2,"And go forth unto the Gey Ben-Hinnom, which is by the petach (entrance) of the Potsherd Gate, and proclaim there the Devarim that I shall tell thee,"
Yirmeyah,19,3,"And say, Hear ye the Devar Hashem , O melachim of Yehudah, and inhabitants of Yerushalayim; Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, the Elohei Yisroel; Behold, I will bring ra'ah upon this makom, the which whosoever heareth, his oznayim shall tingle."
Yirmeyah,19,4,"Because they have forsaken Me, and have made this an alien place, and have burned [offerings] in it unto elohim acherim, whom neither they nor avoteihem have known, nor the melachim of Yehudah, and have filled this makom with the dahm of innocents;"
Yirmeyah,19,5,"They have built also the high places of Ba'al, to burn their banim with eish for olot unto Ba'al, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into My lev;"
Yirmeyah,19,6,"Therefore, hinei, the days come, saith Hashem , that this makom shall no more be called Tophet, nor Gey Ben-Hinnom, but The Valley of Slaughter."
Yirmeyah,19,7,"And I will make void the etzah of Yehudah and Yerushalayim in this makom; and I will cause them to fall by the cherev before their oyevim, and by the hands of them that seek their nefesh; and their nevelah (carcasses) will I give to be food for the oph HaShomayim, and for the behemat ha'aretz."
Yirmeyah,19,8,"And I will make this city desolate, and an object of hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the makkot (plagues) thereof."
Yirmeyah,19,9,"And I will cause them to eat the basar of their banim and the basar of their banot, and they shall eat every one the basar of his re'a in the siege and desperation, wherewith their oyevim, and they that seek their nefesh, shall drive them to despair."
Yirmeyah,19,10,"Then shalt thou break the earthen jar in the sight of the anashim that go with thee,"
Yirmeyah,19,11,"And shalt say unto them, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a yotzer ºs vessel, that cannot be made whole again; and they shall bury them in Tophet, until there be no makom (place, room) to bury."
Yirmeyah,19,12,"Thus will I do unto this makom, saith Hashem , and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet;"
Yirmeyah,19,13,"And the batim (houses) of Yerushalayim, and the batim (houses) of the melachim of Yehudah, shall be tameh as the makom of Tophet, because of all the batim (houses) upon whose roofs they have burned ketoret unto all the Tzeva HaShomayim, and have poured out nesakhim (drink offerings) unto elohim acherim."
Yirmeyah,19,14,"Then came Yirmeyah from Tophet, from where Hashem had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the khatzer (courtyard) of the Beis Hashem ; and said to kol HaAm,"
Yirmeyah,19,15,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel; Hineni, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns kol hara'ah that I have pronounced against it, because they have stiffened their necks, that they might not hear My Devarim."
Yirmeyah,20,1,"Now Pashchur Ben Immer the kohen, who was also Pakid Nagid in the Beis Hashem , heard that Yirmeyah prophesied these things."
Yirmeyah,20,2,"Then Pashchur struck Yirmeyah HaNavi, and put him in the stocks that were in the Upper Gate of Binyamin, which was at the Beis Hashem."
Yirmeyah,20,3,"And it came to pass on the next day, that Pashchur brought forth Yirmeyah out of the stocks. Then said Yirmeyah unto him, Hashem hath not called thy shem Pashchur, but Magor Missaviv (Terror on Every Side)."
Yirmeyah,20,4,"For thus saith Hashem , Hineni, I will make thee a magor (terror) to thyself, and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the cherev of their oyevim, and thine eynayim shall behold it; and I will give kol Yehudah into the yad Melech Bavel, and he shall carry them captive into Bavel, and shall slay them with the cherev."
Yirmeyah,20,5,"Moreover, I will deliver all the wealth of this city, and all the produce thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the otzarot of the melachim of Yehudah will I give into the yad of their oyevim, which shall plunder them, and seize them, and carry them to Bavel."
Yirmeyah,20,6,"And thou, Pashchur, and all that dwell in thine bais shall go into the [Golus] captivity: and thou shalt come to Bavel, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied sheker."
Yirmeyah,20,7," Hashem , Thou hast induced me, and I was induced; Thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed; I am a laughingstock all day long, every one mocketh me."
Yirmeyah,20,8,"For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried chamas and destruction; because the Devar Hashem was made a cherpah (reproach) unto me, and a derision, all day long."
Yirmeyah,20,9,"Then I said, I will not make mention of Him, nor speak any more in Shmo. But His word was in Mine lev as a burning eish shut up in my atzmot, and I was weary of holding back, and I could not."
Yirmeyah,20,10,"For I heard the slander of many, Magor (terror) on every side. Report, say they, let ºs report him. Kol enosh shelomi watched for my stumbling, saying, Perhaps he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him."
Yirmeyah,20,11,"But Hashem is with me as a Gibbor Aritz (Mighty Warrior) : therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not succeed; their kelimat olam (everlasting dishonor) shall never be forgotten."
Yirmeyah,20,12,"But, Hashem Tzva'os, that tests the tzaddik, and seest the kelayot and the lev, let me see Thy vengeance on them; for unto Thee have I pled my cause."
Yirmeyah,20,13,"Sing unto Hashem , hallelu Hashem ; for He hath saved the nefesh of the evyon (poor) from the yad of evildoers."
Yirmeyah,20,14,Arur (cursed) be the day wherein I was born; let not the day wherein immi bore me yehi baruch (be blessed).
Yirmeyah,20,15,"Arur (cursed) be the ish who brought news to avi, saying, A ben zachar (male child) is born unto thee; making him very glad."
Yirmeyah,20,16,"And let that ish be as the towns which Hashem overthrew, and relented not; and let him hear the wailing in the boker, and the teru'ah (battle cry) at noontide;"
Yirmeyah,20,17,"Because he slaughtered me not from the womb; or that immi might have been my kever, and olam (forever) her womb enlarged."
Yirmeyah,20,18,"Why came I forth out of the womb to see amal (trouble, toil) and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?"
Yirmeyah,21,1,"The Davar which came unto Yirmeyah from Hashem , when HaMelech Tzidkiyah sent unto him Pashchur Ben Malkiyah, and Tzephanyah Ben Ma'aseiyah the kohen, saying,"
Yirmeyah,21,2,"Inquire, now, of Hashem for us; for Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel maketh war against us; if it be so that Hashem will deal with us according to all His nifle'ot (wondrous deeds) , that he may withdraw from us."
Yirmeyah,21,3,"Then said Yirmeyah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Tzidkiyah;"
Yirmeyah,21,4,"Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel; Hineni, I will turn back against you the weapons of milchamah (war) that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against Melech Bavel, and against the Kasdim (Chaldeans) , which besiege you outside the chomah (wall) , and I will assemble them inside this city."
Yirmeyah,21,5,"And I Myself will fight against you with an outstretched yad (hand) and with a zero'a chazakah (strong arm) , even in anger, and in chemah, and in ketzef gadol (great wrath)."
Yirmeyah,21,6,"And I will strike down the inhabitants of this city, both ha'adam and habehemah; they shall die of dever gadol (great plague)."
Yirmeyah,21,7,"And afterward, saith Hashem , I will deliver Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah, and his avadim, and HaAm, and such as are survivors in this city from dever, from the cherev, and from the ra'av (famine) , into the yad Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel, and into the yad of their oyevim (enemies) , and into the yad of those that seek their nefesh; and he shall strike them down with the edge of the cherev; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have rachamim."
Yirmeyah,21,8,"And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith Hashem ; Hineni, I set before you the Derech HaChayyim and the Derech HaMavet."
Yirmeyah,21,9,"He that abideth in this city shall die by cherev, and by ra'av (famine) , and by dever (plague) ; but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Kasdim (Chaldeans) that besiege you, he shall live, and his nefesh shall be unto him as plunder."
Yirmeyah,21,10,"For I have set my face against this city for ra'ah, and not for tovah, saith Hashem ; it shall be given into the yad Melech Bavel, and he shall set eish to it to burn it down."
Yirmeyah,21,11,"And touching the Bais Melech Yehudah, say, Hear ye the Devar Hashem;"
Yirmeyah,21,12,"O Bais Dovid, thus saith Hashem ; Execute mishpat in the boker, and save him that is robbed out of the yad oshek (hand of the oppressor) , lest My chemah (fury) go out like eish, and burn that none can quench it, because of the wickedness of your deeds."
Yirmeyah,21,13,"Hineni, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the emek (valley) , and tzur (rock) of the plain, saith Hashem ; which say, Who shall come down against us? Or who shall enter into our me'onot (dwelling places, homes)?"
Yirmeyah,21,14,"But I will visit you in punishment according to the p'ri (fruit) of your deeds, saith Hashem ; and I will kindle an eish in the ya'ar (forest) thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it."
Yirmeyah,22,1,"Thus saith Hashem ; Go down to the Bais Melech Yehudah, and speak there this Davar,"
Yirmeyah,22,2,"And say, Hear the Devar Hashem , O Melech Yehudah, that sittest upon the kisse of Dovid, thou, and thy avadim, and thy people that enter in by these she'arim (gates);"
Yirmeyah,22,3,"Thus saith Hashem ; Execute ye mishpat (justice) and tzedakah (righteousness) , and save the plundered out of the yad of the oshek (oppressor) ; and do no wrong, do no violence to the ger (alien) , the yatom (orphan) , nor the almanah (widow) , neither shed dahm naki (innocent blood) in this makom (place)."
Yirmeyah,22,4,"For if ye carry out this davar indeed, then, shall there enter in by the she'arim (gates) of this Bais, melachim sitting upon the kisse Dovid, riding in chariots and on susim, he, and his avadim, and his people."
Yirmeyah,22,5,"But if ye will not hear these devarim, I swear a shevuah by Myself, saith Hashem , that this Bais shall become a desolation."
Yirmeyah,22,6,"For thus saith Hashem unto the Bais Melech Yehudah: Thou art [in grandeur] Gil'ad unto Me, and the summit of the Levanon; yet surely I will make thee a midbar, and towns which are not inhabited."
Yirmeyah,22,7,"And I will prepare mashchitim (destroyers) against thee, every ish with his weapons; and they shall cut down thy choice arazim (cedars) , and cast them into the eish."
Yirmeyah,22,8,"And Goyim rabbim shall pass by this city, and they shall say every ish to his re'a (neighbor) , Why hath Hashem done thus unto this ir hagedolah (great city)?"
Yirmeyah,22,9,"Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the Brit Hashem Eloheihem, and worshiped elohim acherim, and served them."
Yirmeyah,22,10,"Weep ye not for the one dead, neither mourn him; but weep bitterly for him that goeth away [into the Golus]; for he shall return no more, nor see his eretz moledet (native land)."
Yirmeyah,22,11,"For thus saith Hashem touching Shallum Ben Yoshiyah Melech Yehudah, which reigned in place of Yoshiyah aviv, which went forth out of this makom; he shall not return there any more;"
Yirmeyah,22,12,"But he shall die in the makom where they have led him captive [into the Golus], and he shall see HaAretz Hazot no more."
Yirmeyah,22,13,"Woe unto him that buildeth his bais but not by tzedek (righteousness) , and his aliyyot (upper chambers) but not by mishpat; that useth his neighbor ºs service without wages, and giveth him no pay for his work;"
Yirmeyah,22,14,"That saith, I will build me a large bais (mansion) and spacious aliyyot (upper rooms) , and cutteth him out chalonot (windows) ; and panel it with erez (cedar) , and paint with bright red."
Yirmeyah,22,15,"Shalt thou reign, because thou enclose thyself in erez (cedar) ? Did not Avicha eat and drink, and do mishpat and tzedakah, and then it was tov (well) with him?"
Yirmeyah,22,16,He defended the cause of the oni (poor) and evyon (needy) ; then it was tov (well) with him; was not this to have da'as of Me? saith Hashem.
Yirmeyah,22,17,"But thine eynayim (eyes) and thine lev are but for thy betza (covetousness, greed) and for to shed dahm hanaki (innocent blood) , and for oshek (oppression) , and for merutzah (extortion, persecution) , to do it."
Yirmeyah,22,18,"Therefore thus saith Hashem concerning Y'hoyakim Ben Yoshiyah Melech Yehudah: They shall not mourn for him, saying, Ah achi! Or, Ah achot (sister) ! They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah adon! Or, Ah his hod (glory)!"
Yirmeyah,22,19,"He shall be buried with the kevurat chamor (burial of a donkey) , dragged and cast forth outside the Sha'arei Yerushalayim."
Yirmeyah,22,20,"Go up to the Levanon, and cry out; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry out from Avarim; for all thy lovers are crushed."
Yirmeyah,22,21,"I spoke unto thee in thy security; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy derech from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not My kol (voice)."
Yirmeyah,22,22,"The ruach shall eat up all thy ro'im (rulers) , and thy lovers shall go into captivity [in the Golus]; surely then shalt thou be ashamed and humiliated because of all thy wickedness."
Yirmeyah,22,23,"O inhabitant of the Levanon, that makest thy ken (nest) in the arazim (cedars) , how shalt thou groan when chavalim (birth pangs) come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!"
Yirmeyah,22,24,"As I live, saith Hashem , though Konyahu Ben Y'hoyakim Melech Yehudah were the chotam (signet ring) upon Yad Yemini (My right Hand) , yet would I pluck thee from there."
Yirmeyah,22,25,"And I will give thee into the yad of them that seek thy nefesh, and into the yad of them of whom thou art afraid, even into the yad of Nevukhadretzar Melech Babylon, and into the yad of the Kasdim."
Yirmeyah,22,26,"And I will cast thee out, and immecha that bore thee, into ha'aretz acheret (another country) , where ye were not born; and there shall ye die."
Yirmeyah,22,27,"But to HaAretz whereunto they desire to return, to these shall they not return."
Yirmeyah,22,28,"Is this man Konyahu a despised broken etzev (image, statue) ? Is he a vessel wherein is no chefetz? Why are they cast out, he and his zera, and are cast into ha'aretz which they know not?"
Yirmeyah,22,29,"O eretz, eretz, eretz, hear the Devar Hashem."
Yirmeyah,22,30,"Thus saith Hashem , Write ye this ish ariri (childless), a gever (man) who shall not prosper in his days; for none of his zera shall prosper, sitting upon the kisse Dovid, or moshel od (rule anymore) in Yehudah."
Yirmeyah,23,1,Woe be unto the ro'im that destroy and scatter the tzon of My pasture! saith Hashem.
Yirmeyah,23,2,"Therefore thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel against the ro'im that shepherd My people; Ye have scattered My tzon, and driven them away, and have not attended to them; hineni, I will attend to you for the rah of your doings, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,23,3,"And I will gather the she'erit (remnant) of My tzon out of all countries where I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase."
Yirmeyah,23,4,"And I will set up ro'im (shepherds) over them which shall shepherd them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,23,5,"Hinei, the days come, saith Hashem , that I will raise up unto Dovid a Tzemach Tzaddik, and a Melech shall reign and act wisely, and shall execute mishpat and tzedakah in ha'aretz."
Yirmeyah,23,6,"In his days Yehudah shall be saved, and Yisroel shall dwell safely; and this is Shmo whereby he shall be called Adonoi ( Hashem ) Tzidkeinu."
Yirmeyah,23,7,"Therefore, hinei, the days are coming, saith Hashem , that they shall no more say, Hashem liveth, which brought up the Bnei Yisroel out of Eretz Mitzrayim;"
Yirmeyah,23,8,"But, Hashem liveth, which brought up and which led the zera Bais Yisroel out of the eretz tzafonah, and from all countries to where I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land."
Yirmeyah,23,9,"Mine lev within me is broken because of the nevi'im; all my atzmot shake; I am like an ish shikkor, and like a gever (man) whom yayin hath overcome, because of Hashem , and because of Divrei Kadsho (His Holy Devarim)."
Yirmeyah,23,10,"For ha'aretz is full of mena'afim; for because of a curse ha'aretz mourneth; the pleasant places of the midbar are dried up, and their course is ra'ah, and their gevurah is not right."
Yirmeyah,23,11,"For both navi and kohen are profane; indeed, in My Beis have I found their wickedness, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,23,12,"Therefore their derech shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness; they shall be driven on, and fall therein; for I will bring ra'ah upon them, even the year of their visitation [for punishment], saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,23,13,"And I have seen a repulsive thing in the nevi'im of Shomron; they prophesied by Ba'al, and caused My people Yisroel to err."
Yirmeyah,23,14,"I have seen also in the nevi'im of Yerushalayim a horrible thing; they commit ni'uf and walk in sheker; they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth turn back from his wickedness; they are all of them unto Me as Sodom and the inhabitants thereof as Amora (Gomorrah)."
Yirmeyah,23,15,"Therefore thus saith Hashem Tzva'os concerning the nevi'im; Hineni, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the bitter water of gall; for from the nevi'im of Yerushalayim is chanupah (profaneness) gone forth into kol ha'aretz."
Yirmeyah,23,16,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, Pay no heed unto the devarim of the nevi'im that prophesy unto you; they are deluding you; they speak a chazon (vision) of their own lev, and not out of the mouth of Hashem."
Yirmeyah,23,17,"They say continually unto them that despise Me, Hashem hath said, Ye shall have shalom; and they say unto everyone that walketh after the sherirut (stubbornness) of his own lev, No ra'ah shall come upon you."
Yirmeyah,23,18,"For who hath stood in the sod (council) of Hashem , and hath perceived and heard His Devar? Who hath marked His word, and heard it?"
Yirmeyah,23,19,"Hinei, a whirlwind of Hashem is gone forth in fury, even a violent whirlwind; it shall fall grievously upon the rosh of the resha'im."
Yirmeyah,23,20,"The anger of Hashem shall not turn back, until He have executed, and until He have performed, the mezimmot (designs) of His lev; in the acharit hayamim ye shall understand it perfectly."
Yirmeyah,23,21,"I have not sent these nevi'im, yet they ran; I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied."
Yirmeyah,23,22,"But if they had stood in My sod (council) , and had caused My people to hear My Devarim, then they should have turned them from their derech harah, and from the ra'ah of their doings."
Yirmeyah,23,23,"Am I Elohei mikarov, saith Hashem , and not Elohei merachok?"
Yirmeyah,23,24,Can any ish hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith Hashem . Do not I fill Shomayim and Ha'Aretz? saith Hashem.
Yirmeyah,23,25,"I have heard what the nevi'im said, that prophesy sheker (lies) biShmi (in My Name) , saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed."
Yirmeyah,23,26,"How long shall this be in the lev of the nevi'im that prophesy sheker? Indeed, they are nevi'im of the delusion of their own lev;"
Yirmeyah,23,27,"Which think to cause My people to forget My Shem by their chalomot (dreams) which they tell every ish to his neighbor, as their avot have forgotten My Shem through Ba'al [worship]."
Yirmeyah,23,28,"The navi that hath a chalom, let him tell a chalom; and he that hath My Devar, let him speak My Devar emes (faithfully) . What is the chaff to the wheat? saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,23,29,Is not My Devar like an eish? saith Hashem . And like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?
Yirmeyah,23,30,"Therefore, hineni, I am against the nevi'im, saith Hashem , that steal My devarim every ish from his neighbor."
Yirmeyah,23,31,"Hineni, I am against the nevi'im, saith Hashem , that use their [own] lashon, and say, He saith."
Yirmeyah,23,32,"Hineni, I am against them that prophesy chalomot sheker, saith Hashem , and do tell them, and cause My people to err by their lies, and by their recklessness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,23,33,"And when this people, or the navi, or a kohen, shall ask thee, saying, What is the massa (burden, prophecy) of Hashem ? Thou shalt then say unto them, What massa (burden) ? I will even forsake you, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,23,34,"And as for the navi, and the kohen, and HaAm, that shall say, The massa (burden) of Hashem , I will even punish that ish and his bais."
Yirmeyah,23,35,"Thus shall ye say every ish to his neighbor, and every ish to his brother, What hath Hashem answered? And, What hath Hashem spoken?"
Yirmeyah,23,36,"And the massa (burden) of Hashem shall ye mention no more; for every man ºs word shall be his massa (burden) ; for ye have perverted the Devarim of the Elohim Chayyim, of Hashem Tzva'os Eloheinu."
Yirmeyah,23,37,"Thus shalt thou say to the navi, What hath Hashem answered thee? And, What hath Hashem spoken?"
Yirmeyah,23,38,"But since ye say, The massa (burden) of Hashem ; therefore thus saith Hashem , Because ye say this word, The massa (burden) of Hashem , and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The massa (burden) of Hashem;"
Yirmeyah,23,39,"Therefore, hineni, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the Ir that I gave you and avoteichem, and cast you out of My presence;"
Yirmeyah,23,40,"And I will bring a cherpat olam (everlasting disgrace) upon you, and a kelimut olam (perpetual dishonor) , which shall not be forgotten."
Yirmeyah,24,1," Hashem showed me, and, hinei, two baskets of figs were set in front of the Heikhal Hashem ; after that Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel had carried away into the Golus Melech Yehudah Yechanyah ben Y'hoyakim, and the sarim (princes) of Yehudah, with the craftsmen and artisans, from Yerushalayim, and had brought them to Babylon."
Yirmeyah,24,2,"One basket had figs tovot me'od, even like the figs that are early ripening; and the other basket had figs ra'ot me'od, which could not be eaten, they were so bad."
Yirmeyah,24,3,"Then said Hashem unto me, What seest thou, Yirmeyah? And I answered, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that cannot be eaten they are so bad."
Yirmeyah,24,4,"Again the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yirmeyah,24,5,"Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that of Yehudah are carried away unto the Golus, whom I have sent out of this place into the Eretz Kasdim (Chaldeans) for their good."
Yirmeyah,24,6,"For I will set mine eyes over them for tovah, and I will bring them again to ha'aretz hazot; and I will build them up, and not tear them down; and I will plant them, and not uproot them."
Yirmeyah,24,7,"And I will give them a lev to have da'as of me, that I am Hashem ; and they shall be My people, and I will be their Elohim; for they shall return unto Me with all their lev."
Yirmeyah,24,8,"And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad, surely thus saith Hashem , So will I give Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah, and his sarim (princes) , and the she'erit Yerushalayim, that remain in ha'aretz hazot, and them that dwell in Eretz Mitzrayim;"
Yirmeyah,24,9,"And I will deliver them for abhorrence, for an offense to kol mamlechot ha'aretz to be a reproach and a byword, a taunt and a kelalah (curse) in all places where I shall drive them."
Yirmeyah,24,10,"And I will send the cherev, the ra'av (famine) , and the dever (pestilence) , among them, until they are consumed from off ha'aretz that I gave unto them and to their avot."
Yirmeyah,25,1,"The davar that came to Yirmeyah concerning kol HaAm Yehudah in the fourth year of Y'hoyakim Ben Yoshiyah Melech Yehudah, that was the first year of Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel;"
Yirmeyah,25,2,"The which Yirmeyah HaNavi spoke unto kol HaAm Yehudah, and to all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, saying,"
Yirmeyah,25,3,"From the thirteenth year of Yoshiyah Ben Amon Melech Yehudah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the Devar Hashem hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not paid heed."
Yirmeyah,25,4,"And Hashem hath sent unto you all His avadim the nevi'im, rising early and sending them; but ye have not paid heed, nor inclined your ozen to hear."
Yirmeyah,25,5,"They said, Shuvu, make teshuvah now every ish from his derech ra'ah, and from the rah of your doings, and dwell in ha'aretz that Hashem hath given unto you and to avoteichem l'min olam v'ad olam;"
Yirmeyah,25,6,"And go not after elohim acherim to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke Me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no harm."
Yirmeyah,25,7,"Yet ye have not paid heed unto Me, saith Hashem ; that ye might provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt."
Yirmeyah,25,8,"Therefore thus saith Hashem Tzva'os; Because ye have not paid heed to My Devarim,"
Yirmeyah,25,9,"Hinei, I will send and take all the mishpekhot of the tzafon (north) , saith Hashem , and Avdi Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these Goyim all around, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations."
Yirmeyah,25,10,"Moreover I will cause to perish from them the kol sasson (voice of gladness) , and the kol simchah (voice of joy) , the voice of the Choson, and the voice of the Kallah, the sound of the millstones, and the ohr of the ner."
Yirmeyah,25,11,"And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these Goyim shall serve Melech Bavel shiv'im shanah (seventy years)."
Yirmeyah,25,12,"And it shall come to pass, when shiv'im shanah are accomplished, that I will punish Melech Bavel, and that nation, saith Hashem , for their avon, and the Eretz Kasdim (Land of Chaldeans) , and will make it perpetual desolations."
Yirmeyah,25,13,"And I will bring upon that land all My Devarim which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this sefer, which Yirmeyah hath prophesied against kol HaGoyim."
Yirmeyah,25,14,"For Goyim rabbim and melachim gedolim shall enslave them also; I will recompense them according to their deeds, according to the ma'aseh of their own hands."
Yirmeyah,25,15,"For thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel unto me, Take this kos hayayin haChemah (wine cup of wrath) from My yad, and cause kol HaGoyim, to whom I send thee, to drink it."
Yirmeyah,25,16,"And they shall drink, and stagger, and go mad, because of the cherev that I will send among them."
Yirmeyah,25,17,"Then took I the Kos from the yad Hashem , and made all the Goyim to drink, unto whom Hashem had sent me;"
Yirmeyah,25,18,"Namely, Yerushalayim, and the towns of Yehudah, and the melachim thereof, and the sarim thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a kelalah (curse) ; as it is this day;"
Yirmeyah,25,19,"Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, and his avadim, and his sarim and all his people;"
Yirmeyah,25,20,"And all the mixed multitude rabble, and kol melachim of Eretz Utz, and kol melachim of Eretz Pelishtim, and Ashkelon, and Azah (Gaza) , and Ekron, and the she'erit (remnant) of Ashdod,"
Yirmeyah,25,21,"Edom, and Moav, and the Bnei Ammon,"
Yirmeyah,25,22,"And kol melachim of Tzor, and kol melachim of Tzidon, and the melachim of the coastlands which are beyond the yam,"
Yirmeyah,25,23,"Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost [desert] fringes,"
Yirmeyah,25,24,"And kol melachim of Arabia, and kol melachim of the mixed multitude rabble that dwell in the desert,"
Yirmeyah,25,25,"And kol melachim of Zimri, and kol melachim of Eilam, and kol melachim of the Medes,"
Yirmeyah,25,26,"And kol melachim of the tzafon, far and near, one after another, and all the mamlechot ha'aretz, which are upon the face of adamah; and Melech Sheshach shall drink after them."
Yirmeyah,25,27,"Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel; Drink ye, and become shikkor, and vomit, and fall, and rise no more, because of the cherev which I will send among you."
Yirmeyah,25,28,"And it shall be, if they refuse to take the Kos at thine yad to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, Ye shall certainly drink."
Yirmeyah,25,29,"For, hinei, I begin to bring ra'ah on the Ir which is called by My Shem, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a cherev upon all the inhabitants of ha'aretz, saith Hashem Tzva'os."
Yirmeyah,25,30,"Therefore prophesy thou against them all these Devarim, and say unto them, Hashem shall roar from on high, and utter His voice from His Ma'on Kodesh; He shall mightily roar upon His Naveh (Dwelling) ; He shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of ha'aretz."
Yirmeyah,25,31,"A noise shall come even to the ends of ha'aretz; for Hashem hath a legal controversy with the Goyim, He will plead His case with kol basar; He will give them that are wicked to the cherev, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,25,32,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, Hinei, ra'ah shall go forth from Goy to Goy, and a sa'ar gadol (great whirlwind) shall be raised up from the farthest ends of Eretz."
Yirmeyah,25,33,"And the slain of Hashem shall be at that day from one end of ha'aretz even unto the other end of ha'aretz; they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the adamah."
Yirmeyah,25,34,"Wail, ye ro'im (shepherds) , and weep; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye leaders of the tzon; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a precious pottery vessel."
Yirmeyah,25,35,"And the ro'im (shepherds) shall have no refuge for fleeing, nor the leader of the tzon to escape."
Yirmeyah,25,36,"A voice of the cry of the ro'im and a wailing of the leaders of the tzon, shall be heard: for Hashem hath destroyed their pasture."
Yirmeyah,25,37,And the ne'ot hashalom (peaceful folds) are laid waste because of the Charon Af Hashem.
Yirmeyah,25,38,"He hath left His hiding place, as the lion; for their land is desolate because of the charon (anger) of the oppressor, and because of His charon af."
Yirmeyah,26,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Y'hoyakim (Jehoiakim) Ben Yoshiyah Melech Yehudah came this Davar from Hashem saying,"
Yirmeyah,26,2,"Thus saith Hashem : Stand in the khatzer (courtyard) of the Bais Hashem , and speak unto all the towns of Yehudah, which come to worship in the Bais Hashem , all the Devarim that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word;"
Yirmeyah,26,3,"If so be they will pay heed, turn every man from his derech hara'ah, that I may relent of the ra'ah, which I purpose to do unto them for the evil of their doings."
Yirmeyah,26,4,"And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Hashem : If ye will not pay heed to Me, to walk in My torah, which I have set before you,"
Yirmeyah,26,5,"To pay heed to the Devarim of My Avadim the Nevi'im, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early and sending them, but ye have not paid heed;"
Yirmeyah,26,6,"Then will I make this Bais like Shiloh, and will make this city a kelalah (curse) to all the Goyim of Ha'Aretz."
Yirmeyah,26,7,So the kohanim and the nevi'im and kol HaAm heard Yirmeyah speaking these Devarim in the Bais Hashem.
Yirmeyah,26,8,"Now it came to pass, when Yirmeyah had made an end of speaking all that Hashem had commanded him to speak unto kol HaAm, that the kohanim and the nevi'im and kol HaAm laid hold of him, saying, Thou shalt surely die."
Yirmeyah,26,9,"Why hast thou prophesied B'Shem Hashem , saying, This Bais shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And kol HaAm were gathered against Yirmeyah in the Bais Hashem."
Yirmeyah,26,10,"When the sarim of Yehudah heard these things, then they came up from the Bais HaMelech to the Beis Hashem , and sat down in the petach Sha'ar HeChadash (entrance of the New Gate) of [the Beis] Hashem."
Yirmeyah,26,11,"Then spoke the kohanim and the nevi'im unto the sarim and to kol HaAm, saying, Mishpat mavet for this ish! For he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your oznayim."
Yirmeyah,26,12,"Then spoke Yirmeyah unto all the sarim and to kol HaAm, saying, Hashem sent me to prophesy against this Bais and against this city all the Devarim that ye have heard."
Yirmeyah,26,13,"Therefore now reform your drakhim and your doings, and obey the voice of Hashem Eloheichem; and Hashem will relent of the ra'ah that He hath pronounced against you."
Yirmeyah,26,14,"As for me, see, I am in your yad; do with me as seemeth tov and yashar unto you."
Yirmeyah,26,15,"But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring dahm naki upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof; for b'emes Hashem hath sent me unto you to speak all these Devarim in your oznayim."
Yirmeyah,26,16,Then said the sarim and kol HaAm unto the kohanim and to the nevi'im; This ish is not mishpat mavet (worthy of death) ; for he hath spoken to us B'Shem Hashem Eloheinu.
Yirmeyah,26,17,"Then rose up anashim zekenim ha'aretz, and spoke to kol kehal HaAm, saying,"
Yirmeyah,26,18,"Michah the Morashti prophesied in the days of Chizkiyah Melech Yehudah, and spoke to kol Am Yehudah, saying, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: Tziyon shall be plowed like a sadeh, and Yerushalayim shall become rubble heaps, and the Har HaBais (Temple Mount) like the bare heights of a ya'ar (forest)."
Yirmeyah,26,19,"Did Chizkiyah Melech Yehudah and kol Yehudah put him to death? Did he not fear Hashem , and besought Hashem , and Hashem relented of the ra'ah which He had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure ra'ah gedolah against nafshoteinu."
Yirmeyah,26,20,"And there was also an ish that prophesied B'Shem Hashem , Uriyah Ben Shema'yahu of Kiryat-HaYe'arim, who prophesied against this city and against HaAretz Hazot according to all the devarim of Yirmeyah."
Yirmeyah,26,21,"And when Y'hoyakim (Jehoiakim) HaMelech, with all his gibborim, and all the sarim, heard his words, HaMelech sought to put him to death; but when Uriyah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Mitzrayim;"
Yirmeyah,26,22,"And Y'hoyakim HaMelech sent anashim into Mitzrayim, namely, Elnatan Ben Achbor, and certain anashim with him into Mitzrayim."
Yirmeyah,26,23,"And they brought Uriyah out of Mitzrayim, and brought him unto Y'hoyakim HaMelech; who slaughtered him with the cherev, and cast his nevelah (dead body) into the kevarim of the Bnei HaAm (common people)."
Yirmeyah,26,24,"Nevertheless the yad (hand, influence) of Achikam Ben Shaphan was with Yirmeyah, that they should not give him into the yad HaAm to put him to death."
Yirmeyah,27,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Y'hoyakim Ben Yoshiyah Melech Yehudah came this davar unto Yirmeyah from Hashem , saying,"
Yirmeyah,27,2,"Thus saith Hashem to me: Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy tzavar (neck),"
Yirmeyah,27,3,"And send them to Melech Edom, and to Melech Moav, and to Melech Bnei Ammon, and to Melech Tzor, and to Melech Tzidon, by the yad of the malachim which come to Yerushalayim unto Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah;"
Yirmeyah,27,4,"And command them to say unto their adonim, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Thus shall ye say unto your adonim;"
Yirmeyah,27,5,"I have made ha'aretz (the earth) , ha'adam and habehemah that are upon the face of the earth, by My great ko'ach and by My outstretched zero'a, and have given it unto whom it seemed yashar unto Me."
Yirmeyah,27,6,"And now have I given all these lands into the yad Nevukhadnetzar Melech Bavel, Avdi (My servant) ; and the beasts of the sadeh have I given him also to serve him."
Yirmeyah,27,7,"And all Goyim shall serve him, and bno, and ben bno, until the very time of his land come; and then many Goyim and great melachim shall make him serve [in bondage to] them."
Yirmeyah,27,8,"And it shall come to pass, that the goy (nation) and mamlachah (kingdom) which will not serve the same Nevukhadnetzar Melech Bavel, and that will not put their tzavar (neck) under the yoke of HaMelech Bavel, that nation will I punish, saith Hashem , with the cherev, and with the ra'av (famine) , and with the dever, until I have consumed them by his yad."
Yirmeyah,27,9,"Therefore do not pay heed to your nevi'im, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve Melech Bavel;"
Yirmeyah,27,10,"For they prophesy sheker unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish."
Yirmeyah,27,11,"But the Goyim that bring their tzavar (neck) under the yoke of the Melech Bavel, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own adamah, saith Hashem ; and they shall till it, and dwell therein."
Yirmeyah,27,12,"I spoke also to Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah according to all these Devarim, saying, Bring your tzavarot (necks) under the yoke of Melech Bavel, and serve Him and his people, and live."
Yirmeyah,27,13,"Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the cherev, by the ra'av (famine) , and by the dever, as Hashem hath spoken against the goy (nation) that will not serve Melech Bavel?"
Yirmeyah,27,14,"Therefore do not pay heed unto the devarim of the nevi'im that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve Melech Bavel; for they prophesy sheker unto you."
Yirmeyah,27,15,"For I have not sent them, saith Hashem , yet they prophesy sheker in My name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the nevi'im that prophesy unto you."
Yirmeyah,27,16,"Also I spoke to the kohanim and to all this people, saying, Thus saith Hashem : Do not pay heed to the devarim of your nevi'im that prophesy unto you, saying, Hinei, the K'lei Beis Hashem shall now shortly be brought back from Bavel; for they prophesy sheker unto you."
Yirmeyah,27,17,"Do not pay heed unto them; serve Melech Bavel, and live; why should this ir be laid waste?"
Yirmeyah,27,18,"But if they are nevi'im, and if the Devar Hashem be with them, let them now make intercession to Hashem Tzva'os, that the kelim (vessels) which are left in the Beis Hashem , and in the Bais HaMelech Yehudah, and at Yerushalayim, go not to Bavel."
Yirmeyah,27,19,"For thus saith Hashem Tzva'os concerning the Ammudim (Pillars) and concerning the Yam (Sea) , and concerning the Mekhonot (Stands) [supporting the lavers], and concerning the remainder of the kelim that remain in this ir."
Yirmeyah,27,20,"Which Nevukhadnetzar Melech Bavel took not, when he carried away captive Yechanyah Ben Y'hoyakim Melech Yehudah from Yerushalayim to Bavel, and all the nobles of Yehudah and Yerushalayim;"
Yirmeyah,27,21,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel, concerning the kelim (vessels) that remain in the Beis Hashem , and in the Bais HaMelech Yehudah and Yerushalayim;"
Yirmeyah,27,22,"They shall be carried to Bavel, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith Hashem ; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this makon."
Yirmeyah,28,1,"And it came to pass The same year, in the beginning of the reign of Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Chananyah ben Azzur HaNavi, who was from Giv'on, spoke unto me in the Beis Hashem , before the eyes of the kohanim and of kol haAm, saying,"
Yirmeyah,28,2,"Thus says Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel, saying, I have broken the ol (yoke) of Melech Bavel."
Yirmeyah,28,3,"Within two years will I bring back into makon hazeh all the vessels of the Beis Hashem , that Nevukhadnetzar Melech Bavel took away from makon hazeh, and carried them to Babylon;"
Yirmeyah,28,4,"And I will bring back to this place Yechanyah ben Y'hoyakim Melech Yehudah, with all of Yehudah of the Golus, that went into Babylon, saith Hashem ; for I will break the ol (yoke) of Melech Bavel."
Yirmeyah,28,5,"Then Yirmeyah HaNavi said unto Chananyah HaNavi before the eyes of the kohanim, and before the eyes of kol HaAm that stood in the Beis Hashem,"
Yirmeyah,28,6,"Even Yirmeyah HaNavi said, Omein; may Hashem do so; Hashem perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the Beis Hashem , and all that is carried away into the Golus, from Babylon into makom hazeh."
Yirmeyah,28,7,"Nevertheless shema now hadavar hazeh that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of kol haAm;"
Yirmeyah,28,8,"The nevi'im that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against mamlechot gedolot, of milchamah, of ra'ah, of dever."
Yirmeyah,28,9,"The navi which prophesieth of shalom, when the devar of the navi shall come to pass, then shall the navi be recognized, that Hashem hath truly sent him."
Yirmeyah,28,10,Then Chananyah HaNavi took the yoke from off the neck of Yirmeyah HaNavi and broke it.
Yirmeyah,28,11,"And Chananyah spoke before the eyes of kol haAm, saying, Thus saith Hashem ; Even so will I break the yoke of Nevukhadnetzar Melech Bavel from the neck of kol HaGoyim within the space of two years. And Yirmeyah HaNavi went on his way."
Yirmeyah,28,12,"Then the Devar Hashem came unto Yirmeyah, after Chananyah HaNavi had broken the yoke from off the neck of Yirmeyah HaNavi, saying,"
Yirmeyah,28,13,"Go and tell Chananyah, saying, Thus saith Hashem ; Thou hast broken the motot etz (yokes, bars of wood) ; but thou shalt make for them motot barzel (yokes of iron)."
Yirmeyah,28,14,"For thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: I have put an ol barzel (yoke of iron) upon the neck of kol HaGoyim, that they may serve Nevukhadnetzar Melech Bavel; and they shall serve him; and I have given him the wild animals also."
Yirmeyah,28,15,"Then said Yirmeyah HaNavi unto Chananyah HaNavi, Shema nah, Chananyah; Hashem hath not sent thee; but thou makest HaAm HaZeh to trust in sheker (a lie)."
Yirmeyah,28,16,"Therefore thus saith Hashem ; Hineni, I will remove thee from off the face of ha'adamah; this year thou shalt die, because thou hast preached sarah (rebellion, apostasy, revolt, disobedience) against Hashem."
Yirmeyah,28,17,So Chananyah HaNavi died the same year in the seventh month.
Yirmeyah,29,1,"Now these are the Devarim of the sefer that Yirmeyah HaNavi sent from Yerushalayim unto the surviving Zekenim of the Golus and to the Kohanim, and to the Nevi'im, and to kol HaAm whom Nevukhadnetzar had carried away captive from Yerushalayim to Bavel ‚Äî"
Yirmeyah,29,2,"This was after Yechanyah HaMelech, and the Gevirah (Queen Mother) , and the sarisim, the sarim of Yehudah and Yerushalayim, and the carpenters, and the artisans had departed from Yerushalayim;"
Yirmeyah,29,3,"The sefer was sent by the yad of El'asah Ben Shaphan, and Gemaryah Ben Chilkiyah, whom Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah sent unto Bavel to Nevukhadnetzar Melech Bavel ‚Äî and it said,"
Yirmeyah,29,4,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel, unto all that are carried away into the Golus, whom I have caused to be carried away from Yerushalayim unto Bavel;"
Yirmeyah,29,5,"Build ye batim (houses) , and dwell in them; and plant gannot (gardens) , and eat the p'ri (fruit) of them;"
Yirmeyah,29,6,"Take ye nashim, and father banim and banot; and take nashim for your banim, and give your banot to anashim, that they may bear banim and banot; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished."
Yirmeyah,29,7,"And seek the shalom of the city where I have caused you to be carried away into the Golus, and daven unto Hashem for it; for in the shalom thereof shall ye have shalom."
Yirmeyah,29,8,"For thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Let not your nevi'im and your kesamim that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither pay heed to your chalomot which ye cause to be dreamed."
Yirmeyah,29,9,"For they prophesy b'sheker (falsely) unto you in My Name; I have not sent them, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,29,10,"For thus saith Hashem , That after shiv'im shanah (seventy years) are accomplished at Bavel I will visit you, and perform My Davar Hatov toward you, in causing you to return to this makom."
Yirmeyah,29,11,"For I know the machshavot (thoughts, plans) that I think toward you, saith Hashem , machshavot shalom, and not of ra'ah, to give you an acharit (future) and a tikvah (hope)."
Yirmeyah,29,12,"Then shall ye call upon Me, and ye shall go and v'hitpalaltem (and you [plural] will pray) unto Me, and I will pay heed unto you."
Yirmeyah,29,13,"And ye shall seek Me, and find Me, when ye shall search for Me b'chol lvavchem (with all your heart)."
Yirmeyah,29,14,"And I will be found by you, saith Hashem ; and I will bring you back from captivity, and I will gather you from all the Goyim, and from all the mekomot (places) where I have driven you, saith Hashem ; and I will bring you back into the makom (place) from which I caused you to be carried away into the Golus."
Yirmeyah,29,15,"Because ye have said, Hashem hath raised up nevi'im for us in Bavel;"
Yirmeyah,29,16,"Know that thus saith Hashem of HaMelech that sitteth upon the Kisse Dovid, and of kol HaAm that dwelleth in this city, and of your achim that are not gone forth with you into the Golus;"
Yirmeyah,29,17,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os; Hineni, I will send upon them the cherev, the ra'av, and the dever, and will make them like rotten figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad."
Yirmeyah,29,18,"And I will pursue them with the cherev, with the ra'av, and with the dever, and will make them a horror to all the mamlechot ha'aretz, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a cherpah, among all the Goyim where I have driven them;"
Yirmeyah,29,19,"Because they have not paid heed to My devarim, saith Hashem , which I sent unto them by My Avadim the nevi'im, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,29,20,"Hear ye therefore the Devar Hashem , all ye of the Golus, whom I have sent from Yerushalayim to Bavel;"
Yirmeyah,29,21,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel, about Ach'av Ben Kolayah, and of Tzidkiyah Ben Ma'aseiyah, which prophesy sheker unto you in My Name; Hineni, I will deliver them into the yad Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel; and he shall slay them before your eynayim;"
Yirmeyah,29,22,"And of them shall be taken up a kelalah (curse) by all the Golus of Yehudah which are in Bavel, saying, Hashem make thee like Tzidkiyah and like Ach'av, whom Melech Bavel roasted in the eish;"
Yirmeyah,29,23,"Because they have done nevalah (a foul deed, outrage) in Yisroel, and have committed ni'uf with their neighbors º nashim, and have spoken davar sheker in My Name, which I have not commanded them; I know, and am Ed (Witness) , saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,29,24,"Thus shalt thou also speak to Shema'yahu the Nechelami, saying,"
Yirmeyah,29,25,"Thus speaketh Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel, saying, Because thou hast sent sefarim in thy shem unto kol HaAm that are in Yerushalayim, and to Tzephanyah Ben Ma'aseiyah the kohen, and to all the kohanim, saying,"
Yirmeyah,29,26," Hashem hath made thee kohen in the place of Yehoyada the kohen, that there should be pekidim (officers) in the Beis Hashem , over every ish that is meshuggah (mad, insane) , and maketh himself a navi, that thou shouldest put him in the stocks, and in the neck iron."
Yirmeyah,29,27,"Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Yirmeyah of Anatot, which maketh himself a navi to you?"
Yirmeyah,29,28,"For therefore he sent unto us in Bavel, saying, This captivity is long; build ye batim (houses) , and dwell in them; and plant gannot (gardens) , and eat the fruit of them."
Yirmeyah,29,29,And Tzephanyah the kohen read this sefer in the oznayim of Yirmeyah HaNavi.
Yirmeyah,29,30,"Then came the Devar Hashem unto Yirmeyah, saying,"
Yirmeyah,29,31,"Send to all them of the Golus, saying, Thus saith Hashem concerning Shema'yah the Nechelami; Because that Shemaiyah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in sheker;"
Yirmeyah,29,32,"Therefore thus saith Hashem : Hinei, I will punish Shema'yah the Nechelami, and his zera; he shall not have an ish to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the tov that I will do for My people, saith Hashem ; because he hath spoken sarah (rebellion) against Hashem."
Yirmeyah,30,1,"The Davar that came to Yirmeyah from Hashem , saying,"
Yirmeyah,30,2,"Thus speaketh Hashem Elohei Yisroel, saying, Write thee all the Devarim that I have spoken unto thee in a sefer."
Yirmeyah,30,3,"For, hinei, the days are coming, saith Hashem , that I will bring back from captivity My people Yisroel and Yehudah, saith Hashem ; and I will cause them to return to ha'aretz that I gave to their avot, and they shall possess it."
Yirmeyah,30,4,And these are the Devarim that Hashem spoke concerning Yisroel and concerning Yehudah.
Yirmeyah,30,5,"For thus saith Hashem : We have heard a cry of fear, of pachad (terror) , and not of shalom."
Yirmeyah,30,6,"Ask ye now, and see whether a zachar (male) doth travail with child? Why do I see every gever with his hands on his stomach, like a woman in labor, and all faces are turned deadly pale?"
Yirmeyah,30,7,"Alas! For gadol hayom, so that none is like it; it is even the Et (Time) of Tzarah l'Ya'akov (Jacob ºs Trouble) , but he shall be saved out of it."
Yirmeyah,30,8,"For it shall come to pass in that day, saith Hashem Tzva'os, that I will break his yoke from off thy tzavar (neck) , and will burst thy bonds, and zarim (foreigners) shall no more make a slave of him;"
Yirmeyah,30,9,"But they shall serve Hashem Eloheihem, and Dovid their Melech, whom I will raise up for them."
Yirmeyah,30,10,"Therefore, fear thou not, O Avdi Ya'akov, saith Hashem ; neither be dismayed, O Yisroel; for, hineni, I will save thee from afar, and thy zera from the eretz of their captivity; and Ya'akov shall return, and shall be at rest, and be secure, and none shall make him afraid."
Yirmeyah,30,11,"For I am with thee, saith Hashem , to save thee; though I make a full end of all Goyim where I have scattered thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in mishpat, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished."
Yirmeyah,30,12,"For thus saith Hashem , Thy bruise is incurable, and thy makkah (blow, wound) is grievous."
Yirmeyah,30,13,"There is none to uphold thy cause, no refu'ot for your wound, no healing for you."
Yirmeyah,30,14,"All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the makkat oyev, with the musar (chastisement) of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine avon; because thy sins were increased."
Yirmeyah,30,15,"Why dost thou cry out over thine affliction? Thy pain is incurable for the multitude of thine avon; because thy chattot were increased, I have done these things unto thee."
Yirmeyah,30,16,"Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that plunder thee shall become plunder, and all that prey upon thee will I give for prey."
Yirmeyah,30,17,"For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy makkot (wounds) , saith Hashem ; because they called thee a Nidachah (Outcast) , saying, This is Tziyon, whom no one careth for."
Yirmeyah,30,18,"Thus saith Hashem ; Hineni, I will bring back the captivity of Ya'akov ºs ohalim, and have compassion on his dwelling places; and the Ir shall be rebuilt upon her own ruins, and the armon (citadel) shall stand on its rightful site."
Yirmeyah,30,19,"And out of them shall proceed todah (thanksgiving) and the voice of them that rejoice; and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also honor them, and they shall not be disdained."
Yirmeyah,30,20,"Their banim also shall be as formerly, and their Edah (Congregation) shall be established before Me, and I will punish all that oppress them."
Yirmeyah,30,21,"And their Adir (Prince, Leader) shall be one of their own, and their Moshel (ruler) shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto Me; for who is this that devoted his lev to approach unto Me? saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,30,22,"And ye shall be My people, and I will be your Elohim."
Yirmeyah,30,23,"Hinei, the whirlwind of Hashem goeth forth with chemah (wrath, fury) , a sweeping whirlwind; it shall fall violently upon the rosh of the resha'im."
Yirmeyah,30,24,"The Charon Af Hashem shall not return, until He hath accomplished it, and until He have performed the mezimmot (intents, purposes) of His lev; in the acharit hayamim (latter days) ye shall understand this."
Yirmeyah,31,1,"At the same time, saith Hashem , I will be Elohim l'khol mishpekhot Yisroel, and they shall be My people."
Yirmeyah,31,2,"Thus saith Hashem , The Am seridei cherev (the People that survived the cherev) found chen (grace) in the midbar; even Yisroel, when Yisroel journeyed to find [a place of] rest."
Yirmeyah,31,3," Hashem hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yes, I have loved thee with an ahavat olam; therefore with chesed have I drawn thee."
Yirmeyah,31,4,"Again I will build thee up, and thou shalt be rebuilt, O Betulat Yisroel; thou shalt again adorn thyself with thy timbrels, and shalt go forth in the dance of merrymakers."
Yirmeyah,31,5,"Thou shalt yet plant keramim upon the hills of Shomron; the planters shall plant, and shall put the fruit to ordinary use."
Yirmeyah,31,6,"For there shall be a yom, that the notzrim (watchmen) upon har Ephrayim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Tziyon unto Hashem Eloheinu."
Yirmeyah,31,7,"For thus saith Hashem ; Sing with simcha for Ya'akov, and shout among the Rosh HaGoyim; publish ye, hallelu (praise ye) , and say, Hashem , save Thy people, the She'erit Yisroel (the Remnant of Israel)."
Yirmeyah,31,8,"Hineni, I will bring them from the eretz tzafon (land of the north) , and gather them from the ends of ha'aretz, and with them the ivver (blind) and the pise'ach (lame) , the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together; a Kahal Gadol shall return here."
Yirmeyah,31,9,"They shall come with weeping, and with techinnunim will I lead them back; I will cause them to walk by the nachalei mayim (streams of water) in a derech yashar (straight road) , wherein they shall not stumble; for I am an Av to Yisroel, and Ephrayim is My bechor."
Yirmeyah,31,10,"Hear the Devar Hashem , O ye Goyim, and preach it in the farthest shores, and say, He that scattered Yisroel will gather Yisroel, and He shall be shomer over Yisroel, like a Ro'eh over the Eder thereof."
Yirmeyah,31,11,"For Hashem hath redeemed Ya'akov, and made Geulah (Redemption) for Ya'akov out of the yad of him that was chazak more than Ya'akov."
Yirmeyah,31,12,"Therefore they shall come and loudly, joyously sing on the height of Tziyon, and shall stream to the Tuv Hashem (Bounty, Goodness of Hashem) , for dagan (grain) , and for tirosh (new wine) and for yitzhar (pure olive oil) and for the young of the tzon and of the herd; and their nefesh shall be like a well-watered gan (garden) ; and they shall not sorrow any more at all."
Yirmeyah,31,13,"Then shall the betulah rejoice in the machol (dance) , both bocherim (young men) and zekenim together; for I will turn their evel (mourning) into sasson (joy) , and will comfort them, and make them have simcha from their sorrow."
Yirmeyah,31,14,"And I will satisfy the nefesh of the Kohanim with deshen (fatness, abundance) and My people shall be sated with My Tuv (Bounty, Goodness) , saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,31,15,"Thus saith Hashem ; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rachel, weeping for her banim, refused to be comforted for her banim, because they were no more."
Yirmeyah,31,16,"Thus saith Hashem ; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears; for sachar (reward) there will be for thy labor, saith Hashem ; and they shall return from the eretz oyev (land of the enemy)."
Yirmeyah,31,17,"And there is tikveh (hope) in thine acharit (future, latter end) , saith Hashem , that thy banim shall return to their own border."
Yirmeyah,31,18,"I have surely heard Ephrayim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, like an unbroken egel; turn Thou me, and I shall be turned; for Thou art Hashem Elohai."
Yirmeyah,31,19,"Surely after I turned away, I made teshuva; and after I was instructed, I beat upon my yarech (thigh) ; I was ashamed, yes, even humiliated, because nasati cherpat neurai (I did bear, carry the reproach, disgrace of my youth)."
Yirmeyah,31,20,"Is Ephrayim My ben yakir (dear son) ? Is he a yeled in whom I delight? For when I spoke of him, I do earnestly remember him still; therefore My heart yearns for him; I will surely have rachamim (mercy) upon him, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,31,21,"Set thee up tziyyunim (roadmarks, road signs) , make thee tamurim (guideposts) ; set thine lev upon the highway, even the derech thou art now walking; turn back, O Betulat Yisroel, turn back to these thy towns."
Yirmeyah,31,22,"How long wilt thou dillydally, O Bat HaShovevah (backsliding daughter) ? For Hashem barah chadashah( Hashem hath created a new thing) on ha'aretz; A nekevah (woman, female), shall encircle [seek out] a gever (man, male)."
Yirmeyah,31,23,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Once again they shall use this saying in Eretz Yehudah and in the towns thereof, when I shall turn them back from their captivity; yevarechecha Adonoi neveh tzedek har hakodesh (may Hashem bless thee, O Righteous Abode, O Har HaKodesh)!"
Yirmeyah,31,24,"There shall dwell in Yehudah itself, in all the towns thereof together, ikkarim (farmers) ; they also that go forth with the eder."
Yirmeyah,31,25,"For I will refresh the nefesh of the weary, and I will replenish even the stress-laden nefesh."
Yirmeyah,31,26,"Upon this, I awoke, and beheld; and my sheynah (sleep) was sweet unto me."
Yirmeyah,31,27,"Hinei, the days are coming, saith Hashem , that I will sow again Bais Yisroel and Bais Yehudah with the zera adam (human seed), and also with the zera behemah (animal seed)."
Yirmeyah,31,28,"And it shall come to pass, that just as I watched over them, to uproot, and to tear down, and to overthrow, and to destroy, and to bring catastrophe; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,31,29,"In those days they shall say no more, The Avot have eaten the sour grape, and the shinayim (teeth) of the Banim are set on edge."
Yirmeyah,31,30,"But every one shall die for his own avon (iniquity) ; kol haAdam that eateth the sour grape, his shinayim shall be set on edge."
Yirmeyah,31,31,"Hinei, the days come, saith Hashem , that I will cut a Brit Chadasha with Bais Yisroel, and with Bais Yehudah;"
Yirmeyah,31,32,"Not according to the Brit that I cut with their Avot in the day that I took hold of their yad to take them out of Eretz Mitzrayim; which My Brit they broke, although I was Ba'al (Husband) to them, saith Hashem;"
Yirmeyah,31,33,"But this shall be the Brit that I will cut with Bais Yisroel; After those days, saith Hashem , I will set My Torah in them inwardly, and I will write ketuvim on their hearts; and I will be their Elohim, and they shall be My People."
Yirmeyah,31,34,"And they shall teach no more every ish his re'a (neighbor) , and every ish his brother, saying, Know Hashem ; for they shall all have da'as of Me, from the katon of them unto the gadol of them, saith Hashem ; for I will forgive their avon, and I will remember their chattat no more."
Yirmeyah,31,35,"Thus saith Hashem , which giveth the shemesh for an ohr by day, and the chukkot yarei'ach and chukkot kokhavim for an ohr by night, which stirreth up the sea when the waves thereof roar; Hashem Tzva'os is Shmo:"
Yirmeyah,31,36,"If those chukkim depart from before Me, saith Hashem , then the Zera Yisroel also shall cease from being a Goy (Nation) before Me forever."
Yirmeyah,31,37,"Thus saith Hashem ; If Shomayim above can be measured, and, below, the foundations of ha'aretz can be searched out, I will also cast off kol Zera Yisroel for all that they have done, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,31,38,"Hinei, the days are coming, saith Hashem , that the Ir shall be built unto Hashem from the Migdal Chanan'el unto the Sha'ar HaPinnah (Corner Gate)."
Yirmeyah,31,39,"And the measuring line shall yet go forth straight ahead to Garev Hill, and around to Goah."
Yirmeyah,31,40,"And the whole valley [of Hinnom] of the pegarim (corpses) , and of the deshen (ashes) , and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the Sha'ar HaSusim (Horse Gate) to the east, shall be kodesh unto Hashem ; it shall not be uprooted, nor destroyed any more l'olam."
Yirmeyah,32,1,"The Davar that came to Yirmeyah from Hashem in the tenth year of Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah, which was the eighteenth year of Nevukhadretzar."
Yirmeyah,32,2,"For then the army of Melech Bavel besieged Yerushalayim; and Yirmeyah HaNavi was imprisoned in the Khatzer (courtyard) of the Guard, which was in Bais Melech Yehudah."
Yirmeyah,32,3,"For Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah had imprisoned him, saying, Why dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith Hashem , Hineni, I will give this city into the yad Melech Bavel, and he shall capture it;"
Yirmeyah,32,4,"And Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah shall not escape out of the yad of the Kasdim (Chaldeans) , but shall surely be delivered into the yad Melech Bavel, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eynayim shall behold his eynayim;"
Yirmeyah,32,5,"And he shall lead Tzidkiyah to Bavel, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith Hashem ; though ye fight against the Kasdim (Chaldeans) , ye shall not succeed."
Yirmeyah,32,6,"And Yirmeyah said, The Devar Hashem came unto me, saying,"
Yirmeyah,32,7,"Hinei, Chanam'el Ben Shallum thine dod (uncle) shall come unto thee saying, Buy thee my sadeh that is in Anatot: for the mishpat haGeulah (right of Redemption) is thine to buy it."
Yirmeyah,32,8,"So Chanam'el ben dodi came to me in the Khatzer (court) of the Guard according to the Devar Hashem , and said unto me, Buy my sadeh, now, that is in Anatot, which is in Eretz Binyamin; for the mishpat hayerushah (right of possession) is thine, and the geulah (redemption) is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the Devar Hashem."
Yirmeyah,32,9,"And I bought the sadeh of Chanam'el ben dodi, that was in Anatot, and weighed him out the kesef, even seventeen shekels of kesef."
Yirmeyah,32,10,"And I signed the sefer (deed) , and sealed it, and took edim (witnesses) , and weighed him out the kesef on the scales."
Yirmeyah,32,11,"So I took the sefer hamikneh (deed of purchase) , both that which was sealed according to the mitzvah and chukkim, and that which was the unsealed copy:"
Yirmeyah,32,12,"And I gave the sefer hamikneh unto Baruch Ben Neriyah Ben Machseiyah, in the sight of Chanam'el my cousin, and in the presence of the edim that signed the sefer hamikneh, before all the Yehudim that sat in the khatzer (courtyard) of the prison."
Yirmeyah,32,13,"And I charged Baruch before their eyes, saying,"
Yirmeyah,32,14,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Take these sefarim, this sefer hamikneh, both which is sealed, and this sefer which is unsealed; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may last yamim rabbim."
Yirmeyah,32,15,For thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Batim (houses) and sadot (fields) and kramim (vineyards) shall be bought again in this land.
Yirmeyah,32,16,"Now when I had delivered the sefer hamikneh unto Baruch Ben Neriyah, I davened unto Hashem , saying,"
Yirmeyah,32,17,"Ah Adonoi Hashem ! Hinei, Thou hast made the Shomayim and the Eretz by Thy koach hagadol and Thy outstretched zero'a, and there is nothing too difficult for Thee;"
Yirmeyah,32,18,"Thou showest chesed unto alafim, and recompensest avon avot into the kheyk of their banim after them; HaEl HaGadol HaGibbor Hashem Tzva'os Shmo,"
Yirmeyah,32,19,"Gadol in etzah (counsel) , and mighty in deed; for Thine eynayim are open upon all the drakhim of Bnei Adam; to give everyone according to his drakhim, and according to the fruit of his doings;"
Yirmeyah,32,20,"Which hast set otot and mofetim in Eretz Mitzrayim, even unto this day, and in Yisroel, and among adam (mankind) ; and hast made Thee a Shem, as at this day;"
Yirmeyah,32,21,"And hast brought forth Thy people Yisroel out of Eretz Mitzrayim with otot, and with mofetim, and with a yad chazakah, and with an outstretched zero'a, and with great terror;"
Yirmeyah,32,22,"And hast given them this land, which Thou didst swear to their avot to give them, eretz zavat cholov udevash;"
Yirmeyah,32,23,"And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not Thy voice, neither walked in Thy torah; they have done nothing of all that Thou commandedst them to do; therefore Thou hast caused all this ra'ah to come upon them."
Yirmeyah,32,24,"Hinei, the siege ramps, they are come unto the Ir to take it; and the Ir is given into the yad of the Kasdim (Chaldeans) , that fight against it, because of the cherev, and of the ra'av, and of the dever; and what Thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, Thou seest it."
Yirmeyah,32,25,"And Thou hast said unto me, O Adonoi Hashem , Buy thee the sadeh for kesef, and take edim (witnesses) ; for the Ir is given into the yad of the Kasdim (Chaldeans)."
Yirmeyah,32,26,"Then came the Devar Hashem unto Yirmeyah, saying,"
Yirmeyah,32,27,"Hinei, I am Hashem Elohei Kol Basar; is there any thing too difficult for Me?"
Yirmeyah,32,28,"Therefore thus saith Hashem : Hineni, I will give this city into the yad of the Kasdim (Chaldeans) , and into the yad of Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel, and he shall capture it;"
Yirmeyah,32,29,"And the Kasdim (Chaldeans) , that fight against this city, shall come and set eish to this city, and burn it with the batim (houses) , upon whose gagot (roofs) they have offered ketoret unto Ba'al, and poured out nesakhim (drink offerings) unto elohim acherim, to provoke Me to anger."
Yirmeyah,32,30,"For the Bnei Yisroel and the Bnei Yehudah have only done rah (evil) before Me from their youth; for the Bnei Yisroel have only provoked Me to anger with the work of their hands, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,32,31,"For this city hath been to Me as a provocation of Mine anger and of My fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before My face,"
Yirmeyah,32,32,"Because of all the ra'ah of the Bnei Yisroel and of the Bnei Yehudah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger, they, their melachim, their sarim, their kohanim, and their nevi'im, and the Ish Yehudah, and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim."
Yirmeyah,32,33,"And they have turned unto Me the oref (back) , and not the panim; though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not paid heed to receive musar."
Yirmeyah,32,34,"But they set their shikkutzim (abominations) in the Beis, which is called by Shmi, to make it tameh (unclean)."
Yirmeyah,32,35,"And they built the high places of Ba'al, which are in the Gey Ben Hinnom, to cause their banim and their banot to pass through the eish unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into My lev, that they should do this toe'vah (abomination) to cause Yehudah to sin."
Yirmeyah,32,36,"And now therefore thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the yad Melech Bavel by the cherev, and by the ra'av and by the dever;"
Yirmeyah,32,37,"Hineni, I will gather them out of all countries, where I have driven them in Mine anger, and in My fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them back unto this makom, and I will cause them to dwell securely;"
Yirmeyah,32,38,"And they shall be My people, and I will be their Elohim;"
Yirmeyah,32,39,"And I will give them lev echad (one heart) , and derech echad (one way) , that they may fear Me kol hayamim, for the tov of them, and of their banim after them;"
Yirmeyah,32,40,"And I will make a Brit Olam with them, that I will not turn away from doing them good; but I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me."
Yirmeyah,32,41,"Indeed, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land b'emes with all My lev and with all My nefesh."
Yirmeyah,32,42,"For thus saith Hashem ; Just as I have brought all this ra'ah hagedolah upon this people, so will I bring upon them kol hatovah that I have promised them."
Yirmeyah,32,43,"And sadeh shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without adam or behemah; it is given into the yad of the Kasdim (Chaldeans)."
Yirmeyah,32,44,"Sadot (fields) will be bought for kesef, and the sefer (deed) will be signed and sealed and witnessed in Eretz Binyamin, and in the places around Yerushalayim, and in the towns of Yehudah, and the towns of the hill country, and in the towns of the Shephelah, and in the towns of the Negev; for I will cause their captivity to return, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,33,1,"Moreover the Devar Hashem came unto Yirmeyah the second time, while he was yet imprisoned in the Khatzer of the Guard, saying,"
Yirmeyah,33,2,"Thus saith Hashem the Oseh (Maker) thereof, Hashem the Yotzer who formed it to establish it: Hashem Shmo;"
Yirmeyah,33,3,"Call unto Me, and I will answer thee, and show thee gedolot (great things) and unsearchable things, which thou knowest not."
Yirmeyah,33,4,"For thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel, concerning the batim (houses) of this city, and concerning the batim (houses) of the melachim of Yehudah, which are torn down for defense against siege ramps and against the cherev;"
Yirmeyah,33,5,"They come to fight against the Kasdim (Chaldeans) , but it is to fill these places with the pegarim (dead bodies) of adam, whom I have slain in Mine anger and in My wrath, and all for whose wickedness I have hid My face from this city."
Yirmeyah,33,6,"Hineni, I will bring it health and marpeh (healing) , and I will heal them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of shalom and emes."
Yirmeyah,33,7,"And I will cause the captives of Yehudah and the captives of Yisroel to return, and will rebuild those places, as at the first."
Yirmeyah,33,8,"And I will cleanse them from all their avon (iniquity) , whereby they have sinned against Me; and I will pardon all their avonot, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have committed peysha'im against Me."
Yirmeyah,33,9,"And it shall be to Me a Shem Sasson, a Tehillah and a Teferet before kol HaGoyim of Ha'Aretz, which shall hear all the tovah that I do unto them; and they shall fear and tremble for all the tovah and for all the shalom that I procure unto it."
Yirmeyah,33,10,"Thus saith Hashem ; Again there shall be heard in this makom, which ye say shall be desolate without adam and without behemah, even in the towns of Yehudah, and in the streets of Yerushalayim, that are desolate, without adam, and without inhabitant, and without behemah,"
Yirmeyah,33,11,"The kol (sound, voice) of sasson, and the voice of simchah, the voice of the Choson, and the voice of the Kallah, the voice of them that shall say, Hodu Hashem Tzva'os; for Hashem is tov; for His chesed endureth l'olam; and of them that shall bring the todah (thank offerings, sacrifice of praise) into the Beis Hashem . For I will cause the captives of the land to return, as at the first, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,33,12,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os; Again in this makom, which is desolate without adam and without behemah, and in all the towns thereof, shall be a naveh (dwelling) of ro'im (shepherds) resting their tzon."
Yirmeyah,33,13,"In the towns of the hill country, in the towns of the Shephelah, and in the towns of the Negev, and in Eretz Binyamin, and in the places around Yerushalayim, and in the towns of Yehudah, shall the tzon pass again under the hands of him that counteth them, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,33,14,"Hinei, the days are coming, saith Hashem , that I will perform that davar hatov which I have promised unto Bais Yisroel and unto Bais Yehudah."
Yirmeyah,33,15,"In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Tzemach Tzedakah to sprout up unto Dovid; He shall execute mishpat and tzedakah in ha'aretz."
Yirmeyah,33,16,"In those days shall Yehudah be saved, and Yerushalayim shall dwell securely; and this is what she shall be called, Hashem Tzidkeinu."
Yirmeyah,33,17,For thus saith Hashem ; Dovid shall never lack an ish to sit upon Kisse Bais Yisroel;
Yirmeyah,33,18,"Neither shall the kohanim the Levi'im lack an ish before Me to offer olah, and to burn minchah, and to do zevakh continually."
Yirmeyah,33,19,"And the Devar Hashem came unto Yirmeyah, saying,"
Yirmeyah,33,20,"Thus saith Hashem : If ye can break My Brit HaYom, and My Brit HaLailah, that there should not be yomam v'lailah (day and night) in their appointed times;"
Yirmeyah,33,21,"Then may also My Brit (covenant) be broken with Dovid Avdi, that he should not have Ben to reign upon his kisse; and with the Levi'im the kohanim, My mesharetim (ministers, servants)."
Yirmeyah,33,22,"As the Tzeva HaShomayim cannot be numbered, neither the chol (sand) of the yam (sea) measured, so will I multiply the zera Dovid Avdi, and the Levi'im that minister unto Me."
Yirmeyah,33,23,"Moreover the Devar Hashem came to Yirmeyah, saying,"
Yirmeyah,33,24,"Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two mishpekhot which Hashem hath chosen, He hath even cast them off? Thus they have despised My people, that they should be no more a nation before them."
Yirmeyah,33,25,"Thus saith Hashem ; If My Brit be not with yomam valailah, and if I have not appointed the chukkot of Shomayim vaAretz;"
Yirmeyah,33,26,"Then will I cast away the zera Ya'akov and Dovid Avdi, so that I will not take any of his zera to be moshelim (rulers) over the zera Avraham, Yischak, and Ya'akov; for I will cause their captives to return, and have mercy on them."
Yirmeyah,34,1,"The Davar which came unto Yirmeyah from Hashem , when Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel, and all his army, and all the mamlechot eretz (kingdoms of the earth) of his dominion, and all the peoples fought against Yerushalayim, and against all the towns thereof, saying,"
Yirmeyah,34,2,"Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel; Go and speak to Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah, and tell him, Thus saith Hashem : Hineni, I will give this city into the yad Melech Bavel, and he shall burn it with eish,"
Yirmeyah,34,3,"And thou shalt not escape out of his yad, but shalt surely be captured, and delivered into his yad; and thine eynayim shall behold the eynayim of Melech Bavel, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Bavel."
Yirmeyah,34,4,"Yet hear the Devar Hashem , O Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah; Thus saith Hashem of thee, Thou shalt not die by the cherev;"
Yirmeyah,34,5,"But thou shalt die in shalom; and with the [royal funeral spice] burnings of thy avot, the former melachim which were before thee, so shall they burn for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Hoy Adon! For I have pronounced the davar, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,34,6,"Then Yirmeyah HaNavi spoke all these devarim unto Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah in Yerushalayim,"
Yirmeyah,34,7,"When the army of Melech Bavel fought against Yerushalayim, and against all the towns of Yehudah that were left, against Lakhish, and against Azekah; for these fortified cities remained of the cities of Yehudah."
Yirmeyah,34,8,"This is the Davar that came unto Yirmeyah from Hashem , after that Tzidkiyah HaMelech had cut a Brit with kol HaAm which were at Yerushalayim, to proclaim deror (liberty) unto them;"
Yirmeyah,34,9,"That every ish should set free his eved, and every ish his shifchah, being Ivri (Hebrew man) or Ivriyah (Hebrew woman) ; that none should hold another brother Yehudi in bondage."
Yirmeyah,34,10,"Now when all the sarim, and kol HaAm, which had entered into the brit (covenant) , heard that every one should set free his eved, and every one his shifchah, that none should keep them in bondage, then they obeyed, and let them go."
Yirmeyah,34,11,"But afterward they changed their minds, and caused avadim and the shfakhot, whom they had set free, to return, and brought them into subjection for avadim and for shfakhot."
Yirmeyah,34,12,"Therefore the Devar Hashem came to Yirmeyah from Hashem , saying,"
Yirmeyah,34,13,"Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel; I cut a Brit with avoteichem in the day that I brought them forth out of Eretz Mitzrayim, out of the bais avadim, saying,"
Yirmeyah,34,14,"At the end of sheva shanim let ye go free every ish his brother HaIvri, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee shesh shanim, thou shalt let him go chofshi (free) from thee; but avoteichem paid heed not unto Me, neither inclined their ozen."
Yirmeyah,34,15,"And recently ye turned, and did hayashar (the right) in My sight, in proclaiming deror (liberty) every ish to his neighbor; and ye cut a Brit (covenant) before Me in the Beis which is called by Shmi;"
Yirmeyah,34,16,"But ye turned around and profaned Shmi, and caused every ish his eved, and every ish his shifchah, whom he had set at liberty at their desire, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for avadim and for shfakhot."
Yirmeyah,34,17,"Therefore thus saith Hashem ; Ye have not paid heed unto Me, in proclaiming deror (freedom) , everyone to his brother, and every ish to his neighbor; hineni, I proclaim deror (freedom) for you, saith Hashem , to the cherev, to the dever, and to the ra'av; and I will make you to be a horror to all the mamlechot ha'aretz."
Yirmeyah,34,18,"And I will give the anashim that have transgressed My Brit, which have not performed the Devarim of the Brit (covenant) which they had cut before Me, when they cut the egel (calf) in two, and passed between the parts thereof,"
Yirmeyah,34,19,"The sarim of Yehudah, and the sarim of Yerushalayim, the sarisim, and the kohanim, and kol Am HaAretz, which passed between the parts of the egel (calf);"
Yirmeyah,34,20,"I will even give them into the yad of their oyevim, and into the yad of them that seek their nefesh: and their nevilah (dead body) shall be for food unto the oph HaShomayim, and to the behemat ha'aretz."
Yirmeyah,34,21,"And Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah and his sarim will I give into the yad of their oyevim, and into the yad of them that seek their nefesh, and into the yad of Melech Bavel ºs army, which hast withdrawn from you."
Yirmeyah,34,22,"Hineni, I will command, saith Hashem , and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and capture it, and burn it with eish; and I will make the towns of Yehudah a desolation without an inhabitant."
Yirmeyah,35,1,"The Davar which came unto Yirmeyah from Hashem in the days of Y'hoyakim Ben Yoshiyah Melech Yehudah, saying,"
Yirmeyah,35,2,"Go unto the Bais of the Rechavim, and speak unto them, and bring them into the Beis Hashem , into one of the leshakhot (side rooms) , and give them yayin to drink."
Yirmeyah,35,3,"Then I took Ya'azanyah Ben Yirmeyah Ben Chavatzinyah, and his brethren, and all his banim, and kol Bais Rechavim;"
Yirmeyah,35,4,"And I brought them into the Beis Hashem , into the lishkah (room) of the Bnei Chanan Ben Yigdalyahu, an Ish HaElohim, which was by the lishkah of the sarim, which was above the lishkah of Ma'aseiyah Ben Shallum, the Shomer HaSaf (Gatekeeper);"
Yirmeyah,35,5,"And I set before the Bnei Bais Rechavim bowls full of yayin, and kosot (cups) , and I said unto them, Drink ye yayin."
Yirmeyah,35,6,"But they said, We will drink no yayin; for Yehonadav Ben Rechav avinu commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no yayin, neither ye, nor your banim ad olam;"
Yirmeyah,35,7,"Neither shall ye build bais, nor sow zera, nor plant kerem (vineyard) , nor have any; but all your days ye shall dwell in ohalim; that ye may live yamim rabbim in the adamah where ye are sojourners."
Yirmeyah,35,8,"Thus have we obeyed the voice of Yehonadav Ben Rechav avinu in all that he hath charged us, to drink no yayin kol yameinu (all our days) , we, our nashim, our banim, nor our banot;"
Yirmeyah,35,9,"Nor to build batim for us to dwell in; neither have we kerem, nor sadeh, nor zera;"
Yirmeyah,35,10,"But we have dwelt in ohalim, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Yehonadav avinu commanded us."
Yirmeyah,35,11,"But it came to pass, when Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel invaded ha'aretz, that we said, Come, and let us go to Yerushalayim because of the army of the Kasdim (Chaldeans) , and because of the army of Aram (the Syrians) ; so we dwell in Yerushalayim."
Yirmeyah,35,12,"Then came the Devar Hashem unto Yirmeyah, saying,"
Yirmeyah,35,13,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Go and tell the Ish Yehudah and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, Will ye not learn musar to pay heed to My devarim? saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,35,14,"The devarim of Yehonadav Ben Rechav, that he commanded his banim not to drink yayin, has been carried out; for unto this day they drink none, but obey the mitzvat avihem; notwithstanding, I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye paid heed not unto Me."
Yirmeyah,35,15,"I have sent also unto you all My avadim the Nevi'im, rising up early and sending them, saying, Turn ye now every ish from his derech hara'ah, and amend your doings, and go not after elohim acherim to serve them, and ye shall dwell in ha'adamah which I have given to you and to avoteichem; but ye have not inclined your ozen (ear) , nor paid heed unto Me."
Yirmeyah,35,16,"Indeed the Bnei Yehonadav Ben Rechav have carried out the mitzvat avihem, which he commanded them; but this people hath not paid heed unto Me:"
Yirmeyah,35,17,"Therefore, thus saith Hashem Elohei Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Hineni, I will bring upon Yehudah and upon all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim all the ra'ah that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken unto them, but they have not paid heed; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered."
Yirmeyah,35,18,"And Yirmeyah said unto the Bais Rechavim, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel; Because ye have obeyed the mitzvat Yehonadav avichem, and have been shomer over all his mitzvot, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you,"
Yirmeyah,35,19,Therefore thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Yehonadav Ben Rechav shall not lack an ish to stand before Me kol hayamim.
Yirmeyah,36,1,"And it came to pass in the fourth year of Y'hoyakim Ben Yoshiyah Melech Yehudah, that this Davar came unto Yirmeyah from Hashem , saying,"
Yirmeyah,36,2,"Take thee megilat sefer (scroll book) , and write therein all the Devarim that I have spoken unto thee against Yisroel, and against Yehudah, and against kol HaGoyim, from the day I spoke unto thee, from the yamim of Yoshiyah, even unto this day."
Yirmeyah,36,3,"It may be that Bais Yehudah will hear all the ra'ah (disaster, evil) which I purpose to do unto them; that they may turn every ish from his derech hara'ah; that I may forgive their avon and their chattat."
Yirmeyah,36,4,"Then Yirmeyah called Baruch Ben Neriyah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Yirmeyah all the Divrei Hashem , which he spoke unto him, upon a megilat sefer."
Yirmeyah,36,5,"And Yirmeyah commanded Baruch, saying, I am atzur (restricted, barred) ; I cannot go into Bais Hashem;"
Yirmeyah,36,6,"Therefore go thou, and read from the megilah, which thou hast written from my mouth, the Divrei Hashem in the oznayim (ears) of HaAm in the Bais Hashem on the yom tzom; and also thou shalt read them in the oznayim of all Yehudah that will be coming from their towns."
Yirmeyah,36,7,"It may be they will present their techinnah (supplication) before Hashem , and they will turn every ish from his derech hara'ah; for gadol is the anger and the wrath that Hashem hath pronounced against HaAm Hazeh."
Yirmeyah,36,8,"And Baruch Ben Neriyah did according to all that Yirmeyah HaNavi commanded him, reading the Sefer Divrei Hashem in the Bais Hashem."
Yirmeyah,36,9,"And it came to pass in the fifth year of Y'hoyakim Ben Yoshiyah Melech Yehudah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a tzom before Hashem to kol HaAm in Yerushalayim, and to kol HaAm that came from the towns of Yehudah unto Yerushalayim."
Yirmeyah,36,10,"Then Baruch read from the Sefer the Divrei Yirmeyah in the Bais Hashem , in the lishkah (chamber) of Gemaryah Ben Shaphan the sofer, in the khatzer haelyon, at the Petach Sha'ar HeChadash of Bais Hashem , in oznayim kol HaAm."
Yirmeyah,36,11,"When Michayah Ben Gemaryah, Ben Shaphan, had heard kol Divrei Hashem out of the Sefer,"
Yirmeyah,36,12,"Then he went down into the Bais HaMelech, into the lishkah of the sofer, and, hinei, all the sarim sat there, even Elishama the sofer, and Delayahu Ben Shema'yahu, and Elnatan Ben Achbor, and Gemaryah Ben Shaphan, and Tzidkiyah Ben Chananyahu, and the sarim (officials)."
Yirmeyah,36,13,"Then Michayah declared unto them all the Devarim that he had heard, when Baruch read the Sefer in the oznayim of HaAm."
Yirmeyah,36,14,"Therefore all the sarim sent Yehudi Ben Netanyahu Ben Shelemyah Ben Cushi unto Baruch, saying, Bring in thine yad the megilah wherein thou hast read in the oznayim of HaAm, and come. So Baruch Ben Neriyah took the megilah in his yad, and came unto them."
Yirmeyah,36,15,"And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in ozneinu (our ears) . So Baruch read it in their oznayim."
Yirmeyah,36,16,"Now it came to pass, when they had heard kol haDevarim, they were afraid [looking fearfully] one to the other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell HaMelech of all these Devarim."
Yirmeyah,36,17,"And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these Devarim at his peh (mouth)?"
Yirmeyah,36,18,"Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these Devarim unto me with his peh (mouth, dictation) and I wrote them with dyo (ink) in the Sefer."
Yirmeyah,36,19,"Then said the sarim unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Yirmeyah; and let no ish have da'as of where ye be."
Yirmeyah,36,20,"And they went into the khatzer HaMelech, but they laid up the megilah in the lishka of Elishama the Sofer, and told all the Devarim in the oznayim of HaMelech."
Yirmeyah,36,21,"So HaMelech sent Yehudi to bring the megilah; and he brought it out the lishka of Elishama the sofer. And Yehudi read it in the oznayim of HaMelech, and in the oznayim of all the sarim which Tzidkiyah Ben Chananyahu, and all stood beside HaMelech."
Yirmeyah,36,22,Now HaMelech sat in the Bais Hakhoref (Winter House) in the ninth month; and there was an akh (fireplace) burning before him.
Yirmeyah,36,23,"And it came to pass, that when Yehudi had read three or four delatot (columns) , he cut it with a ta'ar hasofer (razor of a scribe) , and cast it into the eish that was in the akh (fireplace) , until all the megilah was consumed in the eish that was in the akh (fireplace)."
Yirmeyah,36,24,"Yet they were not afraid, nor tore their begadim, neither HaMelech, nor any of his avadim that heard all these Devarim."
Yirmeyah,36,25,Nevertheless Elnatan and Delayahu and Gemaryah had made intercession to HaMelech that he would not burn the megilah; but he would not heed them.
Yirmeyah,36,26,"HaMelech ordered that Yerachme'el Ben Hammelech, Serayah Ben Azriel, and Shelemyah Ben Avde'el, arrest Baruch HaSofer and Yirmeyah HaNavi; but Hashem hid them."
Yirmeyah,36,27,"Then the Devar Hashem came to Yirmeyah, after that HaMelech had burned the megilah, and the Devarim which Baruch wrote at the peh of Yirmeyah, saying,"
Yirmeyah,36,28,"Shuv (turn) and take thee again another megilah, and write on it all the Devarim HaRishonim (former words) that were in the Megilah HaRishonah, which Y'hoyakim Melech Yehudah hath burned."
Yirmeyah,36,29,"And thou shalt say to Y'hoyakim Melech Yehudah, Thus saith Hashem : Thou hast burned this megilah, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, Melech Bavel shall certainly come and destroy HaAretz Hazot, and shall cause to cease from it adam and behemah?"
Yirmeyah,36,30,"Therefore thus saith Hashem of Y'hoyakim Melech Yehudah: He shall have none to sit upon the kisse Dovid; and his nevelah (dead body) shall be cast out in the chorev (heat, drought) of the yom, and in the kerakh (ice, frost) of the lailah."
Yirmeyah,36,31,"And I will visit him [for punishment] and his zera and his avadim for their avon; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, and upon the Ish Yehudah, all the ra'ah (disaster, evil) that I have pronounced against them; yet they did not pay heed."
Yirmeyah,36,32,"Then took Yirmeyah another megilah, and gave it to Baruch Ben Neriyah, HaSofer, who wrote therein from the peh of Yirmeyah all the Divrei HaSefer which Y'hoyakim Melech Yehudah had burned in eish; and there were added besides unto them many similar Devarim."
Yirmeyah,37,1,"And Melech Tzidkiyah Ben Yoshiyah reigned instead of Konyahu Ben Y'hoyakim, whom Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel put on the throne in Eretz Yehudah."
Yirmeyah,37,2,"But neither he, nor his avadim, nor the Am HaAretz, did pay heed unto the Divrei Hashem , which He spoke by Yirmeyah HaNavi."
Yirmeyah,37,3,"And HaMelech Tzidkiyah sent Yehukhal Ben Shelemyah and Tzephanyah Ben Ma'aseiyah the Kohen to Yirmeyah HaNavi, saying, Hitpalel na (pray now) unto Hashem Eloheinu for us."
Yirmeyah,37,4,Now Yirmeyah came in and went out among HaAm; for they had not put him into bais hakeleh (prison).
Yirmeyah,37,5,"Then the army of Pharaoh was come forth out of Mitzrayim; and when the Kasdim (Chaldeans) that besieged Yerushalayim heard news of them, they withdrew from Yerushalayim."
Yirmeyah,37,6,"Then came the Devar Hashem unto Yirmeyah HaNavi saying,"
Yirmeyah,37,7,"Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel; Thus shall ye say to Melech Yehudah, that sent you unto Me to enquire of Me; Hinei, the army of Pharaoh, which is come forth l'ezrah (to help, support) you, shall return to Mitzrayim into their own land."
Yirmeyah,37,8,"And the Kasdim (Chaldeans) shall return, and fight against HaIr hazot (this City), and capture it, and burn it down with eish."
Yirmeyah,37,9,"Thus saith Hashem ; Deceive not nafshoteichem, saying, The Kasdim (Chaldeans) shall surely depart from us; for they shall not depart."
Yirmeyah,37,10,"For though ye had struck down kol chayil Kasdim (the whole army of the Chaldeans) that fight against you, and there remained but anashim medukarim (wounded men) among them, yet should they rise up every ish in his ohel, and with eish burn down HaIr hazot."
Yirmeyah,37,11,"And it came to pass, that when the army of the Kasdim (Chaldeans) was withdrawn from Yerushalayim because of the army of Pharaoh,"
Yirmeyah,37,12,"Then Yirmeyah went forth out of Yerushalayim to go into the Eretz Binyamin, to get [his] chelek from there among HaAm."
Yirmeyah,37,13,"And when he was in the Sha'ar Binyamin, a ba'al pekidut (captain of the guard) was there, shmo Yiriyah Ben Shelemyah Ben Chananyah; and he arrested Yirmeyah HaNavi, saying, Thou fallest away as a deserter to the Kasdim (Chaldeans)."
Yirmeyah,37,14,"Then said Yirmeyah, Sheker; I fall not away as a deserter to the Kasdim (Chaldeans) . But he paid heed not to him; so Yiriyah arrested Yirmeyah, and brought him to the sarim."
Yirmeyah,37,15,"Therefore the sarim were enraged with Yirmeyah, and had him beaten, and put him in house arrest in the Bais Yehonatan the Sofer; for they had made that the bais hakeleh (prison)."
Yirmeyah,37,16,"When Yirmeyah was entered into the bais habor (dungeon) , and into the cells, and Yirmeyah had remained there yamim rabbim;"
Yirmeyah,37,17,"Then HaMelech Tzidkiyah sent, and brought him out; and HaMelech asked him baseter (secretly) in his Bais (Palace) , and said, Is there Devar from Hashem ? And Yirmeyah said, There is; for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the yad Melech Bavel."
Yirmeyah,37,18,"Moreover Yirmeyah said unto HaMelech Tzidkiyah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy avadim, or against Am Hazeh, that ye have put me in bais hakeleh?"
Yirmeyah,37,19,"Where are now your nevi'im which prophesied unto you, saying, Melech Bavel shall not come against you, nor against HaAretz hazot?"
Yirmeyah,37,20,"Therefore hear now, O adoni HaMelech; let now my techinnah be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the Bais Yehonatan HaSofer, lest I die there."
Yirmeyah,37,21,"Then HaMelech Tzidkiyah commanded that they should commit Yirmeyah into the Khatzer (courtyard) of the Guard, and that they should give him daily kikar lechem (loaf of bread) out of the street of ha'ofim (the bakers) , until all the lechem in the Ir was gone. Thus Yirmeyah remained in the Khatzer (courtyard) of the Guard."
Yirmeyah,38,1,"Then Shephatyah Ben Mattan, and Gedalyahu Ben Pashchur, and Yukhal Ben Shelemyah, and Pashchur Ben Malkiyah, heard the Devarim that Yirmeyah had spoken unto kol HaAm, saying,"
Yirmeyah,38,2,"Thus saith Hashem , He that remaineth in this city shall die by the cherev, by the ra'av, and by the dever; but he that goeth forth to the Kasdim (Chaldeans) shall live; for he shall have his nefesh for plunder, and shall live."
Yirmeyah,38,3,"Thus saith Hashem , This city shall surely be given into the yad of the army of Melech Bavel, which shall capture it."
Yirmeyah,38,4,"Therefore the sarim said unto HaMelech, Let now this ish be put to death; for thus he weakeneth the hands of the anshei hamilchamah that are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such devarim unto them; for this ish seeketh not the shalom of this people, but the hurt."
Yirmeyah,38,5,"Then Tzidkiyah HaMelech said, Hinei, he is in your yad (hand, power) ; for HaMelech is not he that can do anything against you."
Yirmeyah,38,6,"Then took they Yirmeyah, and cast him into the bor (pit, dungeon, cistern) of Malkiyah Ben Hammelech, that was in the Khatzer (courtyard) of the Guard; and they lowered Yirmeyah with ropes. And in the bor (pit) there was no mayim, but mud; so Yirmeyah sank in the mud."
Yirmeyah,38,7,"Now when Eved-melech HaCushi (the Ethiopian) , an ish saris (official) in the Bais HaMelech, heard that they had put Yirmeyah in the bor; HaMelech was then sitting in the Sha'ar Binyamin;"
Yirmeyah,38,8,"Eved-melech went forth out of the Bais HaMelech, and spoke to HaMelech saying,"
Yirmeyah,38,9,"Adoni HaMelech, these anashim have done ra'ah in all that they have done to Yirmeyah HaNavi, whom they have cast into the bor; and he is likely to die from hunger in the place where he is; for there is no more lechem in the Ir."
Yirmeyah,38,10,"Then HaMelech commanded Eved-melech HaCushi (the Ethiopian) , saying, Take from here shloshim anashim with thee, and lift up Yirmeyah HaNavi out of the bor (dungeon) , before he dies."
Yirmeyah,38,11,"So Eved-melech took the anashim with him, and went into the Bais HaMelech under the Otzar (Treasury) , and took from there old rags and old worn out clothes, and let them down by ropes into the bor to Yirmeyah."
Yirmeyah,38,12,"And Eved-melech HaCushi said unto Yirmeyah, Put now these old rags and worn out clothes under thine armpits under the ropes. And Yirmeyah did so."
Yirmeyah,38,13,"So they drew up Yirmeyah with ropes, and lifted him up out of the bor; and Yirmeyah remained in the Khatzer (courtyard) of the Guard."
Yirmeyah,38,14,"Then Tzidkiyah HaMelech sent, and took Yirmeyah HaNavi unto him into the third entrance that is in the Bais Hashem ; and HaMelech said unto Yirmeyah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me."
Yirmeyah,38,15,"Then Yirmeyah said unto Tzidkiyah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? And if I give thee etzah, wilt thou not refuse to pay heed unto me?"
Yirmeyah,38,16,"So Tzidkiyah HaMelech swore secretly unto Yirmeyah, saying, As Hashem liveth, that made our very nefesh, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the yad of these anashim that seek thy nefesh."
Yirmeyah,38,17,"Then said Yirmeyah unto Tzidkiyah, Thus saith Hashem Elohei Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: If thou wilt assuredly surrender unto the sarim of Melech Bavel, then thy nefesh shall live, and this city shall not be burned down with eish; and thou shalt live, and thine Bais;"
Yirmeyah,38,18,"But if thou wilt not surrender unto the sarim of Melech Bavel, then shall this city be given into the yad of the Kasdim, and they shall burn it down with eish, and thou shalt not escape out of their yad."
Yirmeyah,38,19,"And Tzidkiyah HaMelech said unto Yirmeyah, I am afraid of the Yehudim that are fallen as defectors to the Kasdim (Chaldeans) , lest they deliver me into their yad, and they abuse me."
Yirmeyah,38,20,"But Yirmeyah said, They shall not deliver thee. Now obey the voice of Hashem , which I speak unto thee; so it shall be well unto thee, and thy nefesh shall live."
Yirmeyah,38,21,"But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the davar that Hashem hath showed me:"
Yirmeyah,38,22,"And, hinei, all the nashim that are left in the Bais Melech Yehudah shall be brought forth to the sarim of Melech Bavel, and those nashim shall say, Thy close friends misled thee, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mud, and they desert thee."
Yirmeyah,38,23,"So they shall surrender all thy nashim and thy banim to the Kasdim (Chaldeans) ; and thou shalt not escape out of their yad, but shalt be captured by the yad Melech Bavel; and thou shalt cause this city to be burned down with eish."
Yirmeyah,38,24,"Then said Tzidkiyah unto Yirmeyah, Let no ish know of these devarim, and thou shalt not die."
Yirmeyah,38,25,"But if the sarim hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto HaMelech, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what HaMelech said unto thee;"
Yirmeyah,38,26,"Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my techinnah (supplication) before HaMelech, that he would not cause me to return to Bais Yehonatan, to die there."
Yirmeyah,38,27,"Then came all the sarim unto Yirmeyah, and questioned him; and he told them according to all these devarim that HaMelech had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter had not been overheard."
Yirmeyah,38,28,So Yirmeyah abode in the Khatzer (courtyard) of the Guard until the day that Yerushalayim was captured; and he was there when Yerushalayim was taken.
Yirmeyah,39,1,"In the ninth year of Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah, in the tenth month, came Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel and all his army against Yerushalayim, and they besieged her."
Yirmeyah,39,2,"And in the eleventh year of Tzidkiyah, in the fourth month, the ninth yom of the month, the wall was broken through."
Yirmeyah,39,3,"And all the sarim (princes) of Melech Bavel came in, and sat in the Middle Gate, even Nergal Sar-Etzer, Samgar-Nevo, Sar-Sechim, Rav Saris, Nergal Sar-Etzer, Rav-Mag, with all the remaining of the sarim of Melech Bavel."
Yirmeyah,39,4,"And it came to pass, that when Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah saw them, and all the anshei hamilchamah, then they fled, and went forth out of the Ir by lailah, by the derech of the Gan HaMelech, by the sha'ar between the two walls; and he headed toward the Aravah."
Yirmeyah,39,5,"But the army of the Kasdim pursued after them, and overtook Tzidkiyah in the plains of Yericho; and when they had captured him, they brought him up to Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel to Rivlah in Eretz Chamat, where he pronounced mishpatim upon him."
Yirmeyah,39,6,Then Melech Bavel slaughtered the Bnei Tzidkiyah in Rivlah before his eyes; also Melech Bavel slaughtered all the nobles of Yehudah.
Yirmeyah,39,7,"Moreover he put out Tzidkiyah ºs eyes, and bound him with bronze chains, to carry him to Babylon."
Yirmeyah,39,8,"And the Kasdim burned the Bais HaMelech, and the bais haAm, with eish, and broke down the chomot Yerushalayim."
Yirmeyah,39,9,"Then Nevuzaradan the captain of the imperial guard carried away into the Golus of Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that defected, that went over to him, with the rest of the people that remained."
Yirmeyah,39,10,"But Nevuzaradan the captain of the imperial guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in Eretz Yehudah, and gave them kramim (vineyards) and fields at the same time."
Yirmeyah,39,11,"Now Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel gave charge concerning Yirmeyah to Nevuzaradan the captain of the imperial guard, saying,"
Yirmeyah,39,12,"Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee."
Yirmeyah,39,13,"So Nevuzaradan the captain of the imperial guard sent, and Nevushazban, Rav-Saris, and Nergal Sar-Etzer, Rav-Mag, and all the officers of Melech Bavel;"
Yirmeyah,39,14,"Even they sent, and took Yirmeyah out of the Khatzer (courtyard) of the Guard, and committed him unto Gedalyahu ben Achikam ben Shaphan, that he should carry him home; so he remained and dwelt among the people."
Yirmeyah,39,15,"Now the Devar Hashem came unto Yirmeyah, while he was confined in the Khatzer (court) of the Guard, saying,"
Yirmeyah,39,16,"Go and tell Eved-Melech the Ethiopian (the one from Cush) , saying, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Hineni, I am bringing My words upon this city for ra'ah, and not for tovah; and they shall be accomplished in yom hahu before thee."
Yirmeyah,39,17,"But I will deliver thee in yom hahu, saith Hashem ; and thou shalt not be given into the yad of the anashim of whom thou art afraid."
Yirmeyah,39,18,"For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the cherev, but thy nefesh shall be unto thee for plunder; because thou hast put thy trust in Me, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,40,1,"The Davar that came to Yirmeyah from Hashem , after Nevuzaradan the captain of the imperial guard had released him from Ramah, when he had found him bound in chains among all of Yerushalayim and Yehudah of the Golus, which were being carried away captive unto Babylon."
Yirmeyah,40,2,"And the captain of the imperial guard took Yirmeyah, and said unto him, Hashem Eloheicha hath pronounced this ra'ah upon this place."
Yirmeyah,40,3,"Now Hashem hath brought it about, and done according as He hath said; because ye have sinned against Hashem , have not obeyed His voice, so Davar Hazeh is come upon you."
Yirmeyah,40,4,"And now, hinei, I loose thee this yom from the chains which were upon thine yad. If it seem good in thy eyes to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee; but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear; hinei, kol ha'aretz is before thee: where it seemeth tov and yashar there for thee to go, go there."
Yirmeyah,40,5,"Now if you remain, he said, Go back also to Gedalyah ben Achikam ben Shaphan, whom Melech Bavel hath made governor over the cities of Yehudah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wheresoever it seemeth yashar unto thee to go. So the captain of the imperial guard gave him provision [of food] and a present, and let him go."
Yirmeyah,40,6,Then went Yirmeyah unto Gedalyah ben Achikam to Mitzpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in ha'aretz.
Yirmeyah,40,7,"Now when all the officers of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their anashim, heard that Melech Bavel had made Gedalyahu ben Achikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him anashim, and nashim, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to the Golus of Babylon;"
Yirmeyah,40,8,"Then they came to Gedalyah to Mitzpah, even Yishmael ben Netanyah, and Yochanan and Yonatan the Bnei Kareach, and Serayah ben Tanchumet, and the Bnei Ephai the Netophati, and Yezanyah ben HaMa'akhati, they and their anashim."
Yirmeyah,40,9,"And Gedalyahu ben Achikam ben Shaphan swore an oath unto them and to their anashim, saying, Fear not to serve the Kasdim (Chaldeans) ; dwell in the land, and serve Melech Bavel, and it shall be well with you."
Yirmeyah,40,10,"As for me, hineni, I will dwell at Mitzpah, to serve the Kasdim (Chaldeans) , which will come unto us; but ye, gather ye yayin, and kayitz (summer fruit) , and shemen, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your towns that ye took over."
Yirmeyah,40,11,"Likewise when kol HaYehudim that were in Moav, and among the Bnei Ammon, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that Melech Bavel had left a she'erit (remnant) of Yehudah, and that he had set over them Gedalyahu ben Achikam ben Shaphan,"
Yirmeyah,40,12,"Then kol HaYehudim returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to Eretz Yehudah, to Gedalyahu, unto Mitzpah, and gathered yayin and kayitz very much."
Yirmeyah,40,13,"Moreover Yochanan ben Kareach, and all the officers of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedalyahu to Mitzpah,"
Yirmeyah,40,14,"And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Ba'alis Melech Bnei Ammon hath sent Yishmael ben Netanyah to slay thee? But Gedalyahu ben Achikam believed them not."
Yirmeyah,40,15,"Then Yochanan ben Kareach spoke to Gedalyahu in Mitzpah baseter (secretly) saying, Let me go, and I will slay Yishmael ben Netanyah, and no man shall know it. Why should he slay thee, that all the Yehudim which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the she'erit in Yehudah perish?"
Yirmeyah,40,16,"But Gedalyahu ben Achikam said unto Yochanan ben Kareach, Thou shalt not do this thing; for thou speakest sheker of Yishmael."
Yirmeyah,41,1,"Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Yishmael ben Netanyah ben Elishama, who was zera hameluchah, and the officers of HaMelech, even ten anashim with him, came unto Gedalyahu ben Achikam to Mitzpah; and there they did eat lechem together in Mitzpah."
Yirmeyah,41,2,"Then arose Yishmael ben Netanyah, and the ten anashim that were with him, and struck down Gedalyahu ben Achikam ben Shaphan with the cherev, and killed him, whom Melech Bavel had made governor over ha'aretz."
Yirmeyah,41,3,"Yishmael also killed kol haYehudim that were with him, even with Gedalyahu, at Mitzpah, and the Kasdim (Chaldeans) that were found there, and the anshei hamilchamah (men of war)."
Yirmeyah,41,4,"It came to pass on the second day after he had slain Gedalyahu and no man knew it,"
Yirmeyah,41,5,"That there came certain men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Shomron, even 80 men, their beards shaven, their clothes torn, having cut themselves, with minchah and incense in their hand, to bring them to the Beis Hashem."
Yirmeyah,41,6,"And Yishmael ben Netanyah went forth from Mitzpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went; and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedalyahu ben Achikam."
Yirmeyah,41,7,"And it was so, when they came into the midst of the Ir, that Yishmael ben Netanyah slaughtered them, and cast them into the midst of the cistern, he, and the anashim that were with him."
Yirmeyah,41,8,"But ten anashim were found among them that said unto Yishmael, Slay us not, for we have hidden in the sadeh, chittim, se'orim, shemen, devash. So he forbore, killed them not among the others."
Yirmeyah,41,9,"Now the cistern wherein Yishmael had cast all the pigrei ha'anashim (dead bodies of the men) , whom he had slain because of Gedalyahu, was the same cistern which Asa HaMelech had made for defense against Ba'asha Melech Yisroel: and Yishmael ben Netanyah filled it with them that were slain."
Yirmeyah,41,10,"Then Yishmael carried away captive all the she'erit of the people that were in Mitzpah, even the banot hamelech, and kol HaAm that remained in Mitzpah, whom Nevuzaradan the captain of the imperial guard had committed to Gedalyahu ben Achikam; and Yishmael ben Netanyah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Bnei Ammon."
Yirmeyah,41,11,"When Yochanan ben Kareach with all the officers of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil Yishmael ben Netanyah had done,"
Yirmeyah,41,12,"Then they took kol ha'anashim, and went to fight with Yishmael ben Netanyah, and found him by the mayim rabbim that are in Giv'on."
Yirmeyah,41,13,"Now it came to pass, that when kol haAm which were with Yishmael saw Yochanan ben Kareach, and all the officers of the forces that were with him, then they were glad."
Yirmeyah,41,14,So kol haAm that Yishmael had carried away captive from Mitzpah turned and went over to Yochanan ben Kareach.
Yirmeyah,41,15,"But Yishmael ben Netanyah escaped from Yochanan with eight anashim, and went over to the Bnei Ammon."
Yirmeyah,41,16,"Then took Yochanan ben Kareach, and all the officers of the forces that were with him, all the she'erit haAm whom he had recovered from Yishmael ben Netanyah, from Mitzpah, after that he had slain Gedalyah ben Achikam, even gevarim anshei hamilchamah, and the nashim, and the children, and the sarisim, whom he had brought from Giv'on;"
Yirmeyah,41,17,"And they departed, and dwelt in the Gerut Kimham, which is near Beit-Lechem, intending to go to Mitzrayim,"
Yirmeyah,41,18,"Because of the Kasdim (Chaldeans) ; for they were afraid of them, because Yishmael ben Netanyah had slain Gedalyahu ben Achikam, whom Melech Bavel made governor in ha'aretz."
Yirmeyah,42,1,"Then all the army officers, and Yochanan Ben Kareach, and Yezanyah Ben Hoshayah, and kol HaAm from the katon even unto the gadol, came near,"
Yirmeyah,42,2,"And said unto Yirmeyah HaNavi, Let, now, techinnatenu (our supplication) be accepted before thee, and pray on our behalf unto Hashem Eloheicha, even on behalf of all this she'erit (remnant) ‚Äî for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes canst see ‚Äî"
Yirmeyah,42,3,"That Hashem Eloheicha may show us the derech wherein we should walk, and the thing that we should do."
Yirmeyah,42,4,"Then Yirmeyah HaNavi said unto them, I have heard you; hineni, I will pray unto Hashem Eloheichem according to your devarim; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing Hashem shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you."
Yirmeyah,42,5,"Then they said to Yirmeyah, Hashem be an ed emes v'ne'eman (true and faithful witness) against us, if we do not act even according to all things for the which Hashem Eloheicha shall send thee to us."
Yirmeyah,42,6,"Whether it be tov, or whether it be rah, we will obey the voice of Hashem Eloheinu, to Whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Hashem Eloheinu."
Yirmeyah,42,7,"And it came to pass after aseret yamim (ten days) , that the Devar Hashem came unto Yirmeyah."
Yirmeyah,42,8,"Then he called Yochanan Ben Kareach, and all the army officers which were with him, and kol HaAm from the katon even to the gadol,"
Yirmeyah,42,9,"And said unto them, Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel, unto Whom ye sent me to present your techinnah before Him;"
Yirmeyah,42,10,"If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you up, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not uproot you; for I relent Me of the ra'ah that I have brought upon you."
Yirmeyah,42,11,"Be not afraid of Melech Bavel, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith Hashem ; for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his yad."
Yirmeyah,42,12,"And I will show rachamim unto you, that he will have compassion upon you, and cause you to return to your own land."
Yirmeyah,42,13,"But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, disobeying the voice of Hashem Eloheichem,"
Yirmeyah,42,14,"Saying, No; but we will go into Eretz Mitzrayim, where we shall see no milchamah, nor hear the sound of the shofar, nor have hunger for lechem; and there will we dwell;"
Yirmeyah,42,15,"And now therefore hear the Devar Hashem , ye She'erit Yehudah (Remnant of Judah) . Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: If ye wholly set your faces to go to Mitzrayim, and go to sojourn there,"
Yirmeyah,42,16,"Then it shall come to pass, that the cherev, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in Eretz Mitzrayim, and the ra'av (famine) , whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Mitzrayim; and there ye shall die."
Yirmeyah,42,17,"So shall it be with all the anashim that set their faces to go into Mitzrayim to sojourn there; they shall die by the cherev, by the ra'av (famine) , and by the dever; and none of them shall remain or escape from the ra'ah (disaster) that I will bring upon them."
Yirmeyah,42,18,"For thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: As Mine anger and My wrath hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Yerushalayim, so shall My wrath be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Mitzrayim; and ye shall be an oath, and a horror, and a kelalah (curse) , and a cherpah; and ye shall see this makom no more."
Yirmeyah,42,19," Hashem hath said concerning you, O ye she'erit Yehudah; Go ye not into Mitzrayim; know certainly that I have warned you, this day."
Yirmeyah,42,20,"For ye acted deceitfully, erring in your nafshot, when ye sent me unto Hashem Eloheichem, saying, Pray on our behalf unto Hashem Eloheinu; and according unto all that Hashem Eloheinu shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it."
Yirmeyah,42,21,"And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of Hashem Eloheichem, nor anything for the which He hath sent me unto you."
Yirmeyah,42,22,"Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the cherev, by the ra'av (famine) , and by the dever, in the makom where ye desire to go and to sojourn."
Yirmeyah,43,1,"And it came to pass, that when Yirmeyah had made an end of speaking unto kol haAm all the divrei Hashem Eloheihem, for which Hashem Eloheihem had sent him to them, even all these words,"
Yirmeyah,43,2,"Then spoke Azaryah ben Hoshayah, Yochanan ben Kareach, and all the anashim ha-zedim, saying unto Yirmeyah, Thou speakest sheker; Hashem Eloheinu hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Mitzrayim to sojourn there;"
Yirmeyah,43,3,"But Baruch ben Neriyah inciteth thee against us, for to deliver us into the yad haKasdim, that they might put us to death, and carry us away into the Golus of Babylon."
Yirmeyah,43,4,"So Yochanan ben Kareach, and all the officers of the forces, and kol haAm, obeyed not the voice of Hashem , to dwell in Eretz Yehudah."
Yirmeyah,43,5,"But Yochanan ben Kareach, and all the officers of the forces, took all the she'erit Yehudah, that were returned from kol haGoyim, where they had been driven there, to dwell in Eretz Yehudah;"
Yirmeyah,43,6,"Even men, and women, and children, and the banot hamelech, and every nefesh that Nevuzaradan, the captain of the imperial guard, had left with Gedalyahu ben Achikam ben Shaphan, and Yirmeyah HaNavi, and Baruch ben Neriyah."
Yirmeyah,43,7,So they came into Eretz Mitzrayim; for they obeyed not the voice of Hashem ; thus came they even as far as Tachpanches.
Yirmeyah,43,8,"Then came the Devar Hashem unto Yirmeyah in Tachpanches, saying,"
Yirmeyah,43,9,"Take avanim gedolim in thine yad, and bury them in the clay in the brick pavement, which is at the entrance of the bais Pharaoh in Tachpanches, before the eyes of the anshei Yehudah;"
Yirmeyah,43,10,"And say unto them, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Hineni, I will send and take Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel, avdi (my servant) , and will set his throne upon these avanim that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them."
Yirmeyah,43,11,"And when he cometh, he shall smite Eretz Mitzrayim, and deliver such as are for mot to mot; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the cherev to the cherev."
Yirmeyah,43,12,"And I will kindle an eish in the batim (houses) of the g-ds of Mitzrayim; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive; and he shall wrap himself with Eretz Mitzrayim, as a ro'eh putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from there in shalom."
Yirmeyah,43,13,"He shall demolish also the matzevot Beit-Shemesh, that is in Eretz Mitzrayim; and the batim (houses) of the g-ds of the Egyptians shall he burn with eish."
Yirmeyah,44,1,"The davar that came to Yirmeyah concerning all the Yehudim which dwell in Eretz Mitzrayim, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tachpanches, and at Noph, and in the country of Patros, saying,"
Yirmeyah,44,2,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel; Ye have seen all the ra'ah that I have brought upon Yerushalayim, and upon all the towns of Yehudah; and, behold, this day they are a ruin, and no one dwelleth therein,"
Yirmeyah,44,3,"Because of their ra'ah (evil) which they have committed to provoke Me to anger, in that they went to burn ketoret, and to serve elohim acherim, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor avoteichem."
Yirmeyah,44,4,"Howbeit I sent unto you all My avadim the Nevi'im, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this to'evah (abominable thing) that I hate."
Yirmeyah,44,5,"But they paid heed not, nor inclined their ozen to turn from their ra'ah (wickedness) , to burn no ketoret unto elohim acherim."
Yirmeyah,44,6,"Wherefore My wrath and Mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the towns of Yehudah and in the streets of Yerushalayim; and they are become a desolate ruin, as at this day."
Yirmeyah,44,7,"Therefore now thus saith Hashem Elohei Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Why commit ye this ra'ah gedolah against your nefashot, to cut off from you ish and isha, olel (child) and yonek (infant) , out of Yehudah, to leave you no she'erit (remnant);"
Yirmeyah,44,8,"In that ye provoke Me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning ketoret unto elohim acherim in Eretz Mitzrayim, where ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a kelalah (curse) and a cherpah (reproach) among kol HaGoyim of ha'aretz?"
Yirmeyah,44,9,"Have ye forgotten the ra'ot (wickednesses) of avoteichem, and the ra'ot of the melachim of Yehudah, and the ra'ot of their nashim, and your own ra'ot, and the ra'ot of your nashim, which they have committed in Eretz Yehudah, and in the streets of Yerushalayim?"
Yirmeyah,44,10,"They are not contrite even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in My torah, nor in My chukkot, that I set before you and before avoteichem."
Yirmeyah,44,11,"Therefore thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Hineni, I will set My face against you for ra'ah, and to cut off kol Yehudah."
Yirmeyah,44,12,"And I will take the she'erit (remnant) of Yehudah, that have set their faces to go into Eretz Mitzrayim to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in Eretz Mitzrayim; they shall even be consumed by the cherev and by the ra'av (famine) ; they shall die, from the katon even unto the gadol, by the cherev and by the ra'av; and they shall be an object of cursing, and a horror, and a kelalah, and a cherpah."
Yirmeyah,44,13,"For I will punish them that dwell in Eretz Mitzrayim, just as I have punished Yerushalayim, by the cherev, by the ra'av, and by the dever;"
Yirmeyah,44,14,"So that none of the she'erit (remnant) of Yehudah, which are gone into Eretz Mitzrayim to sojourn there, shall escape or survive, that they should return into Eretz Yehudah, to the which they lift up [in desire] their nefesh to return to dwell there; for none shall return but such as shall escape."
Yirmeyah,44,15,"Then all the anashim which knew that their nashim had burned ketoret unto elohim acherim, and all the nashim that stood by, a kahal gadol (great multitude) , even kol HaAm that dwelt in Eretz Mitzrayim, in Patros, answered Yirmeyah, saying,"
Yirmeyah,44,16,"As for the davar that thou hast spoken unto us b'Shem Hashem , we will not pay heed unto thee."
Yirmeyah,44,17,"But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn ketoret unto the Malkat HaShomayim (the Queen of Heaven) , and to pour out nesakhim (drink offerings) unto her, as we have done, we, and Avoteinu, our Melachim, and our Sarim, in the towns of Yehudah, and in the streets of Yerushalayim; for then we had plenty of lechem, and were tovim (well off) , and saw no ra'ah."
Yirmeyah,44,18,"But since we left off burning ketoret to the Malkat HaShomayim, and to pour out nesakhim unto her, we have lacked all things, and have been consumed by the cherev and by the ra'av."
Yirmeyah,44,19,"And when we burned ketoret to the Malkat HaShomayim, and poured out nesakhim unto her, did we make for her in her image cakes, and pour out nesakhim unto her, without our anashim?"
Yirmeyah,44,20,"Then Yirmeyah said unto kol HaAm, to the gevarim, and to the nashim, and to kol HaAm which had given him that answer, saying,"
Yirmeyah,44,21,"The ketoret that ye burned in the towns of Yehudah, and in the streets of Yerushalayim, ye, and avoteichem, your melachim, and your sarim, and the am ha'aretz, did not Hashem remember them, and came it not into His mind?"
Yirmeyah,44,22,"So that Hashem could no longer bear, because of the wickedness of your doings, and because of the to'evot (abominations) which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and a ruin, and a kelalah, without an inhabitant, as at this day."
Yirmeyah,44,23,"Because ye have burned ketoret, and because ye have sinned against Hashem , and have not obeyed the voice of Hashem , nor walked in His torah, nor in His chukkot, nor in His edot; therefore this ra'ah has happened unto you, as at this day."
Yirmeyah,44,24,"Moreover Yirmeyah said unto kol HaAm, and to all the nashim, Hear the Devar Hashem , all Yehudah that are in the Eretz Mitzrayim,"
Yirmeyah,44,25,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel, saying: Ye and your nashim have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your yad, saying, We will surely perform nedareinu (our vows) that we have vowed, to burn ketoret to the Malkat HaShomayim, and to pour out nesakhim unto her; ye will surely accomplish your nedarim (vows) , and surely perform your nedarim."
Yirmeyah,44,26,"Therefore hear ye the Devar Hashem , all Yehudah that dwell in Eretz Mitzrayim: Hineni, I have sworn biShmi HaGadol (by My great Name) , saith Hashem , that Shmi shall no more be named in the mouth of any Ish Yehudah in all Eretz Mitzrayim, saying, Adonoi Hashem liveth."
Yirmeyah,44,27,"Hineni, I will watch over them for ra'ah, and not for tovah; and Kol Ish Yehudah that are in Eretz Mitzrayim shall be consumed by the cherev and by ra'av, until there be an end of them."
Yirmeyah,44,28,"Yet a small number that escape the cherev shall return out of Eretz Mitzrayim into Eretz Yehudah, and all the she'erit (remnant) Yehudah, that are gone into Eretz Mitzrayim to sojourn there, shall know whose davar shall stand, Mine, or theirs."
Yirmeyah,44,29,"And this shall be the ot (sign) unto you, saith Hashem , that I will punish you in this makom, that ye may know that My Davar shall surely stand against you for ra'ah:"
Yirmeyah,44,30,"Thus saith Hashem ; Hineni, I will give Pharaoh Chophra Melech Mitzrayim into the yad of his oyevim, and into the yad of them that seek his nefesh; just as I gave Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah into the yad of Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel, his oyev, and that sought his nefesh (life)."
Yirmeyah,45,1,"The Davar that Yirmeyah HaNavi spoke unto Baruch ben Neriyah, when he had written these words in a sefer at the mouth of Yirmeyah, in the fourth year of Y'hoyakim ben Yoshiyah Melech Yehudah, saying,"
Yirmeyah,45,2,"Thus saith Hashem , Elohei Yisroel, unto thee, O Baruch:"
Yirmeyah,45,3,"Thou didst say, Oy to me now! For Hashem hath added sorrow to my machovim (sorrows) ; I am worn out in my groaning, and I find no menuchah."
Yirmeyah,45,4,"Thus shalt thou say unto him, Hashem saith thus: Hinei, that which I have built will I tear down, and that which I have planted I will uproot, even this kol haAretz."
Yirmeyah,45,5,"And seekest thou gedolot (great things) for thyself? Seek them not; for, hineni, I will bring ra'ah upon kol basar, saith Hashem ; but thy nefesh will I give unto thee for plunder in kol mekomot (all places) whither thou goest."
Yirmeyah,46,1,The Davar Hashem which came to Yirmeyah HaNavi against the Goyim;
Yirmeyah,46,2,"Against Mitzrayim, against the army of Pharaoh Nekho Melech Mitzrayim, which was by the river Euphrates in Karkemish (Carchemish) , which Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel defeated in the fourth year of Y'hoyakim Ben Yoshiyah Melech Yehudah."
Yirmeyah,46,3,"Order ye the mogen and tzinnah (large shield) , and draw near to milchamah."
Yirmeyah,46,4,"Harness the susim; and get up, ye parashim (horsemen) , and stand forth with your helmets; polish the spears, and put on the armor."
Yirmeyah,46,5,"What do I see? They are filled with terror and retreat! And their gibborim are beaten down, and are fled speedily, and look not back; for fear was all around, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,46,6,"Let not the swift flee away, nor the gibbor escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates."
Yirmeyah,46,7,"Who is this that riseth like the Nile, whose mayim surge like the rivers?"
Yirmeyah,46,8,"Mitzrayim riseth up like the Nile, and his mayim surge like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover eretz (earth) ; I will destroy cities and the inhabitants thereof."
Yirmeyah,46,9,"Come up, ye susim; and rage, ye chariots; and let the Gibborim come forth; Kush and Put, that handle the mogen; and the Ludim, that handle and bend the keshet."
Yirmeyah,46,10,"For this is the Yom Adonoi Hashem Tzva'os, a day of vengeance, that He may avenge Him on His adversaries; and the cherev shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their dahm; for Adonoi Hashem Tzva'os hath a zevach in eretz tzafon by the river Euphrates."
Yirmeyah,46,11,"Go up into Gil'ad, and take balm, O Betulat Bat Mitzrayim; in vain shalt thou use many refu'ot (healing remedies, medicines) ; for thou shalt not be healed."
Yirmeyah,46,12,"The Goyim have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled ha'aretz; for the gibbor hath stumbled against the gibbor, and they are fallen both together."
Yirmeyah,46,13,"The Davar that Hashem spoke to Yirmeyah HaNavi, how Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel would come and strike Eretz Mitzrayim."
Yirmeyah,46,14,"Declare ye in Mitzrayim, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tachpanches; say ye, Stand fast, prepare thee; for the cherev shall devour all around thee."
Yirmeyah,46,15,"Why was it swept away? They stood not, because Hashem did drive them."
Yirmeyah,46,16,"He made many to stumble, indeed, one fell upon another; and they said, Arise, and let us go back to ammenu (our own people) , and to eretz moladteinu (land of our birth) , from the oppressing cherev."
Yirmeyah,46,17,"They did cry there, Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim is but a noise; he hath passed the mo'ed (time appointed)."
Yirmeyah,46,18,"As I live, saith HaMelech, Hashem Tzva'os Shmo, Surely as Tavor is among the harim, and as Carmel by the yam, so shall he come."
Yirmeyah,46,19,"O thou Bat dwelling in Mitzrayim, prepare thyself to go into Golus; for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant."
Yirmeyah,46,20,"Mitzrayim is like a very fair eglah, but a gadfly comes; it comes out of the tzafon."
Yirmeyah,46,21,"Also her mercenaries are in the midst of her like young calves of the stall; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together; they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of their pekuddat."
Yirmeyah,46,22,"The noise thereof shall go like a nachash; for they [her enemies] shall march in force, and come against her with axes, as choppers of wood."
Yirmeyah,46,23,"They shall cut down her forest, saith Hashem , though it cannot be searched out; because they are more in number than the arbeh (locust) , innumerable."
Yirmeyah,46,24,The Bat Mitzrayim shall be ashamed; she shall be delivered into the yad of the Am Tzafon (People of the North).
Yirmeyah,46,25," Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel, saith; Hineni, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Mitzrayim, with their elohim, and their melachim; even Pharaoh, and all the botechim (ones trusting) in him;"
Yirmeyah,46,26,"And I will deliver them into the yad of those that seek their nefesh, and into the yad of Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel, and into the yad of his avadim; and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the yemei kedem (days of old) , saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,46,27,"But fear not thou, O Avdi Ya'akov, and be not dismayed, O Yisroel; for, hineni, I will save thee from afar off, and thy zera from the land of their captivity; and Ya'akov shall return, and be in rest and securely at ease, and none shall make him afraid."
Yirmeyah,46,28,"Fear thou not, O Ya'akov Avdi, saith Hashem ; for I am with thee; for I will make a full end of kol HaGoyim where I have scattered thee; but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee with mishpat (justice) ; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished."
Yirmeyah,47,1,"The Devar Hashem that came to Yirmeyah HaNavi against the Pelishtim (Philistines) , before Pharaoh smote Azah (Gaza)."
Yirmeyah,47,2,"Thus saith Hashem : Hinei, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein; the Ir, and them that dwell therein; then the adam shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail."
Yirmeyah,47,3,"At the noise of the stamping of the hooves of his mighty steeds, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels, the avot shall not look back to their banim for the limpness of their hands;"
Yirmeyah,47,4,"Because of the Yom HaBah for destroying all the Pelishtim (Philistines) , and to cut off from Tzor and Tzidon every helper that remaineth; for Hashem will destroy the Pelishtim (Philistines) , the remnant of the coast of Caphtor."
Yirmeyah,47,5,"The shaved head has come upon Azah (Gaza) ; Ashkelon is silenced. Remnant of their valley, how long wilt thou cut thyself?"
Yirmeyah,47,6,"O thou cherev Hashem , how long will it be until thou be quiet? Put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still."
Yirmeyah,47,7,"How can it be quiet, seeing Hashem hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea coast? There hath He appointed it."
Yirmeyah,48,1,"Against Moav thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Hoy (woe, doom) unto Nevo! For it is made havoc; Kiryatayim is shamed and captured; Misgav is shamed and dismayed."
Yirmeyah,48,2,"There shall be no more tehillah (praise) of Moav; in Cheshbon they have plotted ra'ah against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also thou shalt be silenced, O Madmein; the cherev shall pursue thee."
Yirmeyah,48,3,"A voice of crying shall be from Choronayim, havoc and shever gadol (great destruction)."
Yirmeyah,48,4,Moav is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
Yirmeyah,48,5,For in the Ascent of Luchit continual weeping shall go up; for in the descent of Choronayim the anguished ones have heard a cry of shever (destruction).
Yirmeyah,48,6,"Flee, save your nefesh, and be like Aro'er in the midbar."
Yirmeyah,48,7,"For because thou hast trusted in thy ma'asim (works) and in thy otzarot, thou shalt also be captured; and Kemosh shall go forth into Golus with his kohanim and his sarim together."
Yirmeyah,48,8,"And the destroyer shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the emek (valley) also shall perish, and the plain shall be shmad (destroyed) , as Hashem hath spoken."
Yirmeyah,48,9,"Give wings unto Moav, that it may flee and get away; for the towns thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein."
Yirmeyah,48,10,"Cursed be he that doeth the work of Hashem remiyyah (deceitfully) , and cursed be he that keepeth back his cherev from bloodshed."
Yirmeyah,48,11,"Moav hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his wine dregs, and hath not been emptied from keli (vessel) to keli, neither hath he gone into Golus: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed."
Yirmeyah,48,12,"But, hinei, the days come, saith Hashem , that I will send unto him wine pourers, that shall pour him out, and shall empty his kelim (vessels) , and smash their jars."
Yirmeyah,48,13,"And Moav shall be ashamed of Kemosh, just as Bais Yisroel was ashamed of Beit-El, their confidence."
Yirmeyah,48,14,"How say ye, We are gibborim and anshei chayil for the milchamah?"
Yirmeyah,48,15,"Moav is destroyed, and gone up out of her towns, and his chosen bochurim are gone down to the slaughter, saith HaMelech Hashem Tzva'os Shmo."
Yirmeyah,48,16,"The calamity of Moav is near at hand, and his affliction hasteth fast."
Yirmeyah,48,17,"All ye that are around him, bemoan him; and all ye that know shmo, say, How is the matteh oz (strong staff) broken, and the beautiful rod!"
Yirmeyah,48,18,"Thou Bat that dost inhabit Divon, come down from thy kavod, and sit on parched ground; for the plunderer of Moav shall come upon thee, and he shall destroy thy strongholds."
Yirmeyah,48,19,"O inhabitant of Aro'er, stand by the derech, and watch; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What has happened?"
Yirmeyah,48,20,"Moav is shamed; for it is broken down: wail and cry out; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moav is destroyed,"
Yirmeyah,48,21,"And mishpat is come upon the plain; upon Cholon, and upon Yahtzah, and upon Mepha'at,"
Yirmeyah,48,22,"And upon Divon, and upon Nevo, and upon Beit-Divlatayim,"
Yirmeyah,48,23,"And upon Kiryatayim, and upon Beit-Gamul, and upon Beit-Me'on,"
Yirmeyah,48,24,"And upon Keriyot, and upon Botzrah, and upon all the towns of Eretz Moav, far or near."
Yirmeyah,48,25,"The keren of Moav is cut off, and his zero'a is broken, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,48,26,"Make ye him drunken; for he magnified himself against Hashem ; Moav also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision."
Yirmeyah,48,27,"For was not Yisroel a derision unto thee? Was he found among ganavim (thieves) ? For since thou spoke of him, thou dost scornful head wagging."
Yirmeyah,48,28,"O ye that dwell in Moav, leave the towns, and dwell in the rock, and be like the yonah that maketh her nest in the sides of the cave ºs mouth."
Yirmeyah,48,29,"We have heard the ga'on Moav, (he is exceeding proud) , his highmindedness, and his conceit, and his ga'avah, and the haughtiness of his lev."
Yirmeyah,48,30,"I know his insolence, saith Hashem ; but it shall not be so; his boasts have made nothing right."
Yirmeyah,48,31,"Therefore will I wail for Moav, and I will cry out for all Moav; I shall moan for the anashim of Kir-Charesh."
Yirmeyah,48,32,"O gefen (vine) of Sivmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Yazer; thy branches are spread over the yam, they reach even to the yam Yazer; the plunderer is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage."
Yirmeyah,48,33,"And simchah and gladness is taken from the carmel, and from Eretz Moav, and I have caused yayin to fail from the winepresses; none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall not be [joyful] shouting."
Yirmeyah,48,34,"From the cry of Cheshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Yahatz, have they uttered their voice, from Tzoar even unto Choronayim, as Eglat-Shelishiyah; for the mayim also of Nimrim shall be dried up."
Yirmeyah,48,35,"Moreover I will cause to cease in Moav, saith Hashem , him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth ketoret to his elohim."
Yirmeyah,48,36,"Therefore Mine lev shall wail for Moav like flutes, and Mine lev shall wail like flutes for the anashim of Kir-Charesh; because the riches that he hath gotten are perished."
Yirmeyah,48,37,"For every rosh shall be shaved, and every zakan (beard) cut: upon all the hands shall be slashes, and upon the loins sackcloth."
Yirmeyah,48,38,"There shall be lamentation generally upon all the gagot (roofs) of Moav, and in the streets thereof; for I have broken Moav like a keli (vessel) wherein is no chefets (pleasure) saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,48,39,"They shall wail, saying, How is it shattered! How hath Moav turned the back with shame! So shall Moav be a laughingstock and a horror to all them about him."
Yirmeyah,48,40,"For thus saith Hashem ; Hinei, one shall fly like the nesher, and shall spread his wings over Moav."
Yirmeyah,48,41,"Keriyot is captured, and the strongholds are taken, and the lev gibborim in Moav at that day shall be as the lev isha in her birth pangs."
Yirmeyah,48,42,"And Moav shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against Hashem."
Yirmeyah,48,43,"Pachad (fear) , and the pakhat (pit) , and the pach (snare) , shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of Moav, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,48,44,"He that fleeth from the pachad (terror) shall fall into the pakhat (pit) ; and he that getteth up out of the pakhat shall be caught in the pach (snare) ; for I will bring upon it, even upon Moav, the shnat (year of) their pekuddah (visitation) , saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,48,45,"They that fled stood under the tzel (shadow) of Cheshbon without ko'ach; for an eish shall come forth out of Cheshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sichon, and shall devour the forehead of Moav, and the crown of the head of the bnei sha'on (sons of tumult)."
Yirmeyah,48,46,"Oy be unto thee, O Moav! The people of Kemosh perisheth; for thy banim are taken captives, and thy banot into captivity."
Yirmeyah,48,47,"Yet will I bring again the captives of Moav in the acharit hayamim, saith Hashem . Hinei, the mishpat Moav (judgment of Moab)."
Yirmeyah,49,1,"Concerning Bnei Ammon, thus saith Hashem : Hath Yisroel no banim? Hath he no yoresh (heir) ? Why then doth Malcam (Molech) inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his towns?"
Yirmeyah,49,2,"Therefore, hinei, the days come, saith Hashem , that I will cause an alarm of milchamah to be heard in Rabbah of Bnei Ammon; and it shall become a desolate tel (mound) , and her banot shall be burned with eish: then shall Yisroel dispossess his dispossessors, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,49,3,"Wail, O Cheshbon, for Ai is plundered: cry out, ye banot of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and rush to and fro inside the walls; for Malcam (Molech) shall go into Golus, and his kohanim and his sarim together."
Yirmeyah,49,4,"Why gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing emek (valley) , O Bat hashovevah (backsliding Daughter) ? That trusted in her otzarot, saying, Who shall come unto Me?"
Yirmeyah,49,5,"Hineni, I will bring a pachad (terror) upon thee, saith Adonoi Hashem Tzva'os, from all those that be around thee; and ye shall be driven out, every ish before him; and none shall gather up the fugitive."
Yirmeyah,49,6,"And afterward I will bring back the captivity of the Bnei Ammon, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,49,7,"Concerning Edom, thus saith Hashem Tzva'os; Is chochmah no more in Teman? Is etzah perished from the prudent? Is their chochmah vanished?"
Yirmeyah,49,8,"Flee ye, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esav upon him, the time that I will visit [to punish] him."
Yirmeyah,49,9,"If grape gatherers come to thee, would they not leave some grape gleanings? If ganavim balailah (thieves by night) , they will destroy only till they have enough."
Yirmeyah,49,10,"But I have stripped Esav bare, I have uncovered his hiding places, and he shall not be able to hide himself; his zera are plundered, and his brethren, and his shchenim (neighbors) and he is no more."
Yirmeyah,49,11,"Leave thy yatomim (fatherless, orphans) , I will preserve them alive; and let thy almanot trust in Me."
Yirmeyah,49,12,"For thus saith Hashem : Hinei, they whose mishpat was not to drink of the Kos have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? Thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it."
Yirmeyah,49,13,"For I have sworn by Myself, saith Hashem , that Botzrah shall become a desolation, a cherpah, a reproach, and a kelalah; and all the towns thereof shall be perpetual ruins."
Yirmeyah,49,14,"I have heard a message from Hashem , and an envoy is sent unto the Goyim, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the milchamah."
Yirmeyah,49,15,"For, hinei, I will make thee katon among the Goyim, and despised among adam."
Yirmeyah,49,16,"Thy fierceness hath deceived thee, and the zadon (pride, malice) of thine lev, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill; though thou shouldest make thy ken (nest) as high as the nesher, I will bring thee down from there, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,49,17,"Also Edom shall be a horror; every one that goeth by it shall be appalled, and shall hiss at all the makkot (wounds, blows) thereof."
Yirmeyah,49,18,"As in the overthrow of Sodom and Amora (Gomorrah) and the neighboring towns thereof, saith Hashem , no ish shall abide there, neither shall a ben adam dwell in it."
Yirmeyah,49,19,"Hinei, he shall come up like an aryeh from the thicket of the Yarden against the rich pastureland; but I will suddenly make him run away from her; and who is Bachur (Chosen one) , that I may appoint over her? Mi khamoni (who is like Me) ? And who will arraign Me? And who is that Ro'eh (shepherd) that will stand before Me?"
Yirmeyah,49,20,"Therefore hear the etzat Hashem , that He hath planned against Edom; and His purposes, that He hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman; Surely the young ones of the tzon shall drag them away; surely He shall make their habitation desolate because of them."
Yirmeyah,49,21,"Ha'aretz shakes at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in Yam Suf."
Yirmeyah,49,22,"Hinei, He shall come up and fly like the nesher, and spread His wings over Botzrah; and in that day shall the lev of the Gibborim of Edom be as the lev of an isha in her birth pangs."
Yirmeyah,49,23,"Concerning Damascus: Chamat is shamed, and Arpad, for they have heard bad news; they are fainthearted; there is anxiety on the yam (sea) ; it cannot be quiet."
Yirmeyah,49,24,"Damascus has grown feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath gripped her; anguish and chavalim (pains) have taken her, as a woman in travail."
Yirmeyah,49,25,"How is it that the Ir Tehillah is not deserted, the town of My joy!"
Yirmeyah,49,26,"Therefore her bochurim shall fall in her streets, and all the anshei milchamah shall be destroyed in that day, saith Hashem Tzva'os."
Yirmeyah,49,27,"And I will kindle an eish in the chomat Damascus, and it shall consume the fortresses of Ben-hadad."
Yirmeyah,49,28,"Concerning Kedar, and concerning the mamlechot of Chatzor, which Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel shall strike, thus saith Hashem ; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and plunder the Bnei Kedem."
Yirmeyah,49,29,"Their ohalim and their tzon shall they take away; they shall carry off for themselves their tent curtains, and all their kelim (vessels) , their gemalim (camels) ; and they shall cry unto them, Magor (terror, fear) is on every side."
Yirmeyah,49,30,"Flee, get you far off, dwell in the depths, O ye inhabitants of Chatzor, saith Hashem ; for Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel hath plotted an etzah (plot, plan, counsel) against you, and hath conceived a plan against you."
Yirmeyah,49,31,"Arise, get you up unto the nation which is at ease, that dwelleth securely, saith Hashem , which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone."
Yirmeyah,49,32,"And their gemalim (camels) shall be for plunder, and the multitude of their mikneh (herds) a plunder; and I will scatter unto kol ruach (all winds) them that cut off the [hair] corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,49,33,"And Chatzor shall be a ma'on (dwelling) for jackals, and a desolation ad olam (forever) ; there shall no ish abide there, nor any ben adam dwell in it."
Yirmeyah,49,34,"The Devar Hashem that came to Yirmeyah HaNavi against Eilam in the beginning of the reign of Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah, saying,"
Yirmeyah,49,35,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os; Hineni: I will break the keshet (bow, power) of Eilam, the mainstay of their might."
Yirmeyah,49,36,"And upon Eilam will I bring the arba ruchot (four winds) from the four quarters of Shomayim, and will scatter them toward all those ruchot; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Eilam shall not go."
Yirmeyah,49,37,"For I will cause Eilam to be dismayed before their oyevim, and before them that seek their nefesh; and I will bring ra'ah upon them, even My charon af, saith Hashem ; and I will send the cherev after them, till I have consumed them:"
Yirmeyah,49,38,"And I will set My Kisse in Eilam, and will destroy from there melech and the sarim, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,49,39,"Yet it shall come to pass in the acharit hayamim, that I will bring again the captivity of Eilam, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,50,1,The Davar that Hashem spoke against Bavel and against Eretz Kasdim (Chaldeans) by Yirmeyah HaNavi.
Yirmeyah,50,2,"Declare ye among the Goyim, and publish, and lift up a nes (banner) ; publish, and conceal not; say, Bavel is captured, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed; her atzabim (images) are shamed, her gilulim (idols) are dismayed."
Yirmeyah,50,3,"For out of the tzafon (north) there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land a horror, and none shall dwell therein; they shall wander, they shall depart, both adam and behemah."
Yirmeyah,50,4,"In those yamim, and in that time, saith Hashem , the Bnei Yisroel shall go, they and the Bnei Yehudah together, in tears weeping; they shall go, and seek Hashem Eloheihem."
Yirmeyah,50,5,"They shall ask the derech to Tziyon with their faces turned toward it, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to Hashem in a Brit Olam that shall not be forgotten."
Yirmeyah,50,6,"My people hath been tzon ovedot (lost sheep) ; their ro'im (shepherds) have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the harim; they have wandered from har to givah (hill) , they have forgotten their resting place."
Yirmeyah,50,7,"All that found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against Hashem , the naveh tzedek, even Hashem , the mikveh Avoteihem."
Yirmeyah,50,8,"Flee out of the midst of Bavel, and go forth out of the Eretz Kasdim (Chaldeans) , and leave as the male goats before the tzon."
Yirmeyah,50,9,"For, hinei, I will stir up and cause to come up against Bavel a Kahal Goyim Gedolim from eretz tzafon (land of the north) ; and they shall set themselves in array against her; from there she shall be captured; their khitzim (arrows) shall be as of a gibbor maskil, one that does not return empty-handed."
Yirmeyah,50,10,"And Kasdim (Chaldea) shall be a plunder: all that plunder her shall have their fill, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,50,11,"Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye pillagers of Mine nachalah, because ye frisk about as the eglah (heifer) threshing grain, and neigh like stallions;"
Yirmeyah,50,12,"Your em shall be deeply ashamed; she that bore you shall be disgraced; hinei, the least of the Goyim shall be a midbar, a dry land, and an aravah."
Yirmeyah,50,13,"Because of the wrath of Hashem it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate; every one that passeth by Bavel shall be horrified, and hiss at all her makkot."
Yirmeyah,50,14,"Put yourselves in array against Bavel all around; all ye that bend the keshet, shoot at her, spare no khetz (arrow) ; for she hath sinned against Hashem."
Yirmeyah,50,15,"Shout against her all around; she hath surrendered her yad; her bulwarks are fallen, her chomot (walls) are torn down; for it is the vengeance of Hashem ; take vengeance upon her; just as she hath done, do unto her."
Yirmeyah,50,16,"Cut off the sower from Bavel, and him that reapeth with the magal (sickle) in the time of katzir; for fear of the oppressing cherev they shall turn every ish to his people, and they shall flee every ish to his own land."
Yirmeyah,50,17,Yisroel is a seh pezurah (scattered sheep) ; the aryot (lions) have driven him away; first Melech Ashur (King of Assyria) hath devoured him; and last this Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel hath broken his atzmot.
Yirmeyah,50,18,"Therefore thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Hineni, I will punish Melech Bavel and his land, as I have punished Melech Ashur."
Yirmeyah,50,19,"And I will bring Yisroel back to his naveh (habitation) , and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his nefesh shall be satisfied upon Har Ephrayim and Gil'ad."
Yirmeyah,50,20,"In those yamim, and at that time, saith Hashem , the avon Yisroel shall be searched for, and there shall be none; and the chattot Yehudah, and they shall not be found; for I will pardon them whom I preserve as remnant."
Yirmeyah,50,21,"Go up against Eretz Meratayim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod; lay waste and utterly destroy after them, saith Hashem , and do according to all that I have commanded thee."
Yirmeyah,50,22,"A sound of milchamah is in ha'aretz, and of shever gadol (great destruction)."
Yirmeyah,50,23,How is the patish (hammer) of kol ha'aretz (the whole earth) shattered and broken! How is Bavel become a desolation among the Goyim!
Yirmeyah,50,24,"I have laid a trap for thee, and thou art indeed caught, O Bavel, and thou wast not aware; thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against Hashem."
Yirmeyah,50,25," Hashem hath opened His armory, and hath brought forth the weapons of His indignation; for this is the work of Adonoi Hashem Tzva'os in Eretz Kasdim."
Yirmeyah,50,26,"Come against her from afar, open her storehouses; pile her up like heaps of grain, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be she'erit (remnant)."
Yirmeyah,50,27,"Slay all her bulls; let them go down latevach (to the slaughter); woe unto them! For their day is come, the time of their visitation [for punishment]."
Yirmeyah,50,28,"The voice of them that flee and escape as fugitives out of Eretz Bavel, to declare in Tziyon the vengeance of Hashem Eloheinu, the vengeance of His Heikhal."
Yirmeyah,50,29,"Call together the archers against Bavel; all ye that bend the keshet, encamp against it all around; let none thereof escape; repay her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her; for she hath arrogantly defied Hashem Kadosh Yisroel."
Yirmeyah,50,30,"Therefore shall her bochurim fall in the streets, and all her anshei milchamah shall be destroyed in that day, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,50,31,"Hineni, I am against thee, O thou zadon (proud one) , saith Adonoi Hashem Tzva'os; for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee [for punishment]."
Yirmeyah,50,32,"And the zadon shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will kindle an eish in his towns, and it shall devour all around him."
Yirmeyah,50,33,Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os; The Bnei Yisroel and the Bnei Yehudah were oppressed together; and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.
Yirmeyah,50,34,"Their Go'el is chazak (strong), Hashem Tzva'os Shmo: He shall thoroughly defend their cause, so that He may bring rest to ha'aretz, and disquiet the inhabitants of Bavel."
Yirmeyah,50,35,"A cherev is upon the Kasdim (Chaldeans) , saith Hashem , and upon the inhabitants of Bavel, and upon her sarim, and upon her chachamim."
Yirmeyah,50,36,A cherev is upon the diviners; and they shall become fools; a cherev is upon her gibborim; and they shall be dismayed.
Yirmeyah,50,37,"A cherev is upon their susim, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mixed rabble that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as nashim; a cherev is upon her otzarot; and they shall be plundered."
Yirmeyah,50,38,"A chorev (drought) is upon her mayim; and they shall be dried up; for it is the eretz pesalim (land of idols) , and they go mad over idols."
Yirmeyah,50,39,"Therefore the wild animals of the desert with the hyenas shall dwell in her, and the ostriches shall dwell therein; and it shall be no more inhabited lanetzach (forever) ; neither shall it be dwelt in from dor vador."
Yirmeyah,50,40,"As Elohim overthrew Sodom and Amora (Gomorrah) and the neighboring towns thereof, saith Hashem ; so shall no ish abide there, neither shall any ben adam dwell therein."
Yirmeyah,50,41,"Hinei, an am (people, army) shall come from the tzafon (north) , and a Goy Gadol, and melachim rabbim shall be stirred up from the ends of the earth."
Yirmeyah,50,42,"They shall wield keshet and spear; they are cruel, and shall show no rachamim; their voice shall roar like the yam, and they shall ride upon susim, every one put in array, like an ish for the milchamah, against thee, O Bat Bavel."
Yirmeyah,50,43,"Melech Bavel hath heard the report of them, and his hands fell feeble; anguish took hold of him, and labor pangs as of a woman in travail."
Yirmeyah,50,44,"Hinei, like an aryeh (lion) coming up from the thicket of the Yarden unto perennial pastures, I will make them suddenly run away from her; and who is the Bachur (Chosen One) that over her I will appoint? For who is like Me? And who can arraign Me? And who is that Ro'eh that will stand before Me?"
Yirmeyah,50,45,"Therefore hear ye the etzah of Hashem , that He hath planned against Bavel; and His purposes, that He hath purposed against the Eretz Kasdim; Surely the little ones of the tzon shall be dragged away; surely He shall make their naveh (pasture) desolate because of them."
Yirmeyah,50,46,"At the noise of the capture of Bavel ha'aretz (the earth) is shaken, and the outcry is heard among the Goyim."
Yirmeyah,51,1,"Thus saith Hashem : Hineni, I will stir up against Bavel, and against them that dwell in Lev Kamai a ruach mashchit (spirit of destruction);"
Yirmeyah,51,2,"And will send unto Bavel winnowers, that shall blow her chaff away, and shall empty her land; for in the Yom Ra'ah (Day of Disaster) they shall be against her on every side."
Yirmeyah,51,3,"Against her let the archer bend his keshet, and against her let him rise up in his armor; and spare ye not her bochurim; destroy ye utterly all her army."
Yirmeyah,51,4,"Thus the slain shall fall in the Eretz Kasdim, and they that are thrust through in her streets."
Yirmeyah,51,5,"For Yisroel hath not been forsaken nor Yehudah by Elohav, by Hashem Tzva'os; though their land be filled with asham (guilt) against Kadosh Yisroel."
Yirmeyah,51,6,"Flee out of the midst of Bavel, and deliver every ish his nefesh; be not slain because of her avon; for this is the time of Hashem  ºs vengeance; He will render unto her a full recompence."
Yirmeyah,51,7,"Bavel hath been a Kos Zahav in the yad Hashem , that made kol ha'aretz drunken; the Goyim drank of her yayin; therefore the Goyim go mad."
Yirmeyah,51,8,"Bavel is suddenly fallen and broken; wail for her; take balm for her pain, perhaps she may be healed."
Yirmeyah,51,9,"We would have healed Bavel, but she cannot be healed; forsake her, and let us go every ish into his own country; for her mishpat reacheth unto Shomayim, and is lifted up even to the skies."
Yirmeyah,51,10," Hashem hath brought forth tzidkoteinu (our righteousness, vindication) ; come, and let us declare in Tziyon the ma'aseh Hashem Eloheinu."
Yirmeyah,51,11,"Sharpen the khitzim (arrows) ; take up the shields; Hashem hath stirred up the ruach of the melachim of the Medes: for His mezimah (plan) is against Bavel, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of Hashem , the vengeance for His Heikhal."
Yirmeyah,51,12,"Lift up the nes (banner) upon the chomat Bavel, reinforce the mishmeret (guard) , station the shomrim (watchmen) , prepare the ambushes; for Hashem hath both devised and done that which He spoke against the inhabitants of Bavel."
Yirmeyah,51,13,"O thou that dwellest upon mayim rabbim, abundant in otzarot, thine end is come, and the cubit of thy being cut off."
Yirmeyah,51,14," Hashem Tzva'os hath sworn by His Nefesh, saying, Surely I will fill thee with adam, as with locusts; and they shall lift up a shout against thee."
Yirmeyah,51,15,"He hath made Eretz by His ko'ach, He hath established the tevel by His chochmah, and hath stretched out Shomayim by His tevunah."
Yirmeyah,51,16,"When He thundereth His voice, there is a tumult of mayim in Shomayim; and He bringeth up clouds from the ends of ha'aretz; He maketh lightnings with matar, and bringeth forth the ruach out of his otzarot."
Yirmeyah,51,17,"Kol adam is dull-hearted and without da'as; every goldsmith is shamed by the pesel; for his nesekh (molten image) is sheker, and there is no ruach in them."
Yirmeyah,51,18,"They are hevel (futile, vain) , the work of delusion; in the time of their pekudah they shall perish."
Yirmeyah,51,19,The Chelek Ya'akov (Portion of Jacob) is not like them; for the Yotzer (Maker) of all things is He; and Yisroel is the Shevet of His nachalah: Hashem Tzva'os Shmo.
Yirmeyah,51,20,"Thou art my battle ax and klei milchamah (weapons of war) ; for with thee will I break in pieces the Goyim, and with thee will I destroy mamlechot (kingdoms);"
Yirmeyah,51,21,And with thee will I break in pieces the sus and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the merkavah and his rider;
Yirmeyah,51,22,With thee also will I break in pieces ish and isha; and with thee will I break in pieces zaken and na'ar; and with thee will I break in pieces the bochur and the betulah;
Yirmeyah,51,23,I will also break in pieces with thee the ro'eh and his eder; and with thee will I break in pieces the ikkar (farmer) and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces pachot (rulers) and seganim (officials).
Yirmeyah,51,24,"And I will render unto Bavel and to all the inhabitants of Kasdim all their ra'ah that they have done in Tziyon in your sight, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,51,25,"Hineni, I am against thee, O Har HaMashchit (Destroying Mountain) , saith Hashem , which destroyest kol ha'aretz; and I will stretch out Mine Yad upon thee, and roll thee down from the cliffs, and will make thee a har serefah (burned out mountain)."
Yirmeyah,51,26,"And they shall not take of thee an even (stone) for a pinnah (cornerstone) , nor an even (stone) for mosadot (foundations) ; but thou shalt be desolate forever, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,51,27,"Lift ye up a nes (banner) in ha'aretz, blow the shofar among the Goyim, prepare the Goyim against her, call together against her the mamlechot of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz; appoint a commander against her; cause the sus to come up like the swarming locusts."
Yirmeyah,51,28,"Prepare against her the Goyim with the melachim (kings) of the Medes, the pachot (rulers) thereof, and all the seganim (officials) thereof, and all the countries ruled thereof."
Yirmeyah,51,29,"And ha'aretz shall shake and tremble; for every purpose of Hashem shall be performed against Bavel, to make eretz Bavel a desolation without an inhabitant."
Yirmeyah,51,30,"The Gibborim of Bavel have ceased to fight, they have remained in their metzadot (strongholds) ; their gevurah (might) hath failed; they became as nashim; they have burned her mishkenot (dwelling places) ; her bars are broken."
Yirmeyah,51,31,"One runner shall run to meet another, and one maggid (messenger) to meet another maggid, to show Melech Bavel that his city is captured on all sides,"
Yirmeyah,51,32,"And that the ma'abarot (fords, river-crossings) have been seized, and the marshes burned with eish, and the anshei hamilchamah are terrified."
Yirmeyah,51,33,"For thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Bat Bavel is like a goren (threshing floor) , when it is time to trample her; yet a little while, and the time of her katzir shall come."
Yirmeyah,51,34,"Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like Tannin (Monster) , he hath filled his belly with delicacies of me, he hath vomited me out."
Yirmeyah,51,35,"The chamas done to me and to my flesh be upon Bavel, shall the inhabitant of Tziyon say; my dahm upon the inhabitants of Kasdim, shall Yerushalayim say."
Yirmeyah,51,36,"Therefore thus saith Hashem ; Hineni, I will defend thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her yam, and make her makor (spring) dry."
Yirmeyah,51,37,"And Bavel shall become heaps of ruin, a ma'on for jackals, a horror to behold, astonishment, and a hissing, without an inhabitant."
Yirmeyah,51,38,They shall roar together like lions; they shall growl as cubs of arayot (lions).
Yirmeyah,51,39,"In their excitement I will prepare their mishtim (feasts) , and I will make them shikkor, that they may rejoice, and sleep shenat olam (a perpetual sleep) , and never awake, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,51,40,"I will bring them down like lambs litvo'ach (to the slaughter), like rams with male goats."
Yirmeyah,51,41,How is Sheshach taken! And how is the tehillat kol ha'aretz seized! How is Bavel become a horror to behold among the Goyim!
Yirmeyah,51,42,The yam (sea) will arise over Bavel; she is covered with the tumult of the waves thereof.
Yirmeyah,51,43,"Her towns are a horror to behold, a dry land, and an aravah, a land wherein no ish dwelleth, neither doth any ben adam pass thereby."
Yirmeyah,51,44,"And I will punish Bel in Bavel, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath gulped down; and the Goyim shall not stream together any more unto him; indeed, the chomat Bavel shall fall."
Yirmeyah,51,45,"My people, come ye out of the midst of her, and save ye every ish his nefesh from the charon af Hashem."
Yirmeyah,51,46,"And lest your lev faint, and ye fear at the rumor that shall be heard in ha'aretz; a rumor shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumor, rumors of chamas in ha'aretz, moshel (ruler) against moshel."
Yirmeyah,51,47,"Therefore, hinei, the days are coming when I will visit [in punishment] the pesalim of Bavel; and her whole land shall be shamed, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her."
Yirmeyah,51,48,"Then the Shomayim and ha'aretz, and all that is therein, shall sing joyously over Bavel; for the plunderers shall come unto her from the tzafon (north) , saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,51,49,Bavel must fall because of the slain of Yisroel as the slain of kol ha'aretz have fallen because of Bavel.
Yirmeyah,51,50,"Ye that have escaped the cherev, leave, stand not still; remember Hashem afar off, and let Yerushalayim come into your heart."
Yirmeyah,51,51,"We are ashamed, because we have heard cherpah; shame hath covered our faces; for zarim are come into the Mikdeshei Beis Hashem."
Yirmeyah,51,52,"Wherefore, hinei, the days are coming, saith Hashem , that I will visit [in punishment] her pesalim (graven images) ; and through all her land the wounded shall groan."
Yirmeyah,51,53,"Though Bavel should ascend to Shomayim, and though she should fortify the height of her stronghold, yet from Me shall plunderers come unto her, saith Hashem."
Yirmeyah,51,54,"A sound of a cry cometh from Bavel, and shever gadol (great destruction) from Eretz Kasdim;"
Yirmeyah,51,55,"Because Hashem hath plundered Bavel, and silenced her kol gadol (great voice) ; when her waves do roar like mayim rabbim, the sound of her roaring resounds;"
Yirmeyah,51,56,"Because the plunderer is come upon her, even upon Bavel, and her gibborim are taken, every one of their keshatot (bows) is broken; for El Gemulot Hashem( Hashem the G-d of Recompense) shall surely repay."
Yirmeyah,51,57,"And I will make shikkor (drunk) her sarim, and her chachamim, her pachot (rulers) , and her seganim (officials) , and her gibborim; and they shall sleep a shenat olam (perpetual sleep) , and never awake, saith HaMelech Hashem Tzva'os Shmo."
Yirmeyah,51,58,"Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: The thick chomot Bavel shall be utterly broken, and her high she'arim shall be burned with eish; and the people shall labor in vain, and the peoples wear themselves out only for eish."
Yirmeyah,51,59,"The Davar which Yirmeyah HaNavi commanded Serayah Ben Neriyah Ben Machseiyah, when he went with Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah into Bavel in the fourth year of his reign. And this Serayah was sar menuchah (quartermaster)."
Yirmeyah,51,60,"So Yirmeyah wrote in a sefer all the ra'ah that should come upon Bavel, even all these devarim that are written against Bavel."
Yirmeyah,51,61,"And Yirmeyah said to Serayah, When thou comest to Bavel, and shalt see, and shalt read all these Devarim;"
Yirmeyah,51,62,"Then shalt thou say, Hashem , Thou hast spoken against this makom, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither adam nor behemah, but that it shall be desolate forever."
Yirmeyah,51,63,"And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this sefer, that thou shalt bind an even (stone) to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates;"
Yirmeyah,51,64,"And thou shalt say, Thus shall Bavel sink, and shall rise no more because of the ra'ah that I will bring upon her. Thus far are the Devarim of Yirmeyah."
Yirmeyah,52,1,"Tzidkiyah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven shanah in Yerushalayim. And shem immo was Chamutal bat Yirmeyah of Livnah."
Yirmeyah,52,2,"And he did that which was rah in the eyes of Hashem , according to all that Y'hoyakim had done."
Yirmeyah,52,3,"For because of the anger of Hashem it came to pass in Yerushalayim and Yehudah, that he finally cast them out from his presence. Tzidkiyah rebelled against HaMelech Bavel."
Yirmeyah,52,4,"And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel came, he and all his army, against Yerushalayim, and encamped against it, and built siegeworks against it round about."
Yirmeyah,52,5,So HaIr went under siege unto the eleventh year of Melech Tzidkiyah.
Yirmeyah,52,6,"And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the ra'av (famine) was severe in the Ir, so that there was no lechem for the Am HaAretz."
Yirmeyah,52,7,"Then the Ir was broken through, and all the anshei hamilchamah fled, and went forth out of the Ir by lailah by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was near the Gan HaMelech; (now the Kasdim were surrounding the Ir); and they fled by the derech HaAravah."
Yirmeyah,52,8,"But the army of the Kasdim (Chaldeans) pursued after HaMelech, and overtook Tzidkiyah in the plains of Yericho; and all his army was separated from him and scattered."
Yirmeyah,52,9,"Then they captured HaMelech, and carried him up unto Melech Bavel to Rivlah in Eretz Chamat; where he pronounced mishpatim upon him."
Yirmeyah,52,10,And Melech Bavel slaughtered the Bnei Tzidkiyah before his eyes; he slaughtered also all the sarim (princes) of Yehudah in Rivlah.
Yirmeyah,52,11,"Then he put out the eyes of Tzidkiyah; and Melech Bavel bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in the bais hapekudot (prison house) till the yom moto (day of his death)."
Yirmeyah,52,12,"Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel, came to Yerushalayim Nevuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served Melech Bavel,"
Yirmeyah,52,13,"And set fire to the Beis Hashem , and the Bais HaMelech (the palace) ; and all the batim (houses) of Yerushalayim, and all the bais hagadol, he burned with eish:"
Yirmeyah,52,14,"And all the army of the Kasdim (Chaldeans) , that were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the chomot (walls) around Yerushalayim."
Yirmeyah,52,15,"Then Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard sent into the Golus certain of the poor of the people, and the remaining of the people that were left in the Ir, and the defectors to Melech Bavel, and the rest of the craftsmen."
Yirmeyah,52,16,But Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for koremim and for farmers.
Yirmeyah,52,17,"Also the Ammudei HaNechoshet that were in the Beis Hashem , and the moveable Stands, and the Yam Hanechoshet that was in the Beis Hashem , the Kasdim (Chaldeans) broke, and carried all the bronze of them to Babylon."
Yirmeyah,52,18,"The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the pans, and all the klei hanechoshet wherewith they ministered, they took away."
Yirmeyah,52,19,"And the cups, and the firepans [for incense], and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the menorahs, and the pans, and the bowls; that which were made of zahav, and that which made of kesef, the captain of the guard carried away."
Yirmeyah,52,20,"The two Ammudim, one Yam, and twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which HaMelech Sh'lomo had made in the Beis Hashem : the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight."
Yirmeyah,52,21,"And concerning the Ammudim, the height of one ammud was eighteen cubits; and twelve cubits in circumference; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow."
Yirmeyah,52,22,"And a capital of nechoshet was upon it; and the height of one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capitals round about, all of nechoshet. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were similar unto these."
Yirmeyah,52,23,And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the surrounding network were a me'ah (hundred).
Yirmeyah,52,24,"And the captain of the guard took Serayah the Kohen HaRosh, and Tzephanyah the second kohen, and the three keepers of the door:"
Yirmeyah,52,25,"He took also out of the Ir the officer, which had the charge of the anshei hamilchamah; and seven men of them that were royal advisers which were found in the Ir; and the Sofer who was the chief officer in charge of conscripting the Am HaAretz; and threescore men of the Am HaAretz, that were found in the midst of the Ir."
Yirmeyah,52,26,"So Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to Melech Bavel to Rivlah."
Yirmeyah,52,27,"And Melech Bavel struck them, and put them to death in Rivlah in Eretz Chamat. Thus Yehudah was carried away captive out of his own land."
Yirmeyah,52,28,"This is the people whom Nevukhadretzar carried away captive: in the seventh year 3,023 Yehudim:"
Yirmeyah,52,29,In the eighteenth year of Nevukhadretzar he carried away captive from Yerushalayim 832 nefesh:
Yirmeyah,52,30,"In the three and twentieth year of Nevukhadretzar Nevuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Yehudim 745 nefesh: the nefesh were 4,600 in all."
Yirmeyah,52,31,"And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the Golus of Y'hoyakhin Melech Yehudah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Eveel-Merodach Melech Bavel in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Y'hoyakhin Melech Yehudah, and brought him forth out of prison."
Yirmeyah,52,32,"And spoke kindly unto him, and set his throne above the kisse of the melachim that were with him in Babylon,"
Yirmeyah,52,33,And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat lechem before him all the days of his life.
Yirmeyah,52,34,"And for his allowance, there was a regular allowance given him of the Melech Bavel, every day a portion until the yom moto all the days of his life."
