Devarim,1,1,"These are the devarim (words) which Moshe spoke unto kol Yisroel on the far side of the Yarden in the midbar, in the Aravah opposite Suf between Paran, and Tophel, and Lavan, and Chatzerot, and Di-Zahav."
Devarim,1,2,(There is eleven daysʼ journey from Chorev unto Kadesh-Barnea by way of Mount Se'ir.)
Devarim,1,3,"And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moshe spoke unto the Bnei Yisroel, according unto all that Hashem had given him in commandment unto them,"
Devarim,1,4,"After he had slain Sichon Melech HaEmori, which dwelt in Cheshbon, and Og Melech HaBashan, which dwelt in Ashtarot at Edre'i;"
Devarim,1,5,"On the far side of the Yarden, in Eretz Moav, began Moshe to expound this torah, saying,"
Devarim,1,6," Hashem Eloheinu spoke unto us in Chorev, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough at this mountain;"
Devarim,1,7,"Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the Har HaEmori (hill country of the Amorites) , and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the Aravah, in the hills, in the Shefelah, and in the Negev, and by the seacoast, to the Eretz HaKena'ani (Land of the Canaanites) , and unto Levanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates."
Devarim,1,8,"See, I have set ha'aretz (the land) before you; go in and possess ha'aretz which Hashem swore unto Avoteichem, Avraham, Yitzchak, and Ya'akov, to give unto them and to their zera after them."
Devarim,1,9,"And I spoke unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear the burden of you by myself alone;"
Devarim,1,10," Hashem Eloheichem hath multiplied you, and, see, ye are today as numerous as the kokhavei HaShomayim."
Devarim,1,11,"( Hashem Elohei Avoteichem increase you a thousand times over and bless you, as He hath promised you!)"
Devarim,1,12,"How can I myself alone bear your problems, and your massa and your strife?"
Devarim,1,13,"Take you anashim chachamim, men of wisdom and understanding, who are known among your tribes, and I will set them over you."
Devarim,1,14,"And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is tov for us to do."
Devarim,1,15,"So I took the leaders of your tribes, anashim chachamim, men of understanding, and made them heads over you, over thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens, shoterim among your tribes."
Devarim,1,16,"And I charged your shofetim at that time, saying, Hear the cases between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the ger that is with him."
Devarim,1,17,"Ye shall not respect persons in mishpat but ye shall hear the katon as well as the gadol; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the mishpat is Elohimʼs: and the case that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it."
Devarim,1,18,And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
Devarim,1,19,"And when we departed from Chorev, we went through all that great and terrible midbar, which ye saw on the way to the Har HaEmori, just as Hashem Eloheinu commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-Barnea."
Devarim,1,20,"And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the Har HaEmori which Hashem Eloheinu doth give unto us."
Devarim,1,21,"See, Hashem Eloheicha hath set ha'aretz before thee; go up and possess it, as Hashem Elohei Avoteicha hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged."
Devarim,1,22,"And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, Let us send anashim ahead of us, and they shall spy out ha'aretz, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what towns we shall come."
Devarim,1,23,"And the proposal pleased me well; and I took Shneym Asar, (Twelve) of you, one of each shevet (tribe);"
Devarim,1,24,"And they turned and went up into the hill country, and came unto the Eshcol Valley, and explored it."
Devarim,1,25,"And they took of the pri ha'aretz in their hands, brought it down unto us, brought us word, and said, It is a tovah ha'aretz which Hashem Eloheinu doth give us."
Devarim,1,26,"Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Hashem Eloheichem;"
Devarim,1,27,"And ye murmured in your oholim, and said, Because Hashem hated us, He hath brought us forth out of Eretz Mitzrayim, to deliver us into the hand of HaEmori, to destroy us."
Devarim,1,28,"Where shall we go up? Our brethren have discouraged levavenu (our hearts) , saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to Shomayim; moreover we have seen the Bnei Anakim there."
Devarim,1,29,"Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them."
Devarim,1,30," Hashem Eloheichem which goeth before you, He shall fight for you, according to all that He did for you in Mitzrayim before your eyes;"
Devarim,1,31,"And in the midbar, where thou hast seen how that Hashem Eloheicha did bear thee, as a man doth carry his ben, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place."
Devarim,1,32,"Yet in this thing ye were not ma'aminim (believers) in Hashem Eloheichem,"
Devarim,1,33,"Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in eish by lailah, to show you by what way ye should go, and in an anan (cloud) by day."
Devarim,1,34,"And Hashem heard the sound of your words, and was angry, and on oath, said,"
Devarim,1,35,"Surely there shall not one of these men of this dor harah see ha'aretz hatovah, which I swore to give unto Avoteichem."
Devarim,1,36,"Except Kalev ben Yephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give ha'aretz that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed Hashem."
Devarim,1,37,"Also Hashem was angry with me because of you, saying, Thou also shalt not go in there."
Devarim,1,38,"But Yehoshua ben Nun, the one assisting thee, he shall go in there; encourage him, for he shall cause Yisroel to inherit it."
Devarim,1,39,"Moreover your little ones, which ye said would be taken captive, and your children, which as yet do not have knowledge between tov and rah, they shall go in there, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it."
Devarim,1,40,"But as for you, turn, take your journey into the midbar by the way of the Yam Suf."
Devarim,1,41,"Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against Hashem ; we will go up and fight, according to all that Hashem Eloheinu did command us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye made light of going up into the hill country."
Devarim,1,42,"And Hashem said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not in your midst; lest ye be struck down before your enemies."
Devarim,1,43,"So I spoke unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of Hashem , and went presumptuously up into the hill country."
Devarim,1,44,"And HaEmori, which dwelt in that hill country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Se'ir, even unto Chormah."
Devarim,1,45,"And ye returned and wept before Hashem ; but Hashem would not listen to your voice, nor give ear unto you."
Devarim,1,46,That is why ye abode in Kadesh as long as ye did.
Devarim,2,1,"Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Yam Suf, as Hashem spoke unto me; and we circled Mt Se'ir yamim rabbim (many days)."
Devarim,2,2,"And Hashem spoke unto me, saying,"
Devarim,2,3,Ye have circled hahar hazeh (this mountain) long enough; turn you northward.
Devarim,2,4,"And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the territory of your brethren the Bnei Esav, which dwell in Se'ir; and they shall be afraid of you; be shomer me'od of yourselves therefore:"
Devarim,2,5,"Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a regel (foot) breadth; because I have given Mt Se'ir unto Esav for a yerushah (possession, inheritance)."
Devarim,2,6,"Ye shall get by trade okhel (food) of them for kesef, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy mayim of them for kesef, that ye may drink."
Devarim,2,7,For Hashem Eloheicha hath bestowed a brocha on thee in all the works of thy hand; He knoweth thy walking through this midbar hagadol (great wilderness) ; these arba'im shanim Hashem Eloheicha hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.
Devarim,2,8,"And when we went on past our brethren the Bnei Esav, who dwell in Se'ir, through the road of the Aravah from Eilat, and from Etzyon-Gever, we turned and passed by on the road through the midbar of Moav."
Devarim,2,9,"And Hashem said unto me, Harass not the Moavim, neither provoke them to milchamah for I will not give thee of their land for a yerushah; because I have given Ar unto the Bnei Lot for a yerushah."
Devarim,2,10,"The Emim dwelt therein in times past, a people great, many, and tall, as the Anakim;"
Devarim,2,11,"Which also were accounted Repha'im, as the Anakim; but the Moavim called them Emim."
Devarim,2,12,"The Chorim also dwelt in Se'ir beforetime; but the Bnei Esav succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their place; as Yisroel did unto the eretz of his yerushah Hashem gave unto them."
Devarim,2,13,"Now rise up, and get you over the Wadi Zered. And we went over the Wadi Zered."
Devarim,2,14,"And the space in which we came from Kadesh-Barnea, until we were come over the Wadi Zered, was 38 shanim; until all the generation of the anshei hamilchamah had been consumed from the machaneh, as Hashem had sworn unto them."
Devarim,2,15,"For indeed the yad Hashem was against them, to destroy them from among the machaneh, until they were consumed."
Devarim,2,16,"So it came to pass, when kol anshei hamilchamah were consumed and dead from among HaAm (the People),"
Devarim,2,17,"That Hashem spoke unto me, saying,"
Devarim,2,18,Thou art to pass over the border of Moav at Ar today;
Devarim,2,19,"And when thou comest opposite the Bnei Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them; for I will not give thee of the Eretz Bnei Ammon any yerushah; because I have given it unto the Bnei Lot for a yerushah."
Devarim,2,20,(That also was accounted a land of Repha'im; Repha'im dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonim call them Zamzummim;
Devarim,2,21,"A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Hashem destroyed them before them; and they dispossessed them, and dwelt in their place:"
Devarim,2,22,"As He did to the Bnei Esav, which dwelt in Se'ir, when He destroyed the Chori from before them; and they succeeded them, dwelling in their place even to this day;"
Devarim,2,23,"And the Avim which dwelt in villages, even unto Azah, the Caphtorim, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their place.)"
Devarim,2,24,"Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the Wadi Arnon: see, I have given into thine hand the Emori, Sichon Melech Cheshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in milchamah (battle, war)."
Devarim,2,25,"Hayom hazeh will I begin to put the pachad (dread) of thee and the fear of thee upon the ammim (peoples) that are under Kol HaShomayim, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee."
Devarim,2,26,"And I sent malachim out of the midbar Kedemot unto Sichon Melech Cheshbon with divrei shalom, saying,"
Devarim,2,27,Let me pass through thy land on the derech; I will go along on the derech; I will neither turn unto the yamin nor to the semol (left).
Devarim,2,28,"Thou shalt sell me okhel for kesef, that I may eat; and give me mayim for kesef, that I may drink; only I will pass through on foot;"
Devarim,2,29," (As the Bnei Esav which dwell in Se'ir, and the Moavim which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Yarden into the land which Hashem Eloheinu giveth us."
Devarim,2,30,"But Sichon Melech Cheshbon would not let us pass by him; for Hashem Eloheicha hardened and made stubborn his ruach, and made his lev obstinate, that He might deliver him into thy hand, as indeed hayom hazeh."
Devarim,2,31,"And Hashem said unto me, See, I have begun to give Sichon and his land before thee; begin the occupation, that thou mayest take possession to inherit his land."
Devarim,2,32,"Then Sichon came out against us, he and all his people, to make milchamah (battle, war) at Yahatz."
Devarim,2,33,"And Hashem Eloheinu delivered him before us; and we struck him, and his banim, and all his people."
Devarim,2,34,"And we took all his towns at that time, and in cherem utterly destroyed them, and of the nashim, and the little ones, of every town, we left no remnant;"
Devarim,2,35,"Only the behemah we took for booty unto ourselves, and the plunder of the towns which we took."
Devarim,2,36,"From Aro'er, which is on the edge of Wadi Arnon, and from the town that is by the wadi, even unto Gil'ad, there was not one town too strong for us; Hashem Eloheinu delivered all unto us:"
Devarim,2,37,"Only unto the Eretz Bnei Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the Wadi Yabbok, nor unto the towns in the hills, in accordance with the command of Hashem Eloheinu."
Devarim,3,1,"Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan; and Og Melech HaBashan came out against us, he and all his people, to engage in milchamah at Edre'i."
Devarim,3,2,"And Hashem said unto me, Fear him not; for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sichon Melech HaEmori which dwelt at Cheshbon."
Devarim,3,3,"So Hashem Eloheinu delivered into our hands also Og Melech HaBashan, and all his people; and we struck him until no remnant was left to him."
Devarim,3,4,"And we took all his towns at that time; there was not a kiryah (town, city) which we took not from them, threescore towns, all the region of Argov, the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Devarim,3,5,"All these towns were walled with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns harbeh me'od (very many)."
Devarim,3,6,"And in cherem we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sichon Melech Cheshbon, in cherem utterly destroying the men, nashim, and little ones, of every town."
Devarim,3,7,"But all the behemah (livestock) , and the plunder of the towns, we took for booty to ourselves."
Devarim,3,8,"And we took at that time out of the hand of the two melachim of the Emori the land that was on this side of Yarden, from the Wadi Arnon unto Mt Chermon;"
Devarim,3,9, (Which Chermon the Tzidonim call Siryon; and the Emori call it Senir;)
Devarim,3,10,"All the towns of the plain, and all Gil'ad, and all Bashan, unto Salkhah and Edre'i, towns of the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Devarim,3,11,"For only Og Melech HaBashan remained of the remnant of Repha'im; hinei, his bedstead was a bedstead of barzel. Is it not in Rabbah of the Bnei Ammon? Nine regular cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it."
Devarim,3,12,"And ha'aretz hazot, which we possessed at that time, from Aro'er, which is by the Wadi Arnon, and half way up the hill country of Gil'ad, and the towns thereof, gave I unto the Reuveni and Gadi."
Devarim,3,13,"And the rest of Gil'ad, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Menasheh; all the region of Argov, with all Bashan, which was called Eretz Repha'im."
Devarim,3,14,"Yair ben Menasheh took all the region of Argov unto the border of Geshuri and Ma'akhati, and called them after shmo (his own name) , HaBashan Havot Yair, unto hayom hazeh."
Devarim,3,15,And I gave Gil'ad unto Machir.
Devarim,3,16,"And unto the Reuveni and unto the Gadi I gave from Gil'ad even unto the Wadi Arnon with the middle of the valley as the border even unto the Wadi Yabbok, which is the border of the Bnei Ammon;"
Devarim,3,17,"The Aravah also, and Yarden, and the coast thereof, from Kinneret even unto the yam of the Aravah, even the Yam HaMelach (the Salt Sea, the Dead Sea) , under the slopes of Pisgah to the east."
Devarim,3,18,"And I commanded you at that time, saying, Hashem Eloheichem hath given you this land to possess it; ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the Bnei Yisroel, all bnei chayil (valiant men, men fit for military service)."
Devarim,3,19,"But your nashim, and your little ones, and your livestock (for I know that ye have much livestock,) shall abide in your towns which I have given you;"
Devarim,3,20,"Until Hashem have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess ha'aretz which Hashem Eloheichem hath given them beyond Yarden; and then shall ye return every man unto his yerushah (possession, inheritance) , which I have given you."
Devarim,3,21,"And I commanded Yehoshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that Hashem Eloheichem hath done unto these two melachim; so shall Hashem do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest."
Devarim,3,22,Ye shall not fear them; for Hashem Eloheichem He shall fight for you.
Devarim,3,23,"And I besought Hashem at that time, saying,"
Devarim,3,24,"O Adonoi Hashem , Thou hast begun to show Thy eved Thy greatness, and Thy mighty hand; for what El (G-d) is there in Shomayim or on Ha'Aretz, that can do according to Thy works, and according to Thy might?"
Devarim,3,25,"Ah, let me go over, and see ha'aretz hatovah that is beyond Yarden, that fine hill country, and the Levanon."
Devarim,3,26,"But Hashem was angry with me for your sakes, and would not hear me; and Hashem said unto me, Enough from thee; speak no more unto Me of this matter."
Devarim,3,27,"Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see it with thine eyes; for thou shalt not go over this Yarden."
Devarim,3,28,"But commission Yehoshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit ha'aretz which thou shalt see."
Devarim,3,29,So we abode in the valley over against Beit-Pe'or.
Devarim,4,1,"Now therefore shema, Yisroel, unto the chukkim and unto the mishpatim, which I melammed (teach) you, to do them, in order that ye may live, and go in and possess ha'aretz which Hashem Elohei Avoteichem giveth you."
Devarim,4,2,"Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye take anything from it, that ye may be shomer mitzvot of the commandments of Hashem Eloheichem which I command you."
Devarim,4,3,"Your eyes have seen what Hashem did because of Ba'al-Pe'or; for all the men that followed Ba'al-Pe'or, Hashem Eloheicha hath destroyed them from among you."
Devarim,4,4,But ye that did have deveykus (cleaving) unto Hashem Eloheichem are alive every one of you today.
Devarim,4,5,"Behold, I have taught you chukkim and mishpatim, even as Hashem Elohai commanded me, that ye should do so in ha'aretz whither ye go to possess it."
Devarim,4,6,"Be shomer therefore and do them; for this is your chochmah and your binah in the sight of the peoples, which shall hear all these chukkim, and say, Surely HaGoy HaGadol is a wise and understanding people."
Devarim,4,7,"For what nation is there so great, who hath elohim so near unto them, as Hashem Eloheinu is in all things for which we call upon Him?"
Devarim,4,8,"And what nation is there so great, that hath chukkim and mishpatim tzaddikim as all this torah, which I set before you today?"
Devarim,4,9,"Only be shomer over thyself, and be shomer over thy nefesh diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy lev kol yamim of thy life; but teach them to thy banim, and the banim of thy banim;"
Devarim,4,10,"Specially the yom that thou stoodest before Hashem Eloheicha in Chorev, when Hashem said unto me, Gather Me the people together, and I will make them hear My words, that they may learn to fear Me kol hayamim that they shall live upon ha'adamah and that they may teach their children."
Devarim,4,11,"And ye came near and stood at the foot of the mountain; the mountain burned with eish unto the midst of Shomayim, with choshech, and anan, and thick darkness."
Devarim,4,12,"And Hashem spoke unto you out of the midst of the eish; ye heard the voice of the devarim, but saw no temunah (form, semblance) ; only ye heard a voice."
Devarim,4,13,"And He declared unto you His Brit, which He commanded you to do, even Aseres HaDevarim; and He wrote them upon shnei luchot avanim (two tablets of stone)."
Devarim,4,14,"And Hashem commanded me at that time to teach you chukkim and mishpatim, that ye might do them in ha'aretz whither ye go over to possess it."
Devarim,4,15,"Be shomer over yourselves, therefore; for ye saw no manner of temunah on the yom that Hashem spoke unto you in Chorev out of the midst of the eish;"
Devarim,4,16,"Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a pesel, the temunah of any semel, the likeness of zachar or nekevah,"
Devarim,4,17,"The likeness of any behemah that is on ha'aretz, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,"
Devarim,4,18,"The likeness of anything that creepeth on the adamah, the likeness of any dag (fish) that is in the waters below;"
Devarim,4,19,"And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto Shomayim, and when thou seest the shemesh, and the yarei'ach, and the kokhavim, even all the tz'va HaShomayim, shouldest be driven to hishtachaveh (bow down, worship) them, and serve them which Hashem Eloheicha hath divided unto kol Amim under kol HaShomayim."
Devarim,4,20,"But Hashem hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Mitzrayim, to be unto Him an Am Nachalah (a people of inheritance) , as ye are yom hazeh."
Devarim,4,21,"Furthermore Hashem was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over Yarden, and that I should not go in unto that ha'aretz hatovah, which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee for a nachalah (inheritance);"
Devarim,4,22,"But I must die in this land, I must not go over Yarden; but ye shall go over, and possess that ha'aretz hatovah."
Devarim,4,23,"Be shomer over yourselves, lest ye forget the Brit Hashem Eloheichem, which He cut with you, and make you a pesel (idol, image) , or the likeness of anything, which Hashem Eloheicha hath forbidden thee."
Devarim,4,24,"For Hashem Eloheicha is a consuming eish, even an El Kannah."
Devarim,4,25,"When thou shalt father banim, and bnei banim, and ye shall have remained long in Ha'Aretz, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a pesel, or the likeness of anything, and shall do evil in the sight of Hashem Eloheicha, to provoke Him to anger;"
Devarim,4,26,"I call Shomayim and HaAretz to witness against you today, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off Ha'Aretz whereunto ye go over Yarden to possess it; ye shall not prolong your yamim upon it, but shall be utterly shmad."
Devarim,4,27,"And Hashem shall scatter you among the amim; ye shall be left few in number among the Goyim, whither Hashem shall lead you."
Devarim,4,28,"And there ye shall serve elohim, the work of menʼs hands, etz (wood) and even (stone) , which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell."
Devarim,4,29,"But if from thence thou shalt seek Hashem Eloheicha, thou shalt find Him, if thou seek Him with all thy lev and with all thy nefesh."
Devarim,4,30,"When thou art in tzar (tribulation) , and all these things are come upon thee, even in the acharit hayamim, if thou turn to Hashem Eloheicha and shalt be obedient unto His voice;"
Devarim,4,31,"For Hashem Eloheicha is an El Rachum; He will not abandon thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the Brit Avoteicha which He swore unto them."
Devarim,4,32,"For ask now of the yamim that are past, which were before thee, since the yom that Elohim bara man upon Ha'Aretz, and ask from the one side of Shomayim unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?"
Devarim,4,33,"Did ever people hear the kol Elohim speaking out of the midst of the eish, as thou hast heard, and live?"
Devarim,4,34,"Or hath Elohim tried to go and take Him a nation from the midst of another nation, by massot (trials) , by otot, by mofetim, by milchamah, by a yad chazakah, by an outstretched zero'a, by great terrors, according to all that Hashem Eloheicha did for you in Mitzrayim before your eyes?"
Devarim,4,35,"Unto thee it was showed, that thou mightest know that Hashem He is HaElohim; there is none else beside Him."
Devarim,4,36,"Out of Shomayim He made thee to hear His voice, that He might discipline thee; upon Ha'Aretz He showed thee His eish hagedolah; and thou heardest His devarim out of the midst of the eish."
Devarim,4,37,"And because He loved Avoteicha, therefore He chose their zera after them, and brought thee out in His sight with His ko'ach hagadol out of Mitzrayim;"
Devarim,4,38,"To drive out Goyim from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for a nachalah, as it is yom hazeh."
Devarim,4,39,"Know therefore today, and consider it in thine lev, that Hashem He is HaElohim in Shomayim above, and upon Ha'Aretz beneath: there is no other."
Devarim,4,40,"Thou shalt be shomer over His chukkim, therefore, and His mitzvot, which I command thee today, that it may go well with thee, and with thy banim after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy yamim upon adamah, which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee, kol hayamim."
Devarim,4,41,Then Moshe separated and set apart three towns on this side of the Yarden toward the rising of the shemesh;
Devarim,4,42,"That the rotze'ach might flee thither, which should kill his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these towns he might live:"
Devarim,4,43,"Namely, Betzer in the midbar, in the flatland, of the Reuveni; and Ramot in Gil'ad, of the Gadi; and Golan in Bashan, of the Menashi."
Devarim,4,44,And this is the torah which Moshe set before the Bnei Yisroel;
Devarim,4,45,"These are the edot, and the chukkim, and the mishpatim, which Moshe spoke unto the Bnei Yisroel, after they came forth out of Mitzrayim."
Devarim,4,46,"On this side of the Yarden, in the valley over against Beit-Pe'or, in Eretz Sichon Melech HaEmori, who dwelt at Cheshbon, whom Moshe and the Bnei Yisroel struck down, after they were come forth out of Mitzrayim;"
Devarim,4,47,"And they possessed his land, and Eretz Og Melech HaBashan, two melachim of HaEmori, which were on this side of the Yarden toward the rising of the shemesh;"
Devarim,4,48,"From Aro'er, which is by the edge of the Wadi Arnon, even unto Mt Siyon, which is Chermon,"
Devarim,4,49,"And all the Aravah on this side of the Yarden eastward, even unto the Dead Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah."
Devarim,5,1,"And Moshe called kol Yisroel, and said unto them, Shema, Yisroel, to the chukkim and mishpatim which I speak in your ears today, that ye may learn them, and be shomer to do them."
Devarim,5,2, Hashem Eloheinu made a Brit with us in Chorev.
Devarim,5,3," Hashem made not this Brit with Avoteinu, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive today."
Devarim,5,4," Hashem talked with you panim b'panim in the har out of the midst of the eish,"
Devarim,5,5,"(I stood between Hashem and you at that time, to show you the Devar Hashem ; for ye were afraid by reason of the eish, and went not up into the har) saying:"
Devarim,5,6," [ALEF] I am Hashem Eloheicha, Which brought thee out of Eretz Mitzrayim, from the bais avadim."
Devarim,5,7, [BET] Thou shalt have no elohim acharim before Me.
Devarim,5,8,"Thou shalt not make thee any pesel, or any temunah of anything that is in Shomayim above, or that is in Ha'Aretz beneath, or that is in the mayim beneath ha'aretz;"
Devarim,5,9,"Lo tishtachaveh (thou shalt not bow down thyself) unto them, nor serve them; for I Hashem Eloheicha am an El Kannah, visiting the iniquity of the avot upon the banim unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me,"
Devarim,5,10,And showing chesed unto thousands of them that love Me and are shomer over My mitzvot.
Devarim,5,11, [GIMEL] Thou shalt not take the Shem of Hashem Eloheicha in vain; for Hashem will not hold him guiltless that taketh Shmo in vain.
Devarim,5,12, [DALET] Keep shomer Shabbos to set Shabbos apart as kodesh as Hashem Eloheicha commanded thee.
Devarim,5,13,"Sheshet yamim thou shalt labor, and do all thy work:"
Devarim,5,14,"But the Yom HaShevi'i is the Shabbos of Hashem Eloheicha: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy ben, nor thy bat, nor thy eved, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine donkey, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy ger that is within thy she'arim; that thy eved and thy amah may rest as well as thou."
Devarim,5,15,"And remember that thou wast an eved in Eretz Mitzrayim, and that Hashem Eloheicha brought thee out thence through a yad chazakah and by an outstretched zero'a; therefore Hashem Eloheicha commanded thee to be shomer Shabbos on Yom HaShabbat."
Devarim,5,16," [HEH] Honor thy av and thy em, as Hashem Eloheicha hath commanded thee; that thy yamim may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in ha'adamah which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee."
Devarim,5,17, [VAV] Lo tirtzah (thou shalt not murder).
Devarim,5,18, [ZAYIN] V'lo tinaf (neither shalt thou commit adultery).
Devarim,5,19, [KHET] V'lo tignov (neither shalt thou steal).
Devarim,5,20, [TET] V'lo ta'aneh v'reacha ed shav (neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor).
Devarim,5,21," [YOD] V'lo tachmod (neither shalt thou covet, desiring) thy neighborʼs wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighborʼs bais, his sadeh, or his eved, or his amah, his ox, or his donkey, or any thing that is thy neighborʼs."
Devarim,5,22,"These devarim Hashem spoke unto all your Kahal in the mountain out of the midst of the eish, of the anan, and of the thick darkness, with a kol gadol; and He added no more. And He wrote them in two luchot of even (stone) , and delivered them unto me."
Devarim,5,23,"And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the choshech, (for the har did burn with eish,) that ye came near unto me, even all your Rashei Shvatim (Heads of Tribes) , and your Zekenim (Elders);"
Devarim,5,24,"And ye said, Behold, Hashem Eloheinu hath showed us His kavod and His gadol (greatness) , and we have heard His voice out of the midst of the eish; we have seen today that Elohim doth talk with man, and he liveth."
Devarim,5,25,"Now therefore why should we die? For this great eish will consume us; if we hear the voice of Hashem Eloheinu any more, then we shall die."
Devarim,5,26,"For who is there of all basar, that hath heard the voice of the Elohim Chayyim speaking out of the midst of the eish, as we have, and lived?"
Devarim,5,27,"Go thou near, and hear all that Hashem Eloheinu shall say; and speak thou unto us all that Hashem Eloheinu shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it."
Devarim,5,28,"And Hashem heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke unto me; and Hashem said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee; they have well said all that they have spoken."
Devarim,5,29,"O that there were such a lev in them, that they would fear Me, and be shomer mitzvot over all My mitzvot always, that it might be well with them, and with their banim l'olam!"
Devarim,5,30,"Go say to them, Get you into your oholim again."
Devarim,5,31,"But as for thee, stand thou here by Me, and I will speak unto thee all the mitzvot, and the chukkim, and the mishpatim, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in ha'aretz which I give them to possess it."
Devarim,5,32,Ye shall be shomer to do therefore as Hashem Eloheicha hath commanded you; ye shall not turn aside to the right or to the left.
Devarim,5,33,"Ye shall walk in kol HaDerech which Hashem Eloheicha hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your yamim in ha'aretz which ye shall possess."
Devarim,6,1,"Now these are the mitzvot, the chukkim, and the mishpatim, which Hashem Eloheichem commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in ha'aretz whither ye go to possess it:"
Devarim,6,2,"That thou mightest fear Hashem Eloheicha, to be shomer over all His chukkim and His mitzvot, which I command thee, thou, and thy ben, and thy benʼs ben, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged."
Devarim,6,3,"Shema therefore, Yisroel, and be shomer to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as Hashem Elohei Avoteicha hath promised thee, in Eretz Zavat Cholov uDevash."
Devarim,6,4,Shema Yisroel Adonoi ( Hashem ) Eloheinu Adonoi ( Hashem ) Echad.
Devarim,6,5,And thou shalt love Hashem Eloheicha b'chol l'vavcha u'vchol nafshcha uvechol modecha.
Devarim,6,6,"And these devarim, which I command thee today, shall be in thine lev;"
Devarim,6,7,"And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy banim, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine bais, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up."
Devarim,6,8,"And thou shalt bind them for an ot upon thine hand, and they shall be as totafos (ornaments) between thine eyes."
Devarim,6,9,"And thou shalt write them upon the mezuzot of thy bais, and on thy she'arim."
Devarim,6,10,"And it shall be, when Hashem Eloheicha shall have brought thee into ha'aretz He swore unto Avoteicha, to Avraham, to Yitzchak, and to Ya'akov, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not,"
Devarim,6,11,"And batim full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, kramim (vineyards) and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;"
Devarim,6,12,"Then beware lest thou forget Hashem , which brought thee forth out of Eretz Mitzrayim, from the bais avadim."
Devarim,6,13,"Thou shalt fear Hashem Eloheicha, and serve Him, and shalt swear by Shmo."
Devarim,6,14,"Ye shall not go after elohim acherim, of elohei ha'amim (the g-ds of the peoples) which are round about you;"
Devarim,6,15,"(For Hashem Eloheicha is an El Kannah among you) lest the anger of Hashem Eloheicha be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of ha'adamah."
Devarim,6,16,"Ye shall not test Hashem Eloheichem, as ye tested Him in Massah."
Devarim,6,17,"Ye diligently shall be shomer mitzvot over the mitzvot Hashem Eloheichem and His edut, and His chukkim, which He hath commanded thee."
Devarim,6,18,"And thou shalt do that which is yashar (right, straight) and hatov in the eyes of Hashem ; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess ha'aretz hatovah which Hashem swore unto Avoteicha."
Devarim,6,19,"To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as Hashem hath spoken."
Devarim,6,20,"And when thy ben asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the edut, and the chukkim, and the mishpatim which Hashem Eloheinu hath commanded you?"
Devarim,6,21,"Then thou shalt say unto thy ben, We were Pharaohʼs avadim in Mitzrayim; and Hashem brought us out of Mitzrayim with a yad chazakah;"
Devarim,6,22,"And Hashem showed otot and mofetim, great and terrible, upon Mitzrayim, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:"
Devarim,6,23,"And He brought us out from thence, that He might bring us in, to give us ha'aretz which He promised on oath unto Avoteinu."
Devarim,6,24,"And Hashem commanded us to do all these chukkim, to fear Hashem Eloheinu, for our good always, that He might preserve us alive, as it is at yom hazeh."
Devarim,6,25,"And tzedakah it shall be for us, if we are shomer to do all these mitzvot before Hashem Eloheinu, as He hath commanded us."
Devarim,7,1,"When Hashem Eloheicha shall bring thee into ha'aretz whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out Goyim rabbim before thee, the Chitti, and the Girgashi, and the Emori, and the Kena'ani, and the Perizzi, and the Chivi, and the Yevusi, shivah Goyim greater and mightier than thou;"
Devarim,7,2,"And when Hashem Eloheicha shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt strike them down, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no Brit with them, nor show mercy unto them;"
Devarim,7,3,"Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy bat thou shalt not give unto his ben, nor his bat shalt thou take unto thy ben."
Devarim,7,4,"For they will turn away thy ben from following Me, that they may serve elohim acherim; so will the anger of Hashem be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly."
Devarim,7,5,"But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their mizbechot, and break down their matzeivot (pillars) , and cut down their Asherah, and burn their peselim with eish."
Devarim,7,6,"For thou art an Am Kadosh unto Hashem Eloheicha; Hashem Eloheicha hath chosen thee to be an Am Segullah (Treasured People) unto Himself, above all people that are upon the face of ha'adamah."
Devarim,7,7," Hashem did not set His love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of kol ha'amim;"
Devarim,7,8,"But because of Ahavat Hashem (because Hashem loved you), and because He would be shomer over haShevu'ah (the Oath) which He had sworn unto Avoteichem, hath Hashem brought you out with a yad chazakah, and redeemed you out of the bais avadim, from the hand of Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim."
Devarim,7,9,"Know therefore that Hashem Eloheicha, He is HaElohim, the El HaNe'eman, which is shomer HaBrit and hath chesed with them that love Him and are shomer mitzvot to a thousand generations;"
Devarim,7,10,"And repayeth them that are the soneh (hater, enemy) of Him to their face, to destroy them; He will not be slack to him that hateth Him, He will repay him to his face."
Devarim,7,11,"Thou shalt therefore be shomer mitzvot, and keep the chukkim, and the mishpatim, which I command thee today, to do them."
Devarim,7,12,"Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye give heed to these mishpatim, and are shomer, and do them, that Hashem Eloheicha shall be shomer over the Brit unto thee and the chesed which He swore unto Avoteicha;"
Devarim,7,13,"And He will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee; He will also bless the pri of thy womb, and the pri of thy land, thy grain, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy cattle, and the flocks of thy sheep, in adamah which He swore unto Avoteicha to give thee."
Devarim,7,14,"Baruch shalt thou be more than kol ha'amim; there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle."
Devarim,7,15,"And Hashem will take away from thee every choli (disease) , and will put none of the evil diseases of Mitzrayim, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee."
Devarim,7,16,And thou shalt consume kol haAm which Hashem Eloheicha shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them; neither shalt thou serve eloheihem (their g-ds) ; for that will be a snare unto thee.
Devarim,7,17,"If thou shalt say in thine lev, These Goyim are more than I; how can I dispossess them?"
Devarim,7,18,"Thou shalt not be afraid of them; but shalt well remember what Hashem Eloheicha did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Mitzrayim;"
Devarim,7,19,"The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the otot, and the mofetim, and the yad chazakah, and the stretched out zero'a, whereby Hashem Eloheicha brought thee out; so shall Hashem Eloheicha do unto kol ha'amim of whom thou art afraid."
Devarim,7,20,"Moreover Hashem Eloheicha will send the hornet swarm among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed."
Devarim,7,21,"Thou shalt not be afraid of them; for Hashem Eloheicha is among you, an El Gadol v'Norah."
Devarim,7,22,"And Hashem Eloheicha will put out those Goyim before thee m'at m'at (little by little) ; thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the sadeh increase upon thee."
Devarim,7,23,"But Hashem Eloheicha shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be shmad."
Devarim,7,24,"And He shall deliver their melachim into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their shem from under Shomayim; there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them."
Devarim,7,25,"The peselim of eloheihem shall ye burn with eish; thou shalt not desire the kesef or zahav that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; for it is a to'evah (abomination) to Hashem Eloheicha."
Devarim,7,26,"Neither shalt thou bring a to'evah (abomination) into thine bais, lest thou be a cherem like it; but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cherem."
Devarim,8,1,"Kol hamitzvot which I command thee today shall ye be shomer to do, lema'an (in order that) ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess ha'aretz which Hashem swore unto Avoteichem."
Devarim,8,2,"And thou shalt remember kol haderech which Hashem Eloheicha led thee these arba'im shanah in the midbar, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine lev, whether thou wouldest be shomer over His mitzvot, or no."
Devarim,8,3,"And He humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did Avoteicha know; that He might make thee know that man doth not live by lechem only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of Hashem doth man live."
Devarim,8,4,"Thy raiment did not increase old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these arba'im shanah."
Devarim,8,5,"Thou shalt also consider in thine lev, that, as a man chasteneth bno, so Hashem Eloheicha chasteneth thee."
Devarim,8,6,"Therefore thou shalt be shomer over the mitzvot of Hashem Eloheicha, to walk in His ways, and to fear Him."
Devarim,8,7,"For Hashem Eloheicha bringeth thee into an eretz tovah, a land of brooks of mayim, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;"
Devarim,8,8,"An eretz chittah, and se'orah (barley) , and gefen, and te'enah, and pomegranates; an eretz zayit shemen, and devash;"
Devarim,8,9,"An eretz wherein thou shalt eat lechem without scarceness, thou shalt not lack anything in it; an eretz whose stones are barzel, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig nechoshet (bronze)."
Devarim,8,10,"When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless Hashem Eloheicha for ha'aretz hatovah which He hath given thee."
Devarim,8,11,"Beware that thou forget not Hashem Eloheicha, in not being shomer over His mitzvot, and His mishpatim, and His chukkot, which I command thee today;"
Devarim,8,12,"Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly batim (houses) and dwelt therein;"
Devarim,8,13,"And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy kesef and thy zahav is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;"
Devarim,8,14,"Then thine lev be lifted up, and thou forget Hashem Eloheicha which brought thee forth out of Eretz Mitzrayim, from the bais avadim;"
Devarim,8,15,"Who led thee through that great and terrible midbar, wherein were fiery nachash, and akrav (scorpions) , and parched earth, where there was no mayim; Who brought thee forth mayim out of the rock of flint;"
Devarim,8,16,"Who fed thee in the midbar with manna, which Avoteicha knew not, that He might humble thee, and that He might prove thee, to do thee good at thy acharit;"
Devarim,8,17,"And thou say in thine lev, My ko'ach (power) and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this chayil (wealth)."
Devarim,8,18,"But thou shalt remember Hashem Eloheicha; for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth, that He may establish His Brit which He swore unto Avoteicha, as it is yom hazeh."
Devarim,8,19,"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget Hashem Eloheicha, and walk after acharei elohim, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you today that ye shall surely perish."
Devarim,8,20,"As the Goyim which Hashem destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of Hashem Eloheichem."
Devarim,9,1,"Shema, Yisroel: Thou art to pass over Yarden today, to go in to possess Goyim greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and walled up to Shomayim,"
Devarim,9,2,"A people great and tall, the Bnei Anakim, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the Bnei Anak!"
Devarim,9,3,"Understand therefore this day, that Hashem Eloheicha is He which goeth over before thee; as a consuming eish He shall destroy them, and He shall bring them down before thy face; so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as Hashem hath said unto thee."
Devarim,9,4,"Speak not thou in thine lev, after that Hashem Eloheicha hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my tzedakah (righteousness) Hashem hath brought me in to possess this land; but for the wickedness of these Goyim Hashem doth drive them out from before thee."
Devarim,9,5,"Not for thy tzedakah, or for the yosher (uprightness) of thine lev, dost thou go to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these Goyim Hashem Eloheicha doth drive them out from before thee, and that He may perform the word which Hashem swore unto Avoteicha, Avraham, Yitzchak, and Ya'akov."
Devarim,9,6,"Understand therefore, that Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee not this ha'aretz hatovah to possess it for thy tzedakah; for thou art an Am Kesheh Oref (a stiffnecked people)."
Devarim,9,7,"Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst Hashem Eloheicha to wrath in the midbar; from the yom that thou didst depart out of Eretz Mitzrayim, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against Hashem."
Devarim,9,8,"Also in Chorev ye provoked Hashem to wrath, so that Hashem was angry with you to have destroyed you."
Devarim,9,9,"When I was gone up into the mount to receive the luchot ha'avanim, even the luchot HaBrit which Hashem cut with you, then I abode in the mount arba'im yom and arba'im lailah; I neither did eat lechem nor drink mayim;"
Devarim,9,10,"And Hashem delivered unto me shnei luchot ha'avanim written with the etzba Elohim (finger of G-d) ; and on them was written according to all the words, which Hashem spoke with you in the mount out of the midst of the eish in the Yom HaKahal."
Devarim,9,11,"And it came to pass at the end of arba'im yom and arba'im lailah, Hashem gave me the shnei luchot ha'avanim, even the Luchot HaBrit."
Devarim,9,12,"And Hashem said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Mitzrayim have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a massekhah (molten image)."
Devarim,9,13,"Furthermore Hashem spoke unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is an Am Kesheh Oref (stiffnecked people):"
Devarim,9,14,"Let Me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their shem from under Shomayim; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they."
Devarim,9,15,"So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with eish; and the shnei Luchot HaBrit were in my two hands."
Devarim,9,16,"And I looked, and, hinei, ye had sinned against Hashem Eloheicha, and had made you an egel massekhah (a molten calf) ; ye had turned aside quickly out of HaDerech (The Way) which Hashem had commanded you."
Devarim,9,17,"And I took the shnei haluchot, and cast them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes."
Devarim,9,18,"And I fell down before Hashem , as at the first, arba'im yom and arba'im lailah; I did neither eat lechem, nor drink mayim, because of kol chattatchem ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of Hashem , to provoke Him to anger."
Devarim,9,19,"For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith Hashem was angry against you to destroy you. But Hashem listened unto me at that time also."
Devarim,9,20,And Hashem was very angry with Aharon to have made him shmad; and I davened on behalf of Aharon also at that time.
Devarim,9,21,"And I took your sin, the egel which ye had made, and burned it with eish, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust; and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount."
Devarim,9,22,"And at Taverah, and at Massah, and at Kivrot-Hata'avah, ye provoked Hashem to wrath."
Devarim,9,23,"Likewise when Hashem sent you from Kadesh-Barnea, saying, Go up and possess ha'aretz which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of Hashem Eloheichem, and ye believed Him not, nor gave heed to His voice."
Devarim,9,24,Ye have been rebellious against Hashem from the yom that I knew you.
Devarim,9,25,"Thus I fell down before Hashem arba'im hayom and arba'im halailah, as I fell down at the first; because Hashem had said He would destroy you."
Devarim,9,26,"I davened therefore unto Hashem , and said, Adonoi Hashem , destroy not Thy people and Thine inheritance, which Thou hast redeemed through Thy greatness, which Thou hast brought forth out of Mitzrayim with a yad chazakah."
Devarim,9,27,"Remember Thy avadim, Avraham, Yitzchak, and Ya'akov; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin;"
Devarim,9,28,"Lest ha'aretz whence Thou broughtest us out say, Because Hashem was not able to bring them into ha'aretz which He promised them, and because He hated them, He hath brought them out to slay them in the midbar."
Devarim,9,29,"Yet they are Thy people and Thine nachalah, which Thou broughtest out by Thy koach hagadol and by Thy outstretched zero'a."
Devarim,10,1,"At that time Hashem said unto me, Carve thee shnei luchot avanim like unto the first, and come up unto Me into the mount, and make thee an aron etz."
Devarim,10,2,"And I will write on the luchot the devarim that were in haluchot harishonim which thou didst brake, and thou shalt put them in the aron."
Devarim,10,3,"And I made an aron of sheetim wood, and hewed shnei luchot avanim like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the shnei luchot in mine hand."
Devarim,10,4,"And He wrote on the luchot, according to the first writing, the Aseres HaDibros (Ten Commandments) , which Hashem spoke unto you in the mount out of the midst of the eish in the Yom HaKahal; and Hashem gave them unto me."
Devarim,10,5,"And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the luchot in the aron which I had made; and there they are, as Hashem commanded me."
Devarim,10,6,"And the Bnei Yisroel took their journey from Be'erot (Wells) of the Bnei Yaakan to Moserah; there Aharon died, and there he was buried; and El'azar bno ministered in the office of kohen in his place."
Devarim,10,7,"From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Yotvatah, an eretz of rivers of waters."
Devarim,10,8,"At that time Hashem separated the shevet (tribe) of Levi, to bear the Aron Brit Hashem , to stand before Hashem to minister unto Him, and to bless in Shmo, unto yom hazeh."
Devarim,10,9,"Therefore Levi hath no chelek nor nachalah with his brethren; Hashem is his nachalah, according as Hashem Eloheicha promised him."
Devarim,10,10,"And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, arba'im yamim and arba'im lailah; and Hashem listened unto me at that time also, and Hashem would not destroy thee."
Devarim,10,11,"And Hashem said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess ha'aretz, which I swore unto their avot to give unto them."
Devarim,10,12,"And now, Yisroel, what doth Hashem Eloheicha require of thee, but to fear Hashem Eloheicha, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve Hashem Eloheicha with all thy lev and with all thy nefesh,"
Devarim,10,13,"To be shomer over the mitzvot Hashem , and His chukkot, which I command thee today for thy good?"
Devarim,10,14,"Behold, the Shomayim and Shomei HaShomayim (the Highest Heaven) belongs to Hashem Eloheicha; Ha'Aretz also, with all that therein is."
Devarim,10,15,"Yet Hashem had a delight in Avoteicha to love them, and He chose their zera after them, even you above kol ha'amim, as it is yom hazeh."
Devarim,10,16,"Circumcise therefore the arlat (foreskin) of your lev, and be no more stiffnecked."
Devarim,10,17,"For Hashem Eloheichem is Elohei HaElohim, and Adonei HaAdonim, HaEl HaGadol, HaGibbor v'HaNorah, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh shochad (bribe):"
Devarim,10,18,"He doth execute the mishpat for the yatom and almanah, and loveth the ger, in giving him lechem and simlah (clothing)."
Devarim,10,19,Love ye therefore the ger; for ye were gerim in Eretz Mitzrayim.
Devarim,10,20,"Thou shalt fear Hashem Eloheicha; Him shalt thou serve, and to Him shalt thou have thy deveykus, and swear by Shmo."
Devarim,10,21,"He is thy tehillah (praise) , and He is Eloheicha, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen."
Devarim,10,22,Avoteicha went down into Mitzrayim with shivim nefesh; and now Hashem Eloheicha hath made thee as the kokhavim of Shomayim for multitude.
Devarim,11,1,"Therefore thou shalt love Hashem Eloheicha, and be shomer over His mishmeret (charge, what is to be preserved) , and His chukkot, and His mishpatim, and His mitzvot, always."
Devarim,11,2,"And know ye today; for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the musar of Hashem Eloheicha, His greatness, His yad chazakah, and His outstretched zero'a,"
Devarim,11,3,"And His otot, and His ma'asim, which He did in the midst of Mitzrayim unto Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, and unto all his land;"
Devarim,11,4,"And what He did unto the army of Mitzrayim, unto their susim, and to their chariots; how He made the mayim of Yam Suf to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how Hashem hath destroyed them unto yom hazeh;"
Devarim,11,5,"And what He did unto you in the midbar, until ye came into this place;"
Devarim,11,6,"And what He did unto Datan and Aviram, the bnei Eliav ben Reuven; how ha'aretz opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their oholim, and every living thing in their possession, in the midst of kol Yisroel;"
Devarim,11,7,But your eyes have seen kol ma'aseh hagadol Hashem which He did.
Devarim,11,8,"Therefore shall ye be shomer over all the mitzvot which I command you today, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess ha'aretz, whither ye go to possess it;"
Devarim,11,9,"And in order that ye may prolong your yamim on ha'adamah, which Hashem swore unto Avoteichem to give unto them and to their zera, Eretz Zavat Cholov U'devash (land that floweth with milk and honey)."
Devarim,11,10,"For ha'aretz, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as Eretz Mitzrayim, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy zera, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a gan (garden) of herbs:"
Devarim,11,11,"But ha'aretz, whither ye go to possess it, is an eretz of harim (hills) and beka'ot (valleys) , and drinketh mayim of the matar of Shomayim;"
Devarim,11,12,"An eretz which Hashem Eloheicha careth for; the eyes of Hashem Eloheicha are always upon it, from the reshit hashanah (beginning of the year) even unto the acharit shanah (end of the year)."
Devarim,11,13,"And it shall come to pass, if ye shall give heed diligently unto My mitzvot which I command you today, to love Hashem Eloheichem, and to serve Him with all your lev and with all your nefesh,"
Devarim,11,14,"That I will give you the matar (rain) of your land in its due season, the yoreh (early rain) and the malkosh (latter rain, spring rain) , that thou mayest gather in thy dagan (grain) , and thy tirosh (new wine) , and thine yitzhar (fresh oil)."
Devarim,11,15,"And I will send esev in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full."
Devarim,11,16,"Take heed to yourselves, that your lev be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve elohim acherim, and worship them;"
Devarim,11,17,"And then Hashem ʼs wrath be kindled against you, and He shut up the Shomayim, that there be no matar, and that ha'adamah yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish meherah (quickly) from off ha'aretz hatovah which Hashem giveth you."
Devarim,11,18,"Therefore shall ye lay up these My devarim in your lev and in your nefesh, and bind them for an ot upon your hand, that they may be as totafos (ornaments, Ex 13:16 , Shabbos 57a) between your eyes."
Devarim,11,19,"And ye shall teach them your banim, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine bais, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up."
Devarim,11,20,"And thou shalt write them upon the mezuzot of thine bais, and upon thy she'arim;"
Devarim,11,21,"That your yamim may be multiplied, and the yamim of your banim, in ha'adamah which Hashem swore unto Avoteichem to give them, as the yamim of Shomayim upon ha'aretz."
Devarim,11,22,"For if ye shall be shomer diligently over all these mitzvot which I command you, to do them, to love Hashem Eloheichem, to walk in all His ways, and to have deveykus unto Him;"
Devarim,11,23,"Then will Hashem drive out all these Goyim from before you, and ye shall possess Goyim gedolim and mightier than yourselves."
Devarim,11,24,"Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours; from the midbar and the Levanon, from the River, the river Euphrates, even unto the Western Sea shall your border be."
Devarim,11,25,"There shall no man be able to stand before you; for Hashem Eloheichem shall lay the pachad (terror, fear) of you and the dread of you upon kol ha'aretz that ye shall tread upon, as He hath said unto you."
Devarim,11,26,"See, I set before you today a brocha and a kelalah;"
Devarim,11,27,"A brocha, if ye obey the mitzvot Hashem Eloheichem, which I command you today;"
Devarim,11,28,"And a kelalah, if ye will not obey the mitzvot Hashem Eloheicha, but turn aside out of HaDerech which I command you today, to go after acharei elohim, which ye have not known."
Devarim,11,29,"And it shall come to pass, when Hashem Eloheicha hath brought thee in unto ha'aretz whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the brocha upon Mt Gerizim, and the kelalah upon Mt Eival."
Devarim,11,30,"Are they not on the other side of the Yarden, in the direction of the setting shemesh, in the Eretz Kena'ani, which dwell in the Aravah opposite Gilgal, near the oak of Moreh?"
Devarim,11,31,"For ye shall pass over Yarden to go in to possess ha'aretz which Hashem Eloheichem giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein."
Devarim,11,32,And ye shall be shomer to do all the chukkim and mishpatim which I set before you today.
Devarim,12,1,"These are the chukkim and mishpatim over which ye shall be shomer to do in ha'aretz, which Hashem Elohei Avoteicha giveth thee to possess it, kol hayamim that ye live upon ha'adamah."
Devarim,12,2,"Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the Goyim which ye shall possess served their elohim, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree;"
Devarim,12,3,"And ye shall overthrow their mizbechot, and break their matzeivot, and burn their Asherim with eish; and ye shall hew down peselim of their elohim, and destroy the names of them out of that place."
Devarim,12,4,Ye shall not do so unto Hashem Eloheichem.
Devarim,12,5,"But unto the place which Hashem Eloheichem shall choose out of all your shevatim to put Shmo there, even unto His habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:"
Devarim,12,6,"And thither ye shall bring your olot, and your zevakhim, and your ma'aseros (tithes) , and terumot (heave offerings) of your hand, and your nedarim (vows) , and your nedavot (freewill offerings) , and the bekhorot (firstlings) of your herds and of your flocks;"
Devarim,12,7,"And there ye shall eat before Hashem Eloheichem, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein Hashem Eloheicha hath blessed thee."
Devarim,12,8,"Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here today, ish koh hayashar be'einav (every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes)."
Devarim,12,9,"For ye are not as yet come to the menuchah (resting place) and to the nachalah, which Hashem Eloheicha giveth you."
Devarim,12,10,"But when ye go over Yarden, and dwell in ha'aretz which Hashem Eloheichem giveth you to inherit, and when He giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;"
Devarim,12,11,"Then there shall be a place which Hashem Eloheichem shall choose to cause Shmo to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your olot, and your zevakhim, your ma'aseros (tithes) , and the terumah (heave offering) of your hand, and all your choice nedarim (vows) which ye vow unto Hashem;"
Devarim,12,12,"And ye shall rejoice before Hashem Eloheichem, ye, and your banim, and your banot, and your avadim, and your maidservants, and the Levi that is within your she'arim; forasmuch as he hath no chelek nor nachalah with you."
Devarim,12,13,Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy olot in every place that thou seest;
Devarim,12,14,"But in the place which Hashem shall choose in one of thy shevatim, there thou shalt offer thy olot, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee."
Devarim,12,15,"Notwithstanding, thou mayest kill and eat basar in all thy she'arim, whatsoever thy nefesh desireth, according to the birkat Hashem Eloheicha which He hath given thee; hatameh (the unclean) and hatahor (the clean) may eat thereof, as if it were gazelle or deer."
Devarim,12,16,Only ye shall not eat the dahm; ye shall pour it upon ha'aretz as mayim.
Devarim,12,17,"Thou mayest not eat within thy she'arim the ma'aser (tithe) of thy dagan (grain) , or of thy tirosh (new wine) , or of thy yitzhar (fresh oil) , or the bekhorot (firstlings) of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy nedarim (vows) which thou vowest, nor thy nedavot (freewill offerings) , or terumah (heave offering) of thine hand;"
Devarim,12,18,"But thou must eat them before Hashem Eloheicha in the place which Hashem Eloheicha shall choose, thou, and thy ben, and thy bat, and thy eved, and thy amah, and the Levi that is within thy she'arim; and thou shalt rejoice before Hashem Eloheicha in all that thou puttest thine hands unto."
Devarim,12,19,Be shomer to thyself that thou forsake not the Levi as long as thou livest upon ha'adamah.
Devarim,12,20,"When Hashem Eloheicha shall enlarge thy border, as He hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat basar, because thy nefesh longeth to eat basar; thou mayest eat basar, whatsoever thy nefesh desireth after."
Devarim,12,21,"If the place which Hashem Eloheicha hath chosen to put Shmo there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which Hashem hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy she'arim whatsoever thy nefesh desireth after."
Devarim,12,22,"Even as the gazelle and the deer is eaten, so thou shalt eat them; the tameh (unclean) and the tahor (clean) shall eat of them alike."
Devarim,12,23,Only be sure that thou eat not the dahm; for the dahm is the nefesh; and thou mayest not eat the nefesh with the basar.
Devarim,12,24,Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon ha'aretz as mayim.
Devarim,12,25,"Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy banim after thee, when thou shalt do that which is yashar in the sight of Hashem."
Devarim,12,26,"Only thy kadashim (holy things) which thou hast, and thy nedarim (vows) , thou shalt take, and go unto the place which Hashem shall choose;"
Devarim,12,27,"And thou shalt offer thy olot, the basar and the dahm, upon the Mizbe'ach of Hashem Eloheicha; and the dahm of thy zevakhim (sacrifices) shall be poured out upon the mizbe'ach of Hashem Eloheicha, and thou shalt eat the basar."
Devarim,12,28,"Be shomer and heed all these devarim which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy banim after thee ad olam, when thou doest that which is tov and yashar in the sight of Hashem Eloheicha."
Devarim,12,29,"When Hashem Eloheicha shall cut off the Goyim from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou displace them, and dwellest in their land;"
Devarim,12,30,"Be shomer to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their elohim, saying, How did these Goyim serve their elohim? Even so will I do likewise."
Devarim,12,31,"Thou shalt not do so unto Hashem Eloheicha; for kol to'avat Hashem (every abomination to Hashem ), which He hateth, have they done unto their elohim; for even their banim and their banot they have burned in the eish to their elohim."
Devarim,12,32,"What thing soever I command you, be shomer to do it; thou shalt not add thereto, nor take away or diminish from it."
Devarim,13,1,"If there arise among you a navi, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee an ot (sign) or a mofet (wonder),"
Devarim,13,2,"And the ot (sign) or the mofet (wonder) come to pass, whereof he spoke unto thee, saying, Let us go after elohim acherim, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;"
Devarim,13,3,"Thou shalt not give heed unto the devarim of that navi, or that dreamer of dreams; for Hashem Eloheichem is testing you, to know whether ye love Hashem Eloheichem with all your lev and with all your nefesh."
Devarim,13,4,"Ye shall walk after Hashem Eloheichem, and fear Him, and be shomer over His mitzvot, and obey His voice, and ye shall serve Him, and have deveykus unto Him."
Devarim,13,5,"And that navi, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from Hashem Eloheichem, which brought you out of Eretz Mitzrayim, and redeemed you out of the bais avadim, to entice thee from HaDerech which Hashem Eloheicha commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put harah away from the midst of thee."
Devarim,13,6,"If achicha (thy brother) , the ben of thy em, or thy ben, or thy bat, or the eshet kheyk of thee (wife of thy bosom) , or thy friend, which is as thine own nefesh, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve elohim acherim, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy avot;"
Devarim,13,7,"Namely, of the elohei ha'amim which are round about you, near unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one ketzeh ha'aretz (end of the earth) even unto the other ketzeh ha'aretz;"
Devarim,13,8,"Thou shalt not yield unto him, nor give heed unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him;"
Devarim,13,9,"But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of kol HaAm."
Devarim,13,10,"And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from Hashem Eloheicha, which brought thee out of Eretz Mitzrayim, from the bais avadim."
Devarim,13,11,"And kol Yisroel shall hear, and fear, and shall not again do such wickedness as this is among you."
Devarim,13,12,"If thou shalt hear say in one of thy towns, which Hashem Eloheicha hath given thee to dwell there, saying,"
Devarim,13,13,"Certain men, the bnei Beliyaal (reprobate, worthless men) , are gone out from among you, and have enticed the inhabitants of their town, saying, Let us go and serve elohim acherim, which ye have not known;"
Devarim,13,14,"Then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, hinei, if it be emes, and the thing certain, that such to'evah (abomination, detestable action) is wrought among you;"
Devarim,13,15,"Thou shalt surely strike the inhabitants of that town with the edge of the cherev, in cherem destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the cherev."
Devarim,13,16,"And thou shalt gather all the plunder of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with eish the town, and all the plunder thereof completely for Hashem Eloheicha; and it shall be a tel olam (heap forever) ; it shall not be built again."
Devarim,13,17,"And there shall cling none of the accursed thing to thine hand; that Hashem may turn from the fierceness of His anger, and show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as He hath sworn unto Avoteicha;"
Devarim,13,18,"When thou shalt give heed to the voice of Hashem Eloheicha, to be shomer over all His mitzvot which I command thee today, to do that which is yashar (right, straight) in the eyes of Hashem Eloheicha."
Devarim,14,1,"Ye are the bnei Hashem Eloheichem; ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead."
Devarim,14,2,"For thou art an Am Kadosh unto Hashem Eloheicha, and Hashem hath chosen thee to be an Am Segullah (treasured people) unto Himself, above kol haamim that are upon ha'adamah."
Devarim,14,3,Thou shalt not eat any to'evah (detestable thing).
Devarim,14,4,"These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the shor, the seh, and the izzim,"
Devarim,14,5,"The deer, and the gazelle, and the yachmur, and the akko, and the antelope, and the wild ox, and the wild goat."
Devarim,14,6,"And every beast that parteth the hoof, and is separated in two hooves, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat."
Devarim,14,7,"Nevertheless, these ye shall not eat of them that only chew the cud, or of them that only divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the coney; for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are tameh (unclean) unto you."
Devarim,14,8,"And the chazir, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is tameh (unclean) unto you; ye shall not eat of their basar, nor touch their nevelah (dead carcass)."
Devarim,14,9,"These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat,"
Devarim,14,10,And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is tameh (unclean) unto you.
Devarim,14,11,Of all tahorah (clean) birds ye shall eat.
Devarim,14,12,"But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the nesher, and the vulture, and the bearded vulture,"
Devarim,14,13,"And the kite, and the buzzard after its kind,"
Devarim,14,14,"And every raven after its kind,"
Devarim,14,15,"And the owl, and the night hawk, and the seagull, and the hawk after its kind,"
Devarim,14,16,"The little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl,"
Devarim,14,17,"And the pelican, and the osprey, and the cormorant,"
Devarim,14,18,"And the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat."
Devarim,14,19,And every creeping thing that flieth is tameh (unclean) unto you; they shall not be eaten.
Devarim,14,20,But of all tahor (clean) fowls ye may eat.
Devarim,14,21,"Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself; thou shalt give it unto the ger that is in thy she'arim, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien; for thou art an Am Kadosh unto Hashem Eloheicha. Thou shalt not boil a young goat in its motherʼs cholov."
Devarim,14,22,"Thou shalt truly give ma'aser (tithe) of all the increase of thy zera, that the sadeh bringeth forth year by year."
Devarim,14,23,"And thou shalt eat before Hashem Eloheicha, in the place which He shall choose to place Shmo there, the ma'aser (tithe) of thy dagan (grain) , of thy tirosh (new wine) , and of thine yitzhar (fresh oil) , and the bekhorot (firstlings) of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to stand in awe of Hashem Eloheicha always."
Devarim,14,24,"And if the journey be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which Hashem Eloheicha shall choose to set Shmo there, when Hashem Eloheicha hath blessed thee;"
Devarim,14,25,"Then shalt thou exchange it for kesef, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which Hashem Eloheicha shall choose;"
Devarim,14,26,"And thou shalt spend that kesef for whatsoever thy nefesh desireth after, for cattle, or for sheep, or for yayin, or for shechar (fermented drink) , or for whatsoever thy nefesh desireth; and thou shalt eat there before Hashem Eloheicha, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household,"
Devarim,14,27,And the Levi that is within thy she'arim; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no chelek nor nachalah with thee.
Devarim,14,28,"At the end of shalosh shanim thou shalt bring forth all the ma'aser (tithe) of thine increase the same year, and shalt store it up within thy she'arim:"
Devarim,14,29,"And the Levi (because he hath no chelek nor nachalah with thee) and the ger, and the yatom, and the almanah, which are within thy she'arim, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that Hashem Eloheicha may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest."
Devarim,15,1,At the end of every shevat shanim thou shalt make a shemittah (release).
Devarim,15,2,"And this is the manner of the shemittah: Every creditor that lendeth whatever unto his neighbor shall cancel the debt; he shall not exact it of his neighbor, or of his brother; because it is called Hashem ʼs Shemittah."
Devarim,15,3,Of a nokhri thou mayest require a debt to be repaid; but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release the claim;
Devarim,15,4,"There shall be no evyon (needy, poor) among you; for Hashem shall greatly bless thee in ha'aretz which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee for a nachalah to possess it;"
Devarim,15,5,If only thou carefully give heed unto the voice of Hashem Eloheicha to be shomer to do all these mitzvot which I command thee today.
Devarim,15,6,"For Hashem Eloheicha blesseth thee, as He promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto Goyim rabbim, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over Goyim rabbim, but they shall not reign over thee."
Devarim,15,7,"If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy she'arim in thy land which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine lev, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:"
Devarim,15,8,"But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his machsor (need) , in that which he wanteth."
Devarim,15,9,"Beware that there be not a thought in thy lev beliyaal, saying, The seventh year, the shnat hashemittah (the year of release) , is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto Hashem against thee, and it be chet (sin) unto thee."
Devarim,15,10,"Thou shalt surely give him, and thine lev shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him; because that for this thing Hashem Eloheicha shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto."
Devarim,15,11,"For the poor shall never cease out of ha'aretz; therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land."
Devarim,15,12,"And if thy brother, an Ivri (a Hebrew) , or an Ivriyyah (Hebrew woman) , be sold unto thee, and serve thee shesh shanim; then in the shanah hashevi'it thou shalt let him go free from thee."
Devarim,15,13,"And when thou sendest him out chafshi (free) from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty-handed:"
Devarim,15,14,"Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy tzon, and out of thy threshing floor, and out of thy winepress; of that wherewith Hashem Eloheicha hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him."
Devarim,15,15,"And thou shalt remember that thou wast an eved in Eretz Mitzrayim, and Hashem Eloheicha redeemed thee; therefore I command thee this thing today."
Devarim,15,16,"And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine bais, because he fares well with thee;"
Devarim,15,17,"Then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his ear unto the delet, and he shall be thy eved olam. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise."
Devarim,15,18,"It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away chafshi (free) from thee; for he hath been worth twice that of a hired eved to thee, in serving thee shesh shanim; and Hashem Eloheicha shall bless thee in all that thou doest."
Devarim,15,19,"Kol habechor (all firstling males) that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt set apart as kodesh unto Hashem Eloheicha; thou shalt do no work with the bechor of thy ox, nor shear the bechor of thy sheep."
Devarim,15,20,"Thou shalt eat it before Hashem Eloheicha shanah b'shanah (year by year) in the place which Hashem shall choose, thou and thy household."
Devarim,15,21,"And if there be any mum therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any serious defect, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto Hashem Eloheicha."
Devarim,15,22,"Thou shalt eat it within thy she'arim; the tameh (unclean) and the tahor (clean) person shall eat it alike, as the gazelle, and as the deer."
Devarim,15,23,Only thou shalt not eat the dahm thereof; thou shalt pour it upon ha'aretz as mayim.
Devarim,16,1,"Be shomer of the month of Aviv, and perform the Pesach offering unto Hashem Eloheicha; for in the month of Aviv Hashem Eloheicha brought thee forth out of Mitzrayim by lailah."
Devarim,16,2,"Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Pesach unto Hashem Eloheicha, of the tzon and the herd, in the place which Hashem shall choose to place Shmo there."
Devarim,16,3,"Thou shalt eat no chametz with it; shivat yamim shalt thou eat matzot therewith, even the lechem oni (bread of affliction) ; for thou camest forth out of Eretz Mitzrayim in haste in order that thou mayest remember the yom when thou camest forth out of Eretz Mitzrayim kol yemei chayyechah (all the days of thy life)."
Devarim,16,4,"And there shall be no se'or (leaven) seen with thee in all thy territory shivat yamim; neither shall there any thing of the basar, which thou sacrificedst ba'Erev baYom HaRishon, remain overnight until the boker."
Devarim,16,5,"Thou mayest not sacrifice the Pesach within any of thy she'arim, which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee;"
Devarim,16,6,"But at the place which Hashem Eloheicha shall choose to place Shmo in, there thou shalt sacrifice the Pesach at erev, at the going down of the shemesh, at the mo'ed (appointed time) that thou camest forth out of Mitzrayim."
Devarim,16,7,"And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which Hashem Eloheicha shall choose; and thou shalt turn back in the boker, and go unto thy oholim."
Devarim,16,8,Sheshet yamim thou shalt eat matzot; and on the yom hashevi'i shall be an atzeret (assembly) to Hashem Eloheicha; thou shalt do no melachah (work) therein.
Devarim,16,9,Shivah shavu'ot (seven weeks) shalt thou number unto thee; begin to number the shivah shavu'ot from such time as thou begin to put the sickle to the standing crop.
Devarim,16,10,"And thou shalt observe Chag Shavuos unto Hashem Eloheicha by giving a terumah (freewill offering) of thine hand, which thou shalt give unto Hashem Eloheicha, according as Hashem Eloheicha hath blessed thee:"
Devarim,16,11,"And thou shalt rejoice before Hashem Eloheicha, thou, and thy ben, and thy bat, and thy eved, and thy amah, and the Levi that is within thy she'arim, and the ger, and the yatom (orphan) , and the almanah, that are among you, in the place which Hashem Eloheicha hath chosen to place Shmo there."
Devarim,16,12,And thou shalt remember that thou wast an eved in Mitzrayim: and thou shalt be shomer and do these chukkim.
Devarim,16,13,"Chag HaSukkot shalt thou observe shivat yamim, after that thou hast gathered in from thy threshing floor and from thy winepress:"
Devarim,16,14,"And thou shalt rejoice in thy chag (feast) , thou, and thy ben, and thy bat, and thy eved, and thy amah, and the Levi, the ger, and the yatom (orphan) , and the almanah, that are within thy she'arim."
Devarim,16,15,"Shivat yamim shalt thou observe the chag (feast) unto Hashem Eloheicha in the place which Hashem shall choose, because Hashem Eloheicha shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, so that thou shalt surely rejoice."
Devarim,16,16,"Shalosh pe'amim bashanah shall all thy males appear before Hashem Eloheicha in the place which He shall choose; in the Chag Matzot, and in the Chag HaShavu'os, and in the Chag HaSukkot, and they shall not appear before Hashem empty-handed:"
Devarim,16,17,"Every man shall give as he is able, according to the Birkat Hashem Eloheicha which He hath given thee."
Devarim,16,18,"Shofetim and shoterim shalt thou appoint thee in all thy she'arim, which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee, throughout thy shevatim: and they shall judge HaAm with mishpat-tzedek."
Devarim,16,19,"Thou shalt not pervert mishpat; thou shalt not show partiality, neither take a shochad: for a bribe doth blind the eyes of the chachamim, and twist the devarim of the tzaddikim."
Devarim,16,20,"Tzedek tzedek (that which is altogether just) shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit ha'aretz which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee."
Devarim,16,21,"Thou shalt not plant any tree as an Asherah near unto the Mizbe'ach of Hashem Eloheicha, which thou shalt make thee."
Devarim,16,22,Neither shalt thou set thee up any matzeivah (idolatrous pillar) ; which Hashem Eloheicha hateth.
Devarim,17,1,"Thou shalt not sacrifice unto Hashem Eloheicha any ox, or sheep, wherein is mum (blemish) , or any evil thing, any defect: for that is a to'avat (abomination) unto Hashem Eloheicha."
Devarim,17,2,"If there be found among you, within any of thy she'arim which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee, ish or isha, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of Hashem Eloheicha, in transgressing His Brit,"
Devarim,17,3,"And hath gone and served elohim acherim, and worshiped them, either the shemesh, or yarei'ach, or any of the tz'vah HaShomayim, which I have not commanded;"
Devarim,17,4,"And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and inquired diligently, and, hinei, it be emes, and the thing nakhon (certain, correct) , that such to'evah (abomination) is wrought in Yisroel,"
Devarim,17,5,"Then shalt thou bring forth that ish or that isha, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy she'arim, even that ish or that isha, and shalt stone them with avanim, till they die."
Devarim,17,6,"At the mouth of shneym edim, or shloshah edim, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of ed echad (one witness) he shall not be put to death."
Devarim,17,7,"The hands of the edim shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of kol haAm. So thou shalt put harah (the evil) away from among you."
Devarim,17,8,"If there arise a matter too hard for thee in mishpat, between dahm and dahm, between din and din, and between nega and nega, being matters of controversy within thy she'arim, then shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which Hashem Eloheicha shall choose;"
Devarim,17,9,"And thou shalt come unto the kohanim, who are the Levi'im, and unto the Shofet that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall show thee the devar hamishpat (word of judgment);"
Devarim,17,10,"And thou shalt do according to the devar, which they of that place which Hashem shall choose shall show thee; and thou shalt be shomer to do according to all that they teach thee;"
Devarim,17,11,"According to the pi hatorah which they shall teach thee, and according to the mishpat which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do; thou shalt not turn aside from the devar which they shall show thee, to the right hand, nor to the left."
Devarim,17,12,"And the ish that will do presumptuously, and will not give heed unto the kohen that standeth to minister there before Hashem Eloheicha, or unto the Shofet, even that ish shall die; and thou shalt put away harah from Yisroel."
Devarim,17,13,"And kol haAm shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously."
Devarim,17,14,"When thou art come unto ha'aretz which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a melech over me, like Kol HaGoyim that are about me;"
Devarim,17,15,"Thou shalt in any wise set him as melech over thee, whom Hashem Eloheicha shall choose; one from among thy achim shalt thou set as melech over thee; thou mayest not set an ish nokhri over thee, which is not achicha (thy brother, i.e., a fellow Hebrew)."
Devarim,17,16,"But he shall not multiply susim to himself, nor cause the people to return to Mitzrayim, to the end that he should multiply the sus; forasmuch as Hashem hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way."
Devarim,17,17,"Neither shall he multiply nashim to himself, that his lev turn not away; neither shall he greatly multiply to himself kesef and zahav."
Devarim,17,18,"And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the kisei mamlakhto (throne of his kingdom) , that he shall write him a mishneh hatorah hazot (copy of this torah) in a sefer out of that which is before the kohanim, the Levi'im;"
Devarim,17,19,"And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear Hashem Elohav, to be shomer over kol divrei hatorah hazot and these chukkim, to do them;"
Devarim,17,20,"That his lev be not lifted up in pride above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the mitzvah, to the right hand, or to the left; to the end that he may prolong his days in his mamlachah, he, and his banim, in the midst of Yisroel."
Devarim,18,1,"The kohanim, who are Levi'im, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no chelek nor nachalah with Yisroel; they shall eat the offerings of Hashem made by eish, even His nachalah."
Devarim,18,2,"Therefore shall they have no nachalah among their achim; Hashem is their nachalah, as He hath said unto them."
Devarim,18,3,"And this shall be the mishpat hakohanim (the right of the kohanim) from the people, from them that offer the zevach, whether it be shor or seh; and they shall give unto the kohen the shoulder, and the two jowls, and the stomach."
Devarim,18,4,"The reshit also of thy grain, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the reshit of the shearing of thy tzon, shalt thou give him."
Devarim,18,5,"For Hashem Eloheicha hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the Shem of Hashem , he and his banim kol hayamim."
Devarim,18,6,"And if a Levi come from any of thy she'arim (gates, i.e., towns) out of kol Yisroel, where he is living, and come with all the earnestness of his nefesh unto the place which Hashem shall choose;"
Devarim,18,7,"Then he shall minister in the Shem of Hashem Elohav, as all his achim the Levi'im do, which stand there before Hashem."
Devarim,18,8,"They shall have chelek k'chelek (like portions) to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony."
Devarim,18,9,"When thou art come into ha'aretz which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to imitate the to'avot (abominations) of those Goyim."
Devarim,18,10,"There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his ben or his bat to pass through the eish or kosem kesamim (a diviner of divination) or a m'onen (soothsayer, astrologer) , or a m'nachesh (one who interprets omens) , or a mekhashshef (witch)."
Devarim,18,11,"Or one who casts spells, or one who inquires of a ghost or a familiar spirit, or a doresh el hamesim (a consulter of the dead ones, i.e., a necromancer)."
Devarim,18,12,"For all that do these things are a to'avat Hashem ; and because of these to'evot, Hashem Eloheicha is about to drive them out before thee."
Devarim,18,13,Thou shalt be tamim (blameless) before Hashem Eloheicha.
Devarim,18,14,"For these Goyim, which thou shalt dispossess, paid heed unto soothsayers, and unto diviners; but as for thee, Hashem Eloheicha hath not suffered thee so to do."
Devarim,18,15," Hashem Eloheicha will raise up unto thee a Navi from among thee, of thy achim, kamoni (like me); unto him ye must listen;"
Devarim,18,16,"According to all that thou desiredst of Hashem Eloheicha in Chorev in the Yom HaKahal, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of Hashem Elohav, neither let me see this eish hagedolah any more, that I die not."
Devarim,18,17,"And Hashem said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken."
Devarim,18,18,"I will raise them up a Navi from among their achim, like unto thee, and will put My words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him."
Devarim,18,19,"And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not listen unto My words which he shall speak Bishmi (in My Name) , I will require it of him."
Devarim,18,20,"But the navi, which shall presume to speak a word Bishmi (In My Name) , which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the shem of elohim acharim, even that navi shall die."
Devarim,18,21,"And if thou say in thine lev, How shall we know the word which Hashem hath not spoken?"
Devarim,18,22,"When a navi speaketh b'Shem Hashem , if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which Hashem hath not spoken, but the navi hath spoken it bezadon (in zadon); thou shalt not be afraid of him."
Devarim,19,1,"When Hashem Eloheicha hath cut off the Goyim, whose land Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee, and thou dispossess them, and dwellest in their towns, and in their batim (houses),"
Devarim,19,2,"Thou shalt separate shalosh arim (three towns) for thee in the midst of thy land, which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee to possess it."
Devarim,19,3,"Thou shalt prepare yourselves roads, and divide the territory of thy land, which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee there."
Devarim,19,4,"And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee there, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbor without da'as, whom he hated not in time past;"
Devarim,19,5,"As when an ish goeth into the wood with his neighbor to cut wood, his hand swings a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, the head slippeth from the handle, and strikes upon his neighbor, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those towns, and live;"
Devarim,19,6,"Lest the Go'el HaDahm pursue the slayer, while his lev is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past."
Devarim,19,7,"Therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate shalosh arim for thee."
Devarim,19,8,"And if Hashem Eloheicha enlarge thy territory, as He hath sworn unto Avoteicha, and give thee kol ha'aretz which He promised to give unto Avoteicha;"
Devarim,19,9,"If thou shalt be shomer over all these mitzvot to do them, which I command thee today, to love Hashem Eloheicha, and to walk ever in His ways; then shalt thou add three towns more for thee, beside these three;"
Devarim,19,10,"That dahm naki (innocent blood) be not shed in thy land, which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee for a nachalah, and so damim be upon thee."
Devarim,19,11,"But if any ish hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and strike him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these towns;"
Devarim,19,12,"Then the zekenim of his town shall send and have him taken from there, and deliver him into the yad of the Goel HaDahm, that he may die."
Devarim,19,13,"Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt of dahm naki from Yisroel, that it may go well with thee."
Devarim,19,14,"Thou shalt not remove thy neighborʼs landmark, which they of old time have set in thine nachalah, which thou shalt inherit in the eretz that Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee to possess it."
Devarim,19,15,"Ed echad shall not rise up against an ish for any avon (iniquity) , or for any chattat (sin) , in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of shney edim, or at the mouth of shloshah edim, shall the matter be established."
Devarim,19,16,"If an ed chamas (malicious, false witness) rise up against any ish to testify against him that which is wrong;"
Devarim,19,17,"Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before Hashem , before the kohanim and the shofetim, which shall be in those days;"
Devarim,19,18,"And the shofetim shall make diligent inquiry; and, hinei, if the witness be an ed sheker (false witness) , and hath testified falsely against his brother;"
Devarim,19,19,"Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put harah away from among you."
Devarim,19,20,"And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such rah among you."
Devarim,19,21,"And thine eye shall not pity; but nefesh shall go for nefesh, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, yad for yad, regel for regel."
Devarim,20,1,"When thou goest out to milchamah against thine enemies, and seest sus (horses) , and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them; for Hashem Eloheicha is with thee, which brought thee up out of Eretz Mitzrayim."
Devarim,20,2,"And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the milchamah, that the kohen shall approach and speak unto the people,"
Devarim,20,3,"And shall say unto them, Shema, Yisroel, ye approach today unto milchamah against your enemies; let not your hearts faint; fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;"
Devarim,20,4,"For Hashem Eloheicha is He that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you."
Devarim,20,5,"And the shoterim shall speak unto the people, saying, What ish is there that hath built a bais chadash, and hath not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his bais, lest he die in the milchamah, and another ish dedicate it."
Devarim,20,6,"And what ish is he that hath planted a kerem (vineyard) , and hath not yet eaten of it? Let him also go and return unto his bais, lest he die in the milchamah, and another ish eat of it."
Devarim,20,7,"And what ish is there that hath betrothed an isha, and hath not taken her? Let him go and return unto his bais, lest he die in the milchamah, and another ish take her."
Devarim,20,8,"And the shoterim shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What ish is there that is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go and return unto his bais, lest his brethrenʼs lev faint as well as his lev."
Devarim,20,9,"And it shall be, when the shoterim have made an end of speaking unto the people that they shall appoint sarei tzvaos to lead the people."
Devarim,20,10,"When thou comest nigh unto a town to fight against it, then proclaim an offer of shalom unto it."
Devarim,20,11,"And it shall be, if it make thee answer of shalom, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that kol haAm that is found therein shall be servants, placed under tribute unto thee, and they shall serve thee."
Devarim,20,12,"And if it will make no shalom with thee, but engages in milchamah against thee, then thou shalt besiege it;"
Devarim,20,13,"And when Hashem Eloheicha hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt strike every male thereof with the edge of the cherev;"
Devarim,20,14,"But the nashim, and the little ones, and the behemah, and all that is in the town, even all the plunder thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the plunder of thine enemies Hashem Eloheicha hath given thee."
Devarim,20,15,"Thus shalt thou do unto all the towns which are very far off from thee, which are not of the towns of these Goyim."
Devarim,20,16,"But of the towns of these people, which Hashem Eloheicha doth give thee for a nachalah, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth;"
Devarim,20,17,"But thou shalt utterly put them under cherem of destruction; namely, the Chitti, and the Emori, the Kena'ani, and the Perizzi, the Chivi, and the Yevusi; as Hashem Eloheicha hath commanded thee;"
Devarim,20,18,That they teach you not to do after all their to'evot (abominations) which they have done unto their elohim; so that ye would sin against Hashem Eloheichem.
Devarim,20,19,"When thou shalt besiege a town yamim rabbim, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them; although thou mayest eat of them, thou shalt not cut them down. Are the etz hasadeh men that they should come under your siege?"
Devarim,20,20,"Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for food, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build siege works against the town that maketh milchamah with thee, until it be subdued."
Devarim,21,1,"If one be found slain in ha'adamah which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee to possess it, lying in the sadeh, and it be not known who hath slain him;"
Devarim,21,2,"Then thy zekenim and thy shofetim shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the towns which are round about him that is slain;"
Devarim,21,3,"And it shall be, that the town which is next unto the slain man, even the zekenim of that town shall take a heifer, which hath not been worked with, and which hath not pulled the ol (yoke);"
Devarim,21,4,"And the zekenim of that town shall bring down the heifer unto a wadi with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heiferʼs neck there in the wadi;"
Devarim,21,5,"And the kohanim the Bnei Levi shall come near; for them Hashem Eloheicha hath chosen to minister unto Him, and to bless in the Shem of Hashem ; and by their word shall every controversy and every assault be tried;"
Devarim,21,6,"And all the zekenim of that town, that are next unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley;"
Devarim,21,7,"And they shall answer and say, Yadeinu (our hands) are not guilty of shefach dahm (shedding blood) , neither have our eyes seen it."
Devarim,21,8,"Kapper (atone) , O Hashem , for Thy people Yisroel, whom Thou hast redeemed, and lay not dahm naki (innocent blood) unto the charge of Thy people Yisroel. And the shefach dahm shall be atoned for."
Devarim,21,9,"So shalt thou put away the guilt of dahm naki from among you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of Hashem."
Devarim,21,10,"When thou goest forth to milchamah against thine enemies, and Hashem Eloheicha hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive,"
Devarim,21,11,"And seest among the captives an eshet yefat to'ar (a woman who is beautiful of form) , and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to be thy wife;"
Devarim,21,12,"Then thou shalt bring her home to thine bais, and she shall shave her rosh, and trim her nails;"
Devarim,21,13,"And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine bais, and mourn her av and her em a full month; and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her ba'al, and she shall be thy isha."
Devarim,21,14,"And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for kesef, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her."
Devarim,21,15,"If an ish have two nashim, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him banim, both the beloved and the hated; and if the bechor be hers that was hated;"
Devarim,21,16,"Then it shall be, on the yom when he wills his possessions to his banim, that he may not make the ben of the beloved bechor before the ben of the hated, which is indeed the bechor;"
Devarim,21,17,"But he shall acknowledge the ben of the hated for the bechor, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the beginning of his strength; the mishpat habechorah (right of the firstborn) is his."
Devarim,21,18,"If an ish have a stubborn and rebellious ben, which will not obey the voice of his av, or the voice of his em, and that, when they have chastened him, will not give heed unto them;"
Devarim,21,19,"Then shall his av and his em lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the zekenim of his town, and unto the sha'ar (gate) of his place;"
Devarim,21,20,"And they shall say unto the zekenim of his town, This our ben is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a zolel (glutton) and a soveh (drunkard)."
Devarim,21,21,"And all the men of his town shall stone him with avanim (stones) , that he die; so shalt thou put harah away from among you; and all Yisroel shall hear and fear."
Devarim,21,22,"And if an ish have committed a chet (sin) mishpat mavet (worthy of death) , and he is put to death, and thou hang him on an etz;"
Devarim,21,23,"His nevelah shall not remain all night upon the etz, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; for he that is talui (hanged) is under Kilelat Elohim (curse of G-d) ; that thy adamah be not defiled, which Hashem Eloheicha giveth thee for a nachalah."
Devarim,22,1,"Thou shalt not see thy brotherʼs shor or his seh go astray, and ignore them; thou shalt in any case bring them back unto thy brother."
Devarim,22,2,"And if thy brother be not near unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own bais, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again."
Devarim,22,3,"In like manner shalt thou do with his chamor; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost things of thy brotherʼs, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise; thou mayest not ignore it."
Devarim,22,4,"Thou shalt not see thy brotherʼs chamor or his shor fall down by the road, and ignore them; thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again."
Devarim,22,5,The isha shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a gever (man) neither shall a gever put on simlat isha (garment of a woman) ; for all that do so are to'avat unto Hashem Eloheicha.
Devarim,22,6,"If a birdʼs ken (nest) chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the mother is roosting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the mother with the young;"
Devarim,22,7,"But thou shalt in any wise let the mother go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy yamim."
Devarim,22,8,"When thou buildest a bais chadash, then thou shalt make a parapet for thy roof, that thou bring not dahm (blood guiltiness) upon thine bais, if any fall from thence."
Devarim,22,9,"Thou shalt not sow thy kerem with different seeds; lest the fruit of thy zera which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy kerem, be defiled."
Devarim,22,10,Thou shalt not plow with a shor and a chamor together.
Devarim,22,11,"Thou shalt not wear a garment of Shaanetz, as of woolen and linen together."
Devarim,22,12,"Thou shalt make thee gedilim (fringes, tzitzis, twisted threads) upon the four corners of thy garment, wherewith thou coverest thyself."
Devarim,22,13,"If any ish take an isha, and go in unto her, and hate her,"
Devarim,22,14,"And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up a shem rah (bad name) upon her, and say, I took this isha, and when I came to her, I found her with no betulim (proofs of virginity);"
Devarim,22,15,"Then shall the av of the na'arah, and her em, take and bring forth the betulim (proofs of virginity) unto the zekenim of the town in the sha'arah (gate);"
Devarim,22,16,"And the avi hana'arah shall say unto the zekenim, I gave my bat unto this ish as isha (wife) and he hateth her;"
Devarim,22,17,"And, hinei, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying, I found not thy bat with betulim; and yet these are my batʼs betulim. And they shall spread the simlah (clothing) before the zekenim of the town."
Devarim,22,18,And the zekenim of that town shall take that ish and punish him;
Devarim,22,19,"And they shall fine him a hundred shekels of kesef, and give them unto the avi hana'arah, because he hath brought a shem rah (bad name) upon a betulat Yisroel; and she shall be his isha; he may not put her away all his yamim."
Devarim,22,20,"But if this thing be emes, and the betulim be not found for the na'arah;"
Devarim,22,21,"Then they shall bring out the na'arah to the door of her bais avi, and the anashim of her town shall stone her with avanim that she die; because she hath committed an outrage in Yisroel, to play the whore in her bais avi; so shalt thou put away the rah from among you."
Devarim,22,22,"If an ish be found lying with an isha married to a husband then they shall both of them die, both the ish that lay with the isha, and the isha; so shalt thou put away the rah from Yisroel."
Devarim,22,23,"If a na'arah that is a betulah be betrothed unto a husband, and an ish find her in the town, and lie with her;"
Devarim,22,24,"Then ye shall bring them both out unto the sha'ar of that town, and ye shall stone them with avanim that they die; the na'arah, because she cried not, being in the town; and the ish, because he hath humbled his neighborʼs isha; so thou shalt put away the rah from among you."
Devarim,22,25,"But if the ish find a na'arah hame'orasah (betrothed woman) in the sadeh, and the ish overpower her, and lie with her; then the ish only that lay with her shall die."
Devarim,22,26,"But unto the na'arah thou shalt do nothing; there is in the na'arah no chet mavet (sin worthy of death) ; for as when an ish riseth against his neighbor, and slayeth him, even so is this matter;"
Devarim,22,27,"For he found her in the sadeh, and the na'arah hame'orasah cried, and there was no moshia (savior) for her."
Devarim,22,28,"If an ish find a na'arah that is a betulah, which is not orasah (betrothed) , and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;"
Devarim,22,29,"Then the ish that lay with her shall give unto the avi hana'arah fifty [shekels] of kesef, and she shall be his isha; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his yamim."
Devarim,22,30,"An ish shall not take eshet aviv (his fatherʼs wife) , nor uncover his fatherʼs robe."
Devarim,23,1,"He that is wounded in the testicles, or hath a severed organ, shall not enter into the Kahal Hashem."
Devarim,23,2,A mamzer shall not enter into the Kahal Hashem ; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the Kahal Hashem.
Devarim,23,3,An Amoni or Moavi shall not enter into the Kahal Hashem ; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the Kahal Hashem ad olam;
Devarim,23,4,"Because they met you not with lechem and with mayim in the way, when ye came forth out of Mitzrayim; and because they hired against thee Balaam ben Be'or from Petor in Aram Naharayim, to curse thee."
Devarim,23,5,"Nevertheless Hashem Eloheicha would not give heed unto Balaam; but Hashem Eloheicha turned the kelalah into a brocha unto thee, because Hashem Eloheicha loved thee."
Devarim,23,6,Thou shalt not seek their shalom nor their tovat all thy yamim l'olam.
Devarim,23,7,Thou shalt not abhor an Edomi; for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor a Mitzri (an Egyptian) ; because thou wast a ger in his land.

Devarim,26,13,"Then thou shalt say before Hashem Eloheicha, I have brought away HaKodesh (the Holy) out of mine bais, and also have given them unto the Levi, and unto the ger, to the yatom (orphan) , and to the almanah, according to all Thy mitzvot which Thou hast commanded me; I have not transgressed Thy mitzvot, neither have I forgotten them."
Devarim,26,14,"I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away whatever thereof while I was tameh, nor given thereof for the dead; but I have given heed to the voice of Hashem Elohai, and have done according to all that Thou hast commanded me."
Devarim,26,15,"Look down from Thy me'on kadosh (holy dwelling place) , from Shomayim, and bless Thy people Yisroel, and ha'adamah which Thou hast given us, as Thou didst swear unto Avoteinu, Eretz zavat cholov udevash."
Devarim,26,16,"This day Hashem Eloheicha hath commanded thee to do these chukkim and mishpatim; thou shalt therefore be shomer over and do them with kol levavecha, and with kol nafshecha."

Devarim,28,51,"And he shall eat the pri of thy animals, and the pri of thy adamah, until thou be shmad; which also shall not leave thee either dagan, tirosh, or yitzhar, or the increase of thy livestock, or flocks of thy sheep, until it hath destroyed thee."
Devarim,28,52,"And it shall besiege thee in all thy she'arim, until thy high and fortified walls come down, wherein thou trusted, throughout all thy land; and it shall besiege thee in all thy she'arim throughout all thy land, which Hashem Eloheicha hath given thee."
Devarim,28,53,"And thou shalt eat the pri of thine own womb, the basar of thy banim and of thy banot, which Hashem Eloheicha hath given thee, in the matzor (siege) , and in the desperate straits, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee;"
Devarim,28,54,"So that the ish that is sensitive among you, and very refined, his eye shall be hostile toward his brother, and toward his eshet kheyk (wife of his bosom) , and toward the remnant of his banim which he shall leave;"
Devarim,28,55,"So that he will not give to any of them of the basar of his banim whom he shall eat; because he hath nothing left him in the matzor (siege) , and in the desperate straits, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy she'arim."
Devarim,28,56,"The sensitive and refined woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, she shall be hostile toward her ish kheyk (husband of her bosom) , and toward her ben, and toward her bat,"
Devarim,28,57,"And toward her afterbirth that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her banim which she shall bear; for she shall eat them for choser (want) of all things secretly in the matzor (siege) and desperate straits, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy she'arim."
Devarim,28,58,"If thou wilt not be shomer to do kol divrei hatorah hazot that are written in this sefer, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful Shem, HASHEM ELOHEICHA,"
Devarim,28,59,"Then Hashem will make thy makkot (plagues) extraordinary, and the makkot of thy zera, even makkot gedolot, and of long continuance, and cholayim ra'im (evil sicknesses) , and of long continuance."
Devarim,28,60,"Moreover He will bring upon thee all the diseases of Mitzrayim, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall have deveykus unto thee."
Devarim,28,61,"Also every choli (sickness) , and every makkah (plague) , which is not written in the sefer of this torah, them will Hashem bring upon thee, until thou be shmad."
Devarim,28,62,"And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the kokhavim of Shomayim for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of Hashem Eloheicha."
Devarim,28,63,"And it shall come to pass, that as Hashem rejoiced over you to do you good, to multiply you, so Hashem will rejoice over you to make you shmad, to bring you to nothing; and ye shall be plucked from off the adamah whither thou goest to possess it."
Devarim,28,64,"And Hashem shall scatter thee among kol ha'ammim, from the one end of ha'aretz even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve elohim acherim, which neither thou nor Avoteicha have known, even etz va'even."
Devarim,28,65,"And among these Goyim shalt thou find no mano'ach, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest; but Hashem shall give thee there a lev rogez (anxious heart) , and failing of eyes, and da'avon nefesh (suffering of soul);"
Devarim,28,66,"And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear lailah and yomam, and shalt have none assurance of thy life;"
Devarim,28,67,"In the boker thou shalt say, Would it were erev! And at erev thou shalt say, Would it were boker! For the pachad of thine lev wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see."
Devarim,28,68,"And Hashem shall bring thee into Mitzrayim again with oniyyot, by the way whereof I spoke unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again; and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for avadim and shefachot, and no ish shall buy you."
Devarim,29,1,"These are the devarei HaBrit, which Hashem commanded Moshe to cut with the Bnei Yisroel in Eretz Moav, besides the Brit which He cut with them in Chorev."
Devarim,29,2,"And Moshe called unto kol Yisroel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that Hashem did before your eyes in Eretz Mitzrayim unto Pharaoh, and unto all his avadim, and unto all his land;"
Devarim,29,3,"The massot hagedolot (great trials) which thine eyes have seen, the otot, and those mofetim hagedolim;"
Devarim,29,4,"V'lo natan Hashem lakhem lev lada'at v'einayim lirot v'ozna'im lishmoa ad hayom hazeh (Yet Hashem hath not given you a lev for da'as, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.)"
Devarim,29,5,"And I have led you arba'im shanim in the midbar; your clothes are not worn out upon you, and thy sandal is not worn out upon thy foot."
Devarim,29,6,"Ye have not eaten lechem, neither have ye drunk yayin or shechar; that ye might have da'as that Ani Hashem Eloheicha."
Devarim,29,7,"And when ye came unto this place, Sichon Melech Cheshbon, and Og Melech HaBashan, came out against us unto milchamah, and we defeated them:"
Devarim,29,8,"And we took their land, and gave it for a nachalah unto the Reuveni, and to the Gadi, and to the half tribe of Menasheh."
Devarim,29,9,"Therefore be shomer over the divrei HaBrit hazot, and do them, lema'an (in order that) ye may prosper in all that ye do."
Devarim,29,10,"Ye stand today all of you before Hashem Eloheichem; your rashei shvatim (heads of tribes) , your zekenim, and your shoterim, with kol Ish Yisroel,"
Devarim,29,11,"Your little ones, your nashim, and the ger that is in thy machaneh, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy mayim;"
Devarim,29,12,"That thou shouldest enter into Brit with Hashem Eloheicha, and into His alah (oath, imprecation) which Hashem Eloheicha cuts with thee today:"
Devarim,29,13,"In order that He may establish thee today for a people unto Himself, and that He may be unto thee Elohim, as He hath said unto thee, and as He hath sworn unto Avoteicha, to Avraham, to Yitzchak, and to Ya'akov."
Devarim,29,14,"Neither with you only do I cut this Brit and this alah (oath, imprecation);"
Devarim,29,15,"But with him that standeth here with us today before Hashem Eloheinu, and also with him that is not here with us today;"
Devarim,29,16,For ye know how we have dwelt in Eretz Mitzrayim; and how we came through the Goyim which ye passed by;
Devarim,29,17,"And ye have seen their shikkutzim (abominations) , and their gillulim (idols) , etz va'even, kesef and zahav, which were among them:"
Devarim,29,18,"Lest there should be among you ish, or isha, or mishpochah, or shevet, whose lev turneth away today from Hashem Eloheinu to go and serve the elohei hagoyim hahem (the g-ds of these Goyim) ; lest there should be among you a shoresh that beareth bitter poison and wormwood;"
Devarim,29,19,"And it come to pass, when he heareth the divrei haalah (words of this oath, imprecation) that he bless himself in his lev, saying, Shalom be with me, though I walk in the stubbornness of mine lev — thus bringing disaster on both the watered and the thirsty."
Devarim,29,20," Hashem will not spare him, but then the wrath of Hashem and His kina (jealousy) shall burn against that ish, and kol haalah (all the curses) that are written in this sefer shall fall upon him, and Hashem shall blot out shmo from under Shomayim."
Devarim,29,21,"And Hashem shall him separate out for disaster from all the Shivtei Yisroel, according to all the curses of HaBrit that are written in Sefer HaTorah Hazeh;"
Devarim,29,22,"So that the dor ha'acharon (later generation) to come of your banim that shall rise up after you, and the ger that shall come from an eretz rechokah (a far land) , shall say, when they see the makkot of that land, and the diseases which Hashem hath laid upon it;"
Devarim,29,23,"And that the whole land thereof is gofrit (sulfur) , and melach (salt) , and serefah (burning) , that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any esev groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Amora, Admah, and Tzevoyim, which Hashem overthrew in His anger, and in His wrath:"
Devarim,29,24,"Even Kol HaGoyim shall say, Why hath Hashem done thus unto this land? What meaneth the heat of this af hagadol (great anger)?"
Devarim,29,25,"Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the Brit Hashem Elohei Avotam, which He cut with them when He brought them forth out of Eretz Mitzrayim;"
Devarim,29,26,"For they went and served elohim acherim, and worshiped them, elohim whom they knew not, and whom He had not allotted unto them;"
Devarim,29,27,"And the Af Hashem was kindled against this land, to bring upon it kol hakelalah that are written in this sefer;"
Devarim,29,28,"And Hashem uprooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is yom hazeh."
Devarim,29,29,"The nistarot (secret things) belong unto Hashem Eloheinu: but the niglot (those things which are revealed) belong unto us and to baneinu ad olam, that we may do all the divrei haTorah hazot."
Devarim,30,1,"And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the brocha and the kelalah, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt cause them to return to thy heart among kol HaGoyim, whither Hashem Eloheicha hath driven thee,"
Devarim,30,2,"And shalt return unto Hashem Eloheicha, and shalt obey His voice according to all that I command thee today, thou and thy banim, bekhol levavcha uvekhol nafshecha;"
Devarim,30,3,"That then Hashem Eloheicha will bring you back from the golus, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from kol ha'amim whither Hashem Eloheicha hath dispersed thee."
Devarim,30,4,"If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of Shomayim, from thence will Hashem Eloheicha gather thee, and from thence will He bring thee back;"
Devarim,30,5,"And Hashem Eloheicha will bring thee into ha'aretz which Avoteicha possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and He will do thee good, and multiply thee above Avoteicha."
Devarim,30,6,"And Hashem Eloheicha will circumcise thine lev, and the lev of thy zera, to love Hashem Eloheicha bekhol levavcha uvekhol nafshecha; that thou mayest live."
Devarim,30,7,"And Hashem Eloheicha will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee."
Devarim,30,8,"And thou shalt return and obey the voice of Hashem , and do all His mitzvot which I command thee today."
Devarim,30,9,"And Hashem Eloheicha will make thee abound in every work of thine hand, in the pri of thy womb, and in the pri of thy animals, and in the pri of thy adamah, for tovah; for Hashem will again rejoice over thee for tov, as He rejoiced over Avoteicha;"
Devarim,30,10,"If thou shalt give heed unto the voice of Hashem Eloheicha, to be shomer over His mitzvot and His chukkot which are written in this sefer hatorah, for thou will turn unto Hashem Eloheicha bekhol levavcha uvekhol nafshecha."
Devarim,30,11,"For this mitzvah which I command thee today, it is not too hidden from thee, neither is it too distant."
Devarim,30,12,"It is not in Shomayim, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to Shomayim, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?"
Devarim,30,13,"Neither is it beyond the yam, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the yam for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?"
Devarim,30,14,"But the Davar is very near unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy lev, that thou mayest do it."
Devarim,30,15,"See, I have set before thee today HaChayyim and HaTov, and Mavet and Rah;"
Devarim,30,16,"In that I command thee today to love Hashem Eloheicha, to walk in His ways, and to be shomer over His mitzvot and His chukkot and His mishpatim, that thou mayest live and multiply; and Hashem Eloheicha shall bless thee in ha'aretz whither thou goest to possess it."
Devarim,30,17,"But if thine lev turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship elohim acherim, and serve them;"
Devarim,30,18,"I announce unto you today, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your yamim upon ha'adamah, whither thou passest over Yarden to go to possess it."
Devarim,30,19,"I call Shomayim and Ha'Aretz to record today as witnesses against you, that I have set before you HaChayyim and HaMavet, HaBrocha and HaKelalah; therefore choose Chayyim, that both thou and thy zera may live;"
Devarim,30,20,"That thou mayest love Hashem Eloheicha, and that thou mayest obey His voice, and that thou mayest have deveykus unto Him: for He is Chayyeicha (your life) , and the orech yameicha (length of your days) ; that thou mayest dwell in ha'adamah which Hashem swore unto Avoteicha, to Avraham, to Yitzchak, and to Ya'akov, to give them."
Devarim,31,1,And Moshe went and spoke these devarim unto kol Yisroel.
Devarim,31,2,"And he said unto them, I am me'ah v'esrim shanah today; I can no more go out and come in; also Hashem hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Yarden."
Devarim,31,3," Hashem Eloheicha, He will go over before thee, and He will make shmad these Goyim from before thee, and thou shalt dispossess them; and Yehoshua (see Neh 8:17 for Aramaic form, Yeshua) , he shall go over before thee, as Hashem hath said."
Devarim,31,4,"And Hashem shall do unto them as He did to Sichon and to Og, melachim of the Emori, and unto the land of them, whom He made shmad."
Devarim,31,5,"And Hashem shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto kol hamitzvot which I have commanded you."
Devarim,31,6,"Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of their faces; for Hashem Eloheicha, He it is that doth go with thee; He will not fail thee, nor abandon thee."
Devarim,31,7,"And Moshe called unto Yehoshua, and said unto him in the sight of kol Yisroel, Chazak! (be strong) and of a good courage; for thou must go with this people unto Ha'Aretz which Hashem hath sworn unto their avot to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it."
Devarim,31,8,"And Hashem , He it is that doth go before thee; He will be with thee, He will not fail thee, neither abandon thee: fear not, neither be dismayed."
Devarim,31,9,"And Moshe wrote this torah, and delivered it unto the kohanim, the Bnei Levi, which bore the Aron Brit Hashem and unto kol Ziknei Yisroel."
Devarim,31,10,"And Moshe commanded them, saying, At the end of every shevah shanim, in the mo'ed (appointed time) of the shnat hashemittah (year of release) , in Chag HaSukkot,"
Devarim,31,11,"When kol Yisroel is come to appear before Hashem Eloheicha in the place which He shall choose, thou shalt read this torah before kol Yisroel in their hearing."
Devarim,31,12,"Gather the people together, anashim and nashim, and banim, and ger that is within thy she'arim, in order that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Hashem Eloheichem, and be shomer to do kol divrei hatorah hazot;"
Devarim,31,13,"And that their banim, which have not known anything, may hear, and learn to fear Hashem Eloheichem, as long as ye live in ha'adamah whither ye go over Yarden to possess it."
Devarim,31,14,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Behold, thy yamim approach that thou must die; call Yehoshua, and present yourselves in the Ohel Mo'ed, that I may give him a charge. And Moshe and Yehoshua went, and presented themselves in the Ohel Mo'ed."
Devarim,31,15,And Hashem appeared in the Ohel in an ammud anan (pillar of cloud) ; and the ammud anan stood over the petach (entrance) of the Ohel.
Devarim,31,16,"And Hashem said unto Moshe, Behold, thou shalt sleep with Avoteicha; and this people will rise up, and play the harlot going after the elohei nekhar ha'aretz (g-ds of the foreigners of the land) , whither they go to be among them, and will forsake Me, and break My Brit which I have cut them."
Devarim,31,17,"Then My anger shall be kindled against them in Yom Hahu, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured, and ra'ot rabbot (many evils) and tzarot (troubles) shall befall them; so that they will say in Yom Hahu, Are not these evils come upon us, because Elohai is not among us?"
Devarim,31,18,"And I will surely hide My face in Yom Hahu for kol hara'ah which they shall have done, in that they are turned unto elohim acherim."
Devarim,31,19,"Now therefore write ye this shirah for you, and teach it the Bnei Yisroel; put it in their mouths, in order that this shirah may be an ed (witness) for Me against the Bnei Yisroel."
Devarim,31,20,"For when I shall have brought them into ha'adamah which I swore unto Avotav (their fathers) , zavat cholov u'devash (that floweth with milk and honey) ; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat; then will they turn unto elohim acherim, and serve them, and provoke Me, and break My Brit."
Devarim,31,21,"And it shall come to pass, when ra'ot rabbot and tzarot are befallen them, that this shirah shall testify against them as an ed (witness) ; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their zera; for I know their yetzer (inclination) in which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into ha'aretz which I swore."
Devarim,31,22,"Moshe therefore wrote this shirah on that day, and taught it the Bnei Yisroel."
Devarim,31,23,"And he gave Yehoshua ben Nun a charge, and said, Chazak! And of a good courage; for thou shalt bring the Bnei Yisroel into Ha'Aretz which I swore unto them; and I will be with thee."
Devarim,31,24,"And it came to pass, when Moshe had made an end of writing the divrei HaTorah hazot in a sefer, until they were finished,"
Devarim,31,25,"That Moshe commanded the Levi'im, which bore the Aron Brit Hashem , saying,"
Devarim,31,26,"Take this sefer haTorah, and put it at the side of the Aron Brit Hashem Eloheichem, that it may be there for an ed (witness) against thee."
Devarim,31,27,"For I know thy meri (rebellion) , and thy oref hakasheh (stiff neck) ; behold, while I am yet alive with you today, ye have been mamrim (rebellious) against Hashem ; and how much more after my death!"
Devarim,31,28,"Gather unto me kol ziknei shvatim of you, and your shoterim, that I may speak these devarim in their hearing, and call Shomayim and Ha'Aretz to record as witnesses against them."
Devarim,31,29,"For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from HaDerech which I have commanded you; and hara'ah will befall you in the acharim hayamim; because ye will do rah (evil) in the sight of Hashem , to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands."
Devarim,31,30,"And Moshe spoke in the ears of kol Kahal Yisroel the divrei hashirah hazot (words of this song) , until they were ended."
Devarim,32,1,"Give ear, O Shomayim, and I will speak; and hear, O Ha'Aretz, the words of my mouth."
Devarim,32,2,"My teaching shall drop as the matar, my speech shall distil as the tal, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the esev;"
Devarim,32,3,Because I will publish the Shem of Hashem ; ascribe ye greatness unto Eloheinu.
Devarim,32,4,"He is the Tzur, His po'al is tamim; for all His ways are mishpat; El Emunah and without avel (iniquity) , tzaddik and yashar is He."
Devarim,32,5,"They have corrupted themselves, their mum is not His; the defect is in His banim; a dor ikesh u'petaltol (a perverse and crooked generation)."
Devarim,32,6,"Do ye thus repay Hashem , O foolish people without chacham? Is not He Avicha that hath bought thee? Hath He not made thee, and established thee?"
Devarim,32,7,"Remember the yemot olam, consider shenot dor v'dor: ask Avicha, and he will show thee; thy zekenim, and they will tell thee."
Devarim,32,8,"When HaElyon divided to the Goyim their nachalah, when He separated the Bnei Adam, He set the gevulot (borders) of the people according to the number of the Bnei Yisroel."
Devarim,32,9,For Hashem ʼs chelek is His people; Ya'akov is the chevel (allotment) of His nachalah.
Devarim,32,10,"He found him in an eretz midbar, and in a barren and howling wilderness; He encircled him, He granted him discernment, He preserved him as the pupil of His eye."
Devarim,32,11,"As a nesher stirreth up her ken (nest) , fluttereth over her young, spreadeth her wings, taketh them up, beareth them on her wings,"
Devarim,32,12,"So Hashem alone did lead him, and there was no el nekhar (strange g-d) with him."
Devarim,32,13,"He made him ride on the high places of Eretz, that he might eat the tenuvot sadeh (increase of the fields) ; and He made to suckle him devash out of the rock, and shemen out of the flinty rock;"
Devarim,32,14,"Butter of cattle, and cholov tzon, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with chittah (wheat) as fat as kidneys; and thou didst drink the pure dahm of the grape."
Devarim,32,15,"But Yeshurun grew fat, and kicked; thou art grown fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook G-d which made him, and lightly esteemed the Tzur of his Yeshu'ah (Salvation)."
Devarim,32,16,"They provoked Him to jealousy with zarim (foreign g-ds) , with to'evot (abominations) provoked they Him to anger."
Devarim,32,17,"They sacrificed unto shedim (demons) , not to G-d; to elohim whom they knew not, to chadashim (new g-ds) , new arrivals, whom Avoteichem feared not."
Devarim,32,18,"Of the Tzur that fathered thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten El that formed thee."
Devarim,32,19,"And when Hashem saw it, He spurned them, because of the provoking of His banim, and of His banot."
Devarim,32,20,"And He said, I will hide My face from them, I will see what their end shall be; for they are a very perverse generation, banim in whom is no faithfulness."
Devarim,32,21,"They have moved Me to jealousy with that which is lo El (not G-d) , they have provoked Me to anger with their vanities; and I will move them to jealousy with those which are lo Am (a non-people) ; I will provoke them to anger with a goy naval (foolish, senseless nation)."
Devarim,32,22,"For an eish is kindled in Mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest Sheol, and shall devour Eretz and her increase, and set on fire the foundations of harim."
Devarim,32,23,I will heap disasters upon them; I will spend Mine khitzim (arrows) upon them.
Devarim,32,24,"They shall be burned with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction; I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the venom of serpents of the aphar (dust)."
Devarim,32,25,"The cherev without, and terror within, shall destroy both the bochur and the betulah, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs."
Devarim,32,26,"I said, I will dash them in pieces, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men;"
Devarim,32,27,"Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should misinterpret, and lest they should say, Our hand is triumphant, and Hashem hath not done all this."
Devarim,32,28,"For they are a goy (nation) void of sense, neither is there any seichel in them."
Devarim,32,29,"O that they were wise, that they had seichel, that they would consider their acharit (latter end, future)!"
Devarim,32,30,"How should echad chase an elef (thousand) , and shnayim (two) put ten thousand to flight, except their tzur had sold them, and Hashem had shut them up?"
Devarim,32,31,"For their tzur is not like Tzureinu, even our enemies themselves being conceders."
Devarim,32,32,"For their gefen is of the gefen of Sodom, and of the fields of Amora (Gomorrah) ; their grapes are grapes of poison, their clusters are bitter;"
Devarim,32,33,"Their yayin is the venom of serpents, and the deadly poison of asps."
Devarim,32,34,"Is not this laid up in store with Me, and sealed up among My otzrot (treasures)?"
Devarim,32,35,"To Me belongeth nakam (vengeance) and recompence; their foot shall slip in due time; for the Yom of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste."
Devarim,32,36,"For Hashem shall judge His people, and relent for His avadim, when He seeth that their power is gone, and there is none left, slave or free."
Devarim,32,37,"And He shall say, Where are their elohim, their tzur in whom they trusted,"
Devarim,32,38,"Which did eat the fat of their zevakhim (sacrifices) , and drank the yayin of their nesakhim (drink offerings) ? Let them rise up and help you, and be your shelter."
Devarim,32,39,"See now that I, even I, am He, and there is no elohim besides Me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; neither is there any that can deliver out of My hand."
Devarim,32,40,"For I lift up My hand to Shomayim, and say, Chai Anochi l'Olam (I live forever)."
Devarim,32,41,"If I sharpen My glittering cherev, and Mine hand take hold on mishpat; I will render nakam (vengeance) to Mine enemies, and will reward them that hate Me."
Devarim,32,42,"I will make Mine khitzim (arrows) drunk with dahm, and My cherev shall devour basar; and that with the dahm of the slain and of the captives, from the head of leaders of the foe."
Devarim,32,43,"Rejoice, O ye Goyim, with His people: for He will avenge the dahm of His avadim, and will render nakam (vengeance) to His adversaries, and will make kapporah for the land of His people."
Devarim,32,44,"And Moshe came and spoke kol divre hashirah in the hearing of the people, he, and Hoshea ben Nun."
Devarim,32,45,And Moshe made an end of speaking all these devarim to kol Yisroel;
Devarim,32,46,"And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the devarim which I testify among you today, which ye shall command your banim to be shomer to do, kol divrei hatorah hazot."
Devarim,32,47,"For it is not an idle thing for you; because it is Chayyeichem (your life) ; and through this thing ye shall prolong your yamim in ha'adamah, whither ye go over Yarden to possess it."
Devarim,32,48,"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe that very same day, saying,"
Devarim,32,49,"Get thee up into this mountain range Avarim, unto Mt Nevo, which is in Eretz Moav, that is opposite Yericho; and view Eretz Kena'an, which I give unto the Bnei Yisroel for a possession;"
Devarim,32,50,"And in the mount whither thou goest up ye will die, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aharon thy brother died in Mt Hor, and was gathered unto his people;"
Devarim,32,51,"Because you trespassed against Me among the Bnei Yisroel at the waters of Merivat-Kadesh, in the midbar of Tzin; because lo kiddashtem (not ye upheld as holy) Me in the midst of the Bnei Yisroel."
Devarim,32,52,Therefore from a distance thou shalt see ha'aretz; but thou shalt not enter thither into ha'aretz which I give the Bnei Yisroel.
Devarim,33,1,"And this is the brocha, wherewith Moshe the Ish HaElohim blessed the Bnei Yisroel before moto (his death)."
