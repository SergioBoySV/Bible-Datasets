1 Kefa,1,1,"Shim'on Kefa a Shliach of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua to HaBechirim (the Chosen ones), to the Exiled ones of the Golus, Sojourners living as aliens in the Diaspora, scattered in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,"
1 Kefa,1,2,"To HaBechirim (the Chosen ones) according to the yedi'ah mukdemet (foreknowledge) of Elohim Avinu, the ones set apart as Kedoshim by the Ruach Hakodesh, resulting in mishma'at (obedience) to the Moshiach and resulting in hazzayat HaDahm (sprinkling of the Blood) of Moshiach Yehoshua. May Chen v'Chesed Hashem and Shalom Hashem abound to all of you!"
1 Kefa,1,3,"Baruch Hashem , HaElohim Avi of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua! By his great rachamim (mercy) we have been born anew to a tikvah chayyah (living hope) through the Techiyas Yehoshua from HaMesim (the dead ones)."
1 Kefa,1,4,"We have also been born anew to a nachalah (inheritance) that is without shachat (corruption, decay) , undefiled and unfading, having been preserved in Shomayim for you,"
1 Kefa,1,5,"The ones by the koach of Hashem being guarded through Emunah (Faith) for Yeshu'at Eloheinu (the Salvation of our G-d) , which is ready to be revealed at the Ketz Hayamim (End of Days)."
1 Kefa,1,6,"In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have to suffer in various masot (trials, temptations),"
1 Kefa,1,7,"That the genuineness of your Emunah, much more valuable than gold which though perishable is tested by Eish (Fire) , may be found to the tehillah (praise) and the kavod (glory) and the tiferet (splendor) at the Hisgalus (Revelation, Apocalypse) of Moshiach Yehoshua."
1 Kefa,1,8,"He is the one for whom you have ahavah, even though you have not seen him. Though you do not now see him, you have emunah in him and rejoice with simcha inexpressible and full of kavod,"
1 Kefa,1,9,"Obtaining the maskana (outcome) of your Emunah, the Yeshu'at Eloheynu of your nefashot (souls)."
1 Kefa,1,10,"The Nevi'im, who prophesied of the Chen v'Chesed Hashem that was to come to you, searched and inquired about this Yeshu'at Eloheynu."
1 Kefa,1,11,"The Nevi'im were searching for what zman (time) or what context of occasion the Ruach of Moshiach in them was pointing to, when predicting the Chevlei Moshiach and HaKavod to follow."
1 Kefa,1,12,"The hisgalus (revelation) came to the Nevi'im that the avodas hakodesh ministry they were rendering was not to themselves, but to you, when they spoke of the things announced to you through the Mevaserim (Messianic Darshanim, Maggidim) of the Besuras HaGeulah by the Ruach Hakodesh sent from Shomayim, the very things even malachim desire to look into."
1 Kefa,1,13,"Therefore, tighten the “readiness” gartel of your mind, a mind that is one of kibush hayetzer (self-control) . Set your tikvah completely on the Chen v'Chesed Hashem that is being brought to you, at the Hisgalus (Revelation, Apocalypse) of Moshiach Yehoshua."
1 Kefa,1,14,"As Bnei Mishma'at (Children of Obedience) , not conforming yourselves to your former ta'avot (lusts) , when you lacked da'as (personal, saving knowledge),"
1 Kefa,1,15,"But, als (since) the One who bestows on you the kri'ah (calling) is KADOSH HU, so also yourselves become Kedoshim in hitnahagut (conduct),"
1 Kefa,1,16,"Because it says in the Torah, KEDOSHIM TIH'YU KI KADOSH ANI (You must be holy ones for I am holy)."
1 Kefa,1,17,"And if you call upon as “Avinu” the One who is the impartial Shofet (Shofet kol ha'aretz) of each man L'ISH K'MA'ASEIHU (To each according to his deeds) , then conduct yourself with yirat Shomayim during your time in the Golus of the Olam Hazeh,"
1 Kefa,1,18,Having da'as that the padut nafsheynu (redemption ransom of our souls) was not with perishable things such as silver or gold when your Geulah (Redemption) was purchased from the Derech HaHevel (empty way of life) handed down to you from your Avot.
1 Kefa,1,19,"No, it was the precious DAHM as of a SEH TAMIM U'MUM (lamb unblemished and unspotted) , the DAHM of Moshiach"
1 Kefa,1,20,"Who, on the one hand, having been foreknown lifnei hivvased tevel (before the foundation of the world) , but, on the other hand, having been manifested at the Ketz Hayamim (End of Days) because of you."
1 Kefa,1,21,"Through him you have emunah in Hashem , the One who brought forth the Techiyas HaMoshiach from HaMesim (the dead ones) and gave him Kavod. And so your emunah and your tikvah are in Hashem."
1 Kefa,1,22,"Having purified your nefashot (souls) by mishma'at (obedience) to HaEmes, resulting in ahavah shel achvah (brotherly love) without tzevi'ut (hypocrisy) , have fervent ahavah (agape) for one another, from a lev tahor."
1 Kefa,1,23,"You have been given a new birth, not from perishable zerah (seed) , but zerah that is without shachat (corruption) , through the Dvar Hashem who is Chai v'Nitzav l'Olam (living and remaining firm forever)."
1 Kefa,1,24,"For, All flesh is grass and all of [mankindʼs] glory is like the flower: the grass withers, the flower falls,"
1 Kefa,1,25,But the Word of our G-d stands forever. And this is the Dvar proclaimed to you as the Besuras HaGeulah [in Moshiach].
1 Kefa,2,1,"Therefore, having put away all rishus (malice) , all remiyah (guile, fraud, deceit) and tzevi'ut (hypocrisy) and kin'ah (envy) and all lashon hora,"
1 Kefa,2,2,"As new born olalim (infants) , desire the pure cholov ruchani (spiritual milk) , that by it you may grow into Yeshu'at Eloheynu,"
1 Kefa,2,3,Now that you have tasted KI TOV Hashem (that the L-rd is good).
1 Kefa,2,4,"Come to him, to that “Even Chayyah” (Living Stone) , CHADAL ISHIM (rejected by men) but BECHIR (Chosen), and precious in the sight of Hashem."
1 Kefa,2,5,"You also, like avanim chayyot (living stones), are being built up for a Bayit Ruchani (a Spiritual Beis, House) for a kehunnat kodesh (holy priesthood) to offer up zivchei ruach (sacrifices of the spirit) acceptable to Hashem through Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua."
1 Kefa,2,6,"For it stands written in the Kitvei HaKodesh, HINENI YISSAD B'TZIYON EVEN PINNAT YIKRAT (Behold, I place in Zion a precious corner stone), chosen, and HAMMA'AMIN LO YACHISH (the one believing [on Moshiach] never will be dismayed, ashamed)."
1 Kefa,2,7,"Therefore, to you who are the ma'aminim this EVEN (Stone) is YIKRAT (precious), but to the Apikorosim (Unbelievers) : EVEN MA'ASU HABONIM HAY'TAH LEROSH PINAH (The Stone which the ones building rejected became the head of the corner)."
1 Kefa,2,8,And EVEN NEGEF U'L'TZUR MICHSHOL (a stone for stumbling over and a rock for falling over). They stumble because they have no mishma'at (obedience) to the Dvar Hashem which is also what they were appointed for.
1 Kefa,2,9,"But you are an AM NIVCHAR (a chosen people ), a MAMLECHET KOHANIM (a kingdom of priests, royal priests), a GOY KADOSH (a holy nation), an AM SEGULLAH (a people of treasured possession), for this purpose: that you may declare the wondrous deeds of the One who gave you the kri'ah (calling) and summoned you out of choshech into his marvelous ohr."
1 Kefa,2,10,"You, who once were LO AMI (not My people) but now AMI ATAH (My people you are), the AM Hashem (the people of G-d) , the ones having not received rachamim, but now having received rachamim."
1 Kefa,2,11,"Chaverim, I say “Chazak!” (Be Strong) to you as aliens and exiles, exhorting you to abstain from fleshly ta'avot (lusts) which make milchamah (war) against the neshamah."
1 Kefa,2,12,"Let your hitnahagut (conduct) among the Goyim show feste (excellent) midas chasidus (trait of piety) that, wherein they speak against you as anshei resha (men of wickedness) , by observing your ma'asim tovim they may glorify Hashem in the YOM PEKUDDAH (Day of Visitation, Reckoning)."
1 Kefa,2,13,"Submit to every created human memshalah (governing authority) because of Hashem , whether to a Melech (King) as being HaRosh,"
1 Kefa,2,14,"Or to moshelim (governors) as being sent by Hashem for the purpose of nakam (vengeance) on anshei resha (men of wickedness) , but for the purpose of shevach (praise, commendation) on anshei tzedek."
1 Kefa,2,15,"For it is the ratzon Hashem (the will of G-d) that you, by acting as anshei tzedek, may silence the lack of da'as (knowledge) of the kesilim (the foolish people)."
1 Kefa,2,16,"As Avadim (Servants) of Hashem , live as Bnei Chorin (Sons of Freedom, Freedmen) ; yet do not use your cherut (freedom) as a cloak for concealing ra'ah (evil)."
1 Kefa,2,17,"Have kavod (respect, honor) toward kol Bnei Adam; have ahavah (agape) toward HaAchim (The Brotherhood of the Messianic Chavurah) ; have yirat Shomayim toward Hashem, have kavod to HaMelech."
1 Kefa,2,18,"Avadim, be submitting in kol yir'ah (all fear) to your adonim (masters) , not only to the good and eidele (gentle) adonim, but also to the hard sarei misim (task-masters)."
1 Kefa,2,19,"For this is worthy of shevach (praise, commendation) if, because of a consciousness of Hashem , anyone bears up under tzoros (troubles) while suffering unjustly."
1 Kefa,2,20,"For what shevach (praise) is it if, after committing chatta'im (sins) and being beaten, you endure? But if being osei tzedek (doers of what is right) and suffering, then you endure, this is worthy of shevach before Hashem."
1 Kefa,2,21,"It was for this tachlis (purpose) [of your being osei tzedek and suffering] that you were given your kri'ah (calling) , because also Moshiach suffered on behalf of you, leaving you a mofet (example) , that you should follow be'ikvot Moshiach (in the steps of Moshiach),"
1 Kefa,2,22,Who was beli chet (without sin) V'LO MIRMAH BEFIV (and no deceit was in his mouth);
1 Kefa,2,23,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, who, being reviled, did not retaliate; suffering, he did not utter iyumim (threats) , but handed himself over, entrusting himself to the Shofet Tzedek (Righteous Judge);"
1 Kefa,2,24,"Moshiach, who himself NASAH (bore, carried away) ES PEYSHA'EINU (our transgressions, our sins) in geviyyato on HAETZ that, having become niftarim (deceased ones) to chattoteinu, we might become Kol Chai (all living) to Tzidkanut (Righteousness) ; UVACHAVURATO NIRPA LANU (by whose wounds you were healed)."
1 Kefa,2,25,"For you were KULLANU KA'TZON TA'INU (all of us like sheep we went astray), for you were as sheep being led astray, but you made teshuva now to the Ro'eh and Mashgiach (Overseer) of your nefashot (souls)."
1 Kefa,3,1,"Nashim (wives) , submit similarly to your own ba'alim (husbands) , that even if any anashim lack mishma'at (obedience) to the Dvar Hashem , they may be won without the Dvar through the hitnahagut (conduct) of their nashim,"
1 Kefa,3,2,When they see your yirat Shomayim and your midas chasidus (quality of piety).
1 Kefa,3,3,"Do not let your adornment be outward, with coiffures and with wearing gold or fine apparel,"
1 Kefa,3,4,"But let your adornment be nistar (hidden) , adornment shebalev (inwardly) by the imperishable adorning of the quiet ruach anavah (humble spirit) , which is before Hashem of great worth."
1 Kefa,3,5,"For so formerly also the nashim hakedoshot (holy women) whose tikvah was in Hashem were adorning themselves, submitting themselves to their own ba'alim."
1 Kefa,3,6,"Just so, Sarah submitted in mishma'at (obedience) to Avraham Avinu, calling him ADONI. You nashim became Sarahʼs banot (daughters) , if you act as nashei tzedek and you fear no intimidation."
1 Kefa,3,7,"Likewise, Ba'alim (Husbands) , dwell with them according to the da'as of the isha as a k'li rach (weaker vessel) , showing them kavod as also being yoreshim together of the mattanah (gift) of the Chen v'Chesed HaChayyim, so that your tefillos will not be hindered."
1 Kefa,3,8,"Now, to say over, all of you be an agudah (bound together union) in your thinking, have achdus, be sympathetic, having ahavah (agape) for the Achim b'Moshiach, being tender-hearted men of mercy v'shiflei ruach (and lowly of spirit),"
1 Kefa,3,9,"Not rendering ra'ah for ra'ah or lashon hora for lashon hora, but, fahkert (on the contrary) , rendering a bracha (blessing) , because to this tachlis (purpose) you were given your kri'ah (calling) , that you may inherit a bracha (blessing)."
1 Kefa,3,10,HAISH HECHAFETZ CHAYYIM OHEV YAMIM LIROT TOV (For the one wanting to love life and to see good days) NETZOR L'SHONECHA MERAH U'SFATECHA MIDABER MIRMAH (Let him stop his tongue from speaking lashon hora and his lips from speaking remiyah).
1 Kefa,3,11,"“Let him turn away from resha and let him do that which is good, let him seek shalom and pursue it;”"
1 Kefa,3,12,EINEI ADONOI EL TZADDIKIM V'AZNAV EL SHAV'ATAM (Because the tzaddikim are before the eyes of Hashem and His ears are open to their tefillos) . P'NEI ADONOI B'OSEI RAH L'HACHRIT ME'ARETZ ZICHRAM (But the face of the L-rd is against the ones doing evil to cut off their memory from the earth).
1 Kefa,3,13,And who is the one harming you if you have kana'ut (zeal) for HaTov (The Good)?
1 Kefa,3,14,"But if indeed you should suffer tzoros because of Tzidkat Hashem , you are blessed and happy. But do not fear their pachad (terror) , neither be troubled."
1 Kefa,3,15,"But reverence in your levavot Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach as Adoneinu, prepared always for a hitstaddekut (an apologetic defense) to everyone coming to you with a she'elah (question) , ready with a word concerning the tikvah in you,"
1 Kefa,3,16,"But with anavah (meekness) and yirat Shomayim, having a clear matzpun (conscience), so that, when you are maligned by lashon hora, your abusers may be humiliated by your midas chasidus in Moshiach."
1 Kefa,3,17,"For im yirtzeh Hashem (if the L-rd wills) , it is better to suffer tzoros for doing mitzvot than for doing ra'ah."
1 Kefa,3,18,"Because, indeed, Moshiach suffered once on behalf of chatta'im (sins) , a Tzaddik (righteous one) on behalf of the chote'im (unrighteous ones, sinners) , that he might bring you to Hashem he, having been in the basar put to death, yet, in the Ruach Hakodesh, having been made alive;"
1 Kefa,3,19,"In which also to the ruchot (spirits) now in mishmar (prison) , having gone, Moshiach made the hachrazah (proclamation, kerygma)"
1 Kefa,3,20,"To ones without mishma'at (obedience) back then when the savlanut (patience) of Hashem was waiting, in the days of Noach, while the Teva (Ark) was being prepared, in which a few, that is shemoneh nefashot (eight souls) , were delivered through that mabbulʼs mikveh mayim;"
1 Kefa,3,21,"And Moshiachʼs tevilah in the mikveh mayim, which this mabbul prefigures, now delivers you, not by means of the removal of filth from the basar, but through the hitchaiy'vut (pledge) of a clean matzpun toward Hashem , through the Techiyas HaMoshiach Yehoshua,"
1 Kefa,3,22,"Who is at the right hand of Hashem , having gone into Shomayim, with malachim and rashuyot (authorities) and gevurot under his feet."
1 Kefa,4,1,"Therefore, als (since) Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach underwent bodily yissurim (sufferings), also you arm yourselves with the same way of thinking as Moshiach, because the one having suffered in the basar (flesh) has finished with chet (sin),"
1 Kefa,4,2,"So as no longer to live the remaining time of the Olam Hazeh in the basar, in the ta'avot Bnei Adam (lusts of men) , but in the ratzon Hashem (will of G-d)."
1 Kefa,4,3,"For you have already spent sufficient time (time already gone by) in the Olam Hazeh participating in the ta'avot (lusts) of the Goyim, walking in darchei zimah (the ways of licentiousness) , ta'avot (lusts) , shichrut (drunkenness) , orgiastic drinking mesibot (parties) , and unlawful avodas elilim (idolatry)."
1 Kefa,4,4,"The Goyim think it strange that you are not running with them into the same mabbul (flood) of dissipation, and so they blaspheme and commit Chillul Hashem."
1 Kefa,4,5,But they will give an account to the One being ready to take his moshav (seat) as the Shofet of HaChayyim v'HaMesim (the Living and the Dead).
1 Kefa,4,6,"For, indeed, this is the reason that the Besuras HaGeulah was preached to the mesim (dead ones), that, though judged in the basar according to men, they might live according to G-d in the spirit."
1 Kefa,4,7,"The Ketz (End) of all things now has drawn near. Let your thinking be one of zililut da'as (sober-mindedness) , therefore, and exercise kibush hayetzer (self-control) , for the sake of your tefillos."
1 Kefa,4,8,"Above all else, have fervent ahavah among yourselves, for AHAVAH KOL PEYSHA'IM T'CHASSEH (love covers all wrongs)."
1 Kefa,4,9,"Practice hachnosas orchim (hospitality) with one another without kevetching,"
1 Kefa,4,10,"Each one according as he received a mattanah (gift) , as k'lei kodesh ministering to one another, mefakkechim tovim (good stewards, supervisors) of the varied Chen v'Chesed Hashem."
1 Kefa,4,11,"If anyone speaks, let it be as though it were the oracles of Hashem ; if anyone ministers, let it be as by the chozek (strength) which Hashem supplies, that in all things Hashem may be glorified through Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua. Lo HaKavod V'HaOz L'Olemei Olamim. Omein (To whom be the glory and the power into the ages of the ages. Omein.)"
1 Kefa,4,12,"Chaverim, do not be surprised at the masah (trial) of eish (fire) among you coming for you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you."
1 Kefa,4,13,"But in so far as you share in the yissurim (sufferings) of Moshiach, in the Chevlei HaMoshiach, be glad that also in the Hisgalus (Revelation, Apocalypse) of his Kavod, you may have simcha and sasson."
1 Kefa,4,14,"If you are reproached for the Shem HaMoshiach, ashrei (happy, blessed) are you, because the Ruach of Kavod and of Hashem rests upon you."
1 Kefa,4,15,Let not any of you suffer as a rotzeach (murderer) or a ganav (thief) or an oseh ra'ah (an evil doer) or as one who is mitarev (meddlesome).
1 Kefa,4,16,"But if any one of you suffers as a ma'amin b'Moshiach (believer in Moshiach) , let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify Hashem by this Name."
1 Kefa,4,17,"Because the time has come to begin the Mishpat from the Beis Hashem ; and if the Mishpat begins with us, what will be the toitzaa (outcome) of the ones without mishma'at (obedience) to the Besuras HaGeulah of Hashem?"
1 Kefa,4,18,"And if indeed the Tzaddik is saved with difficulty, where will appear the man without chasidus [in Moshiach], the rashah and the choteh?"
1 Kefa,4,19,"Therefore, the ones undergoing sevalot (sufferings, yissurim) according to the ratzon Hashem , let them commit their nefashot to a trustworthy Yotzer (Creator) while they continue to do ma'asim tovim."
1 Kefa,5,1,"Therefore, I give this word of chozek to the Zekenim (Elders) among you, I, as a fellow Zaken (Elder) and as an Eidus (Witness) of the sevalot (sufferings) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and also as a partaker of the Kavod about to be unveiled:"
1 Kefa,5,2,"Exercise the avodas hakodesh ministry of Ro'eh (Shepherd) on behalf of the Eder Hashem (Flock of G-d) among you, serving as Mashgichim Ruchaniyim (Spiritual Overseers) , not unwillingly, for the sake of dishonest gelt, but willingly, eagerly, in conformity with Hashem,"
1 Kefa,5,3,"Not as domineering the ones assigned by Hashem to your oversight, but being a mofet (example) for the tzon (flock)."
1 Kefa,5,4,"After the Sar HaRo'im (Chief of Shepherds) has been manifested, you will receive the unfading Ateret HaKavod (Crown of Glory)."
1 Kefa,5,5,"Likewise, bochrim (young men) , be submissive to the Zekenim (Elders) and clothe yourselves in the kaftan of anavah (humility) toward one another, because IM LALETZIM HU YALITZ V'LA'ANAYIM YITEN CHEN (Indeed Hashem scorns the scorners, but gives grace to the humble)."
1 Kefa,5,6,"Therefore, be humbled under the mighty hand of Hashem , that you may be exalted in due time."
1 Kefa,5,7,"HASHLECH AL ADONOI Y'HAVECHA V'HU Y'CHALKELECHA (Cast your care on Hashem and He will sustain you) , because Hashem cares and is concerned about you."
1 Kefa,5,8,"Be shomer in zililut da'as (sober-mindedness) . Your adversary HaSatan [Samma'el], prowls around like a roaring arye (lion) , seeking whom to swallow."
1 Kefa,5,9,"Oppose him, firm in emunah, knowing that in the Olam Hazeh, the same Chevlei [Moshiach] are to be laid upon HaAchim b'Moshiach."
1 Kefa,5,10,"Now the Elohei Kol Chen v'Chesed (the G-d of all Grace) , the one having bestowed upon you the kri'ah (calling) into His eternal kavod in Moshiach Yehoshua, after you have suffered tzoros for a little while, will Himself restore, confirm, strengthen and establish you."
1 Kefa,5,11,Lo HaKavod V'HaOz L'Olemei Olamim. Omein.
1 Kefa,5,12,"To you, through Sila HaAch HaNe'eman (the Faithful Brother in Moshiach) , as such I regard him, I have written you briefly, a dvar chizzuk, encouraging you and giving edut (testimony) that this is the true Chen v'Chesed Hashem in which you stand."
1 Kefa,5,13,"Drishat Shalom to you from your coequal Nivcharah (Chosen One) , she in Bavel. Drishat Shalom also from Markos, beni."
1 Kefa,5,14,"Greet one another with a neshikat ahavah (kiss of agape) . Drishat Shalom to all of you, the ones in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
