3 Yochanan,1,1,"From the Zaken (Elder) . To Gaius HaAhuv (Gaius the beloved) , for whom I have ahavah (agape) b'Emes."
3 Yochanan,1,2,"Chaver, it is my tefillah that all may be hatzlocha (successful) with you, and that you may be shalem b'guf (healthy) , just as your nefesh (soul) is matsli'ach (successful)."
3 Yochanan,1,3,"For I had simcha gedola (much joy) when the Achim b'Moshiach arrived [here] and gave eidus (testimony) of you being in HaEmes (the Truth) , just as your walk is halakhah b'Derech Emes (conduct in the Way of Truth)."
3 Yochanan,1,4,"I have no greater simcha than this, to hear of my bnei b'Moshiach, that their walk is halakhah b'Derech Emes."
3 Yochanan,1,5,"Chaver, you do a thing of emunah (faith) when it is done for the Achim b'Moshiach, especially when they are people you don't know."
3 Yochanan,1,6,They gave eidushaft (witness of testimony) to your ahavah (agape) before the kehillah (assembly) [here]; you will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of Hashem.
3 Yochanan,1,7,"For, on behalf of Hashem they went forth, taking nothing from the Goyim."
3 Yochanan,1,8,"Therefore, we ought to give hachnosas orchim (hospitality) to such, in order that we may be ozrim (helpers) with HaEmes."
3 Yochanan,1,9,"I wrote something to the kehillah [there]; but Diotrephes, who has fallen in love with being “Rosh of the Kehillah,” does not receive us."
3 Yochanan,1,10,"Oib azoi (consequently) , if I come, I will remember his “ma'asim” (works) which he does, his bringing unjustified charges against us with lashon horah (evil speech) . And not being satisfied with performing these “mitzvot”, he even refuses to receive the Achim b'Moshiach, and, those intending to do so, he hinders and expels out of the kehillah."
3 Yochanan,1,11,"Chaver, do not imitate HaRah (Evil) ; rather, imitate HaTov (Good) . The one doing HaTov is from Hashem . The one doing HaRah has not regarded Hashem."
3 Yochanan,1,12,"To Demetrius, eidus (witness of testimony, commendation) has been given by all and, personally, by no less than HaEmes (the Truth) ; we also give eidus, and you have da'as that our eidus is emes."
3 Yochanan,1,13,"I had many things to write to you, but I do not want to write to you with pen and ink."
3 Yochanan,1,14,"But I have the tikvah (hope) to see you imminently, and we will speak panim el panim (directly, in person)."
3 Yochanan,1,15,Drishat Shalom to you. Drishat Shalom from the Chaverim [here]. Drishat Shalom by name to each of the Chaverim [there].
