2 Thessalonians,1,1,"From Sha'ul and Silvanus (Sila) and Timotiyos. To the Kehillah of the inhabitants of the city of Thessalonika, the Kehillah in Hashem , in Elohim Avinu and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu,"
2 Thessalonians,1,2,Chen v'Chesed Hashem to you and Shalom from Elohim Avinu and Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu.
2 Thessalonians,1,3,"With continuous hodayah (thanksgiving) we ought to make brachot to Hashem concerning you, Achim b'Moshiach, as is fitting, because your emunah is increasing abundantly and the ahavah (agape) every one of you has for the other is growing."
2 Thessalonians,1,4,"Therefore, we ourselves glory in you in all the kehillot of Hashem for your zitzfleisch (patience) and emunah in all the redifot (persecutions) and the tzoros you are enduring."
2 Thessalonians,1,5,"This is kluhr (obvious) that here is a manifest siman (sign, indication) of the yashar mishpat (righteous judgment) of Hashem intended for you to be deemed worthy of the Malchut Hashem , on behalf of which also you undergo yissurim."
2 Thessalonians,1,6,"Indeed it is tzaddik (a thing examined and found to be right) for Hashem to repay with tzarah (tribulation) those who bring tzarah (tribulation) on you,"
2 Thessalonians,1,7,"And to recompense you, the ones suffering tzarah (tribulation) , with revachah (relief) along with us at the Apocalypse of [Moshiach] Yehoshua Adoneinu from Shomayim with the malachim of his oz (power)"
2 Thessalonians,1,8,"BELAHAVEI EISH (in flaming fire) , giving Onesh to the ones not knowing Hashem and to the ones not obeying the Besuras HaGeulah of [Moshiach] Yehoshua Adoneinu."
2 Thessalonians,1,9,"These are the ones who will pay an Onesh of Avaddon Olam (Eternal Destruction) away from the Shechinah of Hashem UMEHADAR GE'ONO (and from the splendor of his majesty),"
2 Thessalonians,1,10,"When He comes to be glorified among His Kedoshim and to be marveled at among all the ma'aminim in YOM HAHU (that Day) , because our [martyrʼs] eidus to you was believed."
2 Thessalonians,1,11,"To this end also we make tefillos always concerning you that Eloheinu may count you worthy of the Kri'ah (Calling) and by His gevurah may fulfill every chafetz hatov (good desire) and ma'aseh haemunah (work of faith),"
2 Thessalonians,1,12,"In order that ha-Shem (the Name) of [Moshiach] Adoneinu Yehoshua may be glorified in you, and you, in him, according to the unmerited Chen v'Chesed of Eloheinu and Moshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu."
2 Thessalonians,2,1,"We ask you, Achim b'Moshiach, concerning the Bias HaMoshiach (the Arrival, Coming of Moshiach) Yehoshua Adoneinu and our being gathered together to him,"
2 Thessalonians,2,2,"that you not become too hastily disturbed from your spiritual composure nor frightened either by a ruach or by a dibur (saying, utterance) or by an iggeret (letter) , as if from us, saying that the YOM HASHEM (Day of the L-rd) has come."
2 Thessalonians,2,3,"Let no one in any way lead you astray, because, unless the Merid (Rebellion, Revolt, the Shmad Betrayal Defection of Apostasy, the Azivah Abandonment) Desertion comes rishonah (first) , and the Apocalypse of the Ish HaMufkarut (Man of Lawlessness) , the Ish HaChatta'ah Ben HaAvaddon (Man of Sin, Son of Destruction Anti-Moshiach) is unveiled…"
2 Thessalonians,2,4,"I'm referring to the one setting himself against and exalting himself AL KOL EL (above every G-d) , above all that is given the appellation “G-d” or object of worship, with the result that in the Beis Hamikdash Heikhal he sits down on the MOSHAV ELOHIM (throne of G-d) , proclaiming that he himself is Elohim…"
2 Thessalonians,2,5,Do you not recall that when I was still with you I was telling you these things?
2 Thessalonians,2,6,"Yet you have da'as of what is holding back and restraining now, so that he may be unveiled and revealed in his own time."
2 Thessalonians,2,7,For the Sod HaMufkarut (Mystery of Lawlessness) is already working; only he who holds back and restrains just now will do so until he is out of the way.
2 Thessalonians,2,8,"And then the Ish HaMufkarut (the Man of Lawlessness) will be revealed, whom HaAdon will destroy by the RUACH of His mouth and will wipe out at the appearance of His Bi'as (HaMoshiach, His Parousia, Coming)."
2 Thessalonians,2,9,"The Bi'as Anti-Moshiach (Coming, Parousia, of Anti-Moshiach) is according to the working of HaSatan with all false ko'ach (power) and otot (signs) and pseudo moftim (wonders),"
2 Thessalonians,2,10,"And with all deception of resha (wickedness) for those who are perishing, because they were not being mekabel (receiving) the Ahavas HaEmes (Love of the Truth) so that they have the Geulah deliverance."
2 Thessalonians,2,11,"And for this reason Hashem sends to them a powerful madduchei shav (false enticement, delusion) in order that they believe what is sheker."
2 Thessalonians,2,12,"This is for the tachlis (purpose) of condemning to Onesh all the ones who have no emunah in HaEmes, but instead have had delight in resha."
2 Thessalonians,2,13,"But we ought always to offer hodayah (thanksgiving) and make brachot to Hashem concerning you, Achim b'Moshiach, ahuvei Hashem , because Hashem chose you as bikkurim (first fruits) for the Geulah through mekudash b'Ruach HaKodesh (being set apart as holy in the Ruach HaKodesh) and through emunah in HaEmes."
2 Thessalonians,2,14,This is HaEmes to which Hashem called you through our Besuras HaGeulah to the obtaining of the kavod of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua.
2 Thessalonians,2,15,"So then, Achim b'Moshiach, stand fast and hold fast to the emunah, the Moshiachʼs pnimiyus haTorah that was handed over and transmitted to you, which you were taught, whether by divrei pinu (words of our mouth) or by our iggeret hakodesh."
2 Thessalonians,2,16,"Now may HaMelech HaMoshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu Himself and Elohim Avinu, who has regarded us with ahavah (agape) , and has granted us nechamat olam (eternal consolation) and tikvah tovah (good hope) by the unmerited Chesed of Hashem,"
2 Thessalonians,2,17,May He give chozek (strength) and encouragement to you in every mitzvah (good deed) you do and in every dibur (utterance) you speak.
2 Thessalonians,3,1,"Lemaskana (finally) , Achim b'Moshiach, daven for us, that the Dvar Hashem will run on and be lifted up in kavod, just as it is also with you,"
2 Thessalonians,3,2,"And that we may be delivered from anshei resha (men of wickedness) , for not all possess the Messianic emunah."
2 Thessalonians,3,3,"But Ne'eman (Faithful) is Hashem who gives you chozek (strength) and is shomer over you, guarding you from the Evil One."
2 Thessalonians,3,4,"And we have bitachon in Hashem concerning you, that you are doing and will continue to do what we have directed."
2 Thessalonians,3,5,Now may Hashem direct your levavot in the Ahavas Hashem and into the savlanut of Moshiach.
2 Thessalonians,3,6,"Now we charge you, Achim b'Moshiach, b'Shem Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, to shun chavrusashaft (association) with every one of the Achim b'Moshiach who follows the derech habatlanim (way of idlers) and walks not according to Moshiachʼs [pnimiyus] haTorah that was handed over and transmitted to you and which you received from us."
2 Thessalonians,3,7,"For you yourselves have da'as how it is necessary to imitate us as a mofet, a role model, because we were not batlanim (idlers) among you."
2 Thessalonians,3,8,"Nor did we eat lechem (food) from anyone gratis, but in labor and exertion lailah v'yomam (night and day) we were working for the tachlis (purpose) of not weighing down and burdening any one of you;"
2 Thessalonians,3,9,"Not because we do not have the zchus (right) , but in order that we impart ourselves as a mofet (role model) to you that you might imitate us."
2 Thessalonians,3,10,"For even when we were with you, this we used to direct you: that if anyone will not be a po'el (worker) , neither let him be an ochel (eater)."
2 Thessalonians,3,11,"For we hear that some among you are leading the life of a batlan (loafer) , not being busy with a parnasah, but being busybodies with hitarevut (meddlesomeness)."
2 Thessalonians,3,12,"Now such persons we are directing and exhort in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua Adoneinu to work with quietness that they may eat their own lechem."
2 Thessalonians,3,13,"But you, Achim b'Moshiach, do not lose chozek in well-doing."
2 Thessalonians,3,14,"But if anyone does not obey the gzeira (injunction) in this iggeret hakodesh (holy letter) , take special notice of that one; do not have chavrusashaft (association) with him, for the tachlis (purpose) of stirring him with a sense of bushah (shame)."
2 Thessalonians,3,15,And do not consider (him) an oyev (enemy) but warn him as an Ach b'Moshiach.
2 Thessalonians,3,16,Now may Elohei HaShalom Himself grant you shalom in every way. Hashem be with you all.
2 Thessalonians,3,17,"I, [Rav] Sha'ul, send Drishat Shalom greetings in my own handwriting, which is the distinctive siman (sign) in every iggeret hakodesh; this is the way I write."
2 Thessalonians,3,18,"The unmerited Chen v'Chesed Hashem of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua be with you all."
