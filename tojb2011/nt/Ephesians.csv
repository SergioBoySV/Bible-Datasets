Ephesians,4,15,"But saying HaEmes in ahavah, let us grow up in every respect unto Him who is the Rosh, Moshiach,"

Ephesians,4,17,"This therefore I say and give solemn edut in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu: no longer are you to fier zich (comport oneself) in your derech as also the Goyim walk, in the futility of their machshavot (thoughts),"
Ephesians,4,18,"Their binah (understanding) being in choshech, having been alienated from the life of Hashem because of the ignorance existing in them, because of the KESHI (stubbornness, hardness) of their levavot,"

Ephesians,5,1,"Therefore, be imitators of Hashem as beloved yeladim,"
Ephesians,5,2,"And fier zich (comport oneself) in your derech in ahavah, as also Moshiach had ahavah for us and gave Himself up on behalf of us as a korban and zevach to Hashem for a RE'ACH HANNICHOACH (a pleasant aroma)."
Ephesians,5,3,"But do not let zenut (fornication) or anything of tumah (uncleanness) or chamdanut (covetousness) even be named among you, as is proper for Kedoshim."
Ephesians,5,4,"And also let there be nothing that is an ERVAT DAVAR (indecent thing) or the tipshus (foolery) or foolish talking of letzim (coarse jesting) or shtiklech (misconduct) , which are not fitting, but rather hodayah (thanksgiving)."
Ephesians,5,5,"For of this you have da'as vada (with certainty) , that every zoneh (fornicator) or impure person or covetous person — chamdanut is avodah zarah, avodah elilim — does not have a nachalah in the Malchut of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and of Hashem."

Ephesians,5,8,"For you were once Choshech, but now you are Ohr (Light) in Hashem . Fier zich (comport oneself) in your derech as yeladim of HaOhr."
Ephesians,5,9,"For the p'ri HaOhr is in doing chesed and tzedek and emes,"
Ephesians,5,10,Proving that which is well-pleasing be'einei Hashem (in the eyes of G-d).
Ephesians,5,11,"And do not involve yourself in the ma'asei haChoshech (works of darkness) , those works without p'ri; but rather even expose them."
Ephesians,5,12,"For as to the things being done by them under cover of secrecy, it brings bushah (shame) and is a bizayon (disgrace) even to speak of them."
Ephesians,5,13,"But everything being exposed by HaOhr (Light) becomes visible,"
Ephesians,5,14,"For everything becoming visible is HaOhr (Light) ; therefore here is the meaning of these words, KUMI (Rise up) , sleeper, and arise from the MESIM, AND Moshiach WILL SHINE ON YOU."
Ephesians,5,15,"Therefore, fier zich (comport oneself) in your derech with a careful walk, not as kesilim (fools) but as chachamim (wise ones),"

Ephesians,5,22,"Nashim (wives) , make yourselves accountable to your ba'alim (husbands) as to Adoneinu,"
Ephesians,5,23,"Because a ba'al (husband) is rosh of the isha as also Moshiach is rosh of the Brit Chadasha Kehillah, being Himself the Go'el (Savior) of HaGuf (the Body of Moshiach)."
Ephesians,5,24,"But as the Brit Chadasha Kehillah is accountable to Moshiach, so also the nashim should be to their ba'alim in everything."

Ephesians,5,28,"So also the ba'alim ought to show ahavah for their own nashim as their own gufim; the one with ahavah for his own isha has ahavah for himself,"
Ephesians,5,29,"For no one ever had sin'as chinom for his own basar but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach also does the Brit Chadasha Kehillah,"
Ephesians,5,30,Because we are evarim of HaGuf HaMoshiach.

Ephesians,6,9,"And, adonim, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening, having da'as that both their and your Adon is in Shomayim, and ein masso panim im Hashem (there is no partiality with Hashem)."
Ephesians,6,10,"For the rest, be continually empowered in the ko'ach of Hashem and in the oz of His gevurah."
Ephesians,6,11,"Put on the whole armor of Hashem for you to be able to stand against the nechalim (scheming deceitfulness, wiles, evil plots) of HaSatan."
Ephesians,6,12,"Because we are not wrestling against basar vadahm (flesh and blood) , but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of the choshech of the Olam Hazeh, against the kokhot ruchaniyim ra'im (evil spiritual forces) in Shomayim."
Ephesians,6,13,"Therefore, take up the whole armor of Hashem , that you may be able to withstand in the Yom HaRah and, having done all, to stand."
Ephesians,6,14,"Stand, therefore, having girded your waist with HaEmes and having put on the breastplate of Tzedek,"
Ephesians,6,15,And having put as shoes on your feet that which makes you ready to be a maggid of the Besuras HaGeulah.
Ephesians,6,16,"With all these things, take up the shield of emunah, by which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of haRah (the Evil one);"
Ephesians,6,17,"And take the Kova HaYeshuah (Helmet of Salvation) and cherev of Ruach Hakodesh, which is the Dvar Hashem."
Ephesians,6,18,Daven in the Ruach Hakodesh always with all tefillos and techinnah (supplication) . To that end keep shomer and always persevere in techinnah (supplication) for the Kedoshim;
Ephesians,6,19,"And for me also, that to me may be given utterance in opening my mouth in boldness to make known the Sod HaBesuras HaGeulah,"
Ephesians,6,20,"On behalf of which I am an emissary in chains, that in it I may be bold as it is necessary for me to speak."
