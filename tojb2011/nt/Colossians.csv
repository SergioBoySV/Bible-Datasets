Colossians,1,1,"Sha'ul a Shliach of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua through the ratzon Hashem and Timotiyos the Ach b'Moshiach;"
Colossians,1,2,"To the Kedoshim in Colossae, the Achim b'Moshiach, the Achim HaNe'emanim. Chen v'Chesed Hashem to you and shalom from Elohim Avinu."
Colossians,1,3,"Hodinu l' Hashem (we give thanks to Hashem) Elohim HaAv of Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, davening always concerning you,"
Colossians,1,4,"Having heard of your emunah in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua and the ahavah which you have for all the Kedoshim,"
Colossians,1,5,"On account of the tikvah (hope) being laid up for you in Shomayim, the tikvah which you heard of before in the Dvar HaEmes, the Besuras HaGeulah"
Colossians,1,6,"That has come to you, as also in all the Olam Hazeh it is bearing p'ri and growing, so also in you, from the day you heard it and began to have saving da'as of the Chen v'Chesed Hashem in actuality."
Colossians,1,7,"This you learned from Epaphras, our chaver and fellow eved, who is ne'eman (faithful) , who is a trusted keli kodesh (minister) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach for you."
Colossians,1,8,Epaphras also revealed to us your ahavah in the Ruach Hakodesh.
Colossians,1,9,"Therefore, we also, from the day that we heard, do not cease davening for you and offering tefillos that you be filled with da'as of the ratzon Hashem in all chochmah and binah in the Ruach Hakodesh."
Colossians,1,10,"And this is the purpose: that you walk in hitnahagut (conduct) worthy of Adoneinu in every way pleasing to him in every mitzvoh bearing p'ri in the da'as of Hashem,"
Colossians,1,11,"With all ko'ach being empowered according to the gevurah (power) of his kavod for all savlanut (patience) and orech ruach (longsuffering) with lev same'ach (glad heart),"
Colossians,1,12,Giving todot to Elohim HaAv. Elohim HaAv is the One who has qualified you for the share of the allotted nachalah (inheritance) of the Kedoshim in Ohr (Light);
Colossians,1,13,"Elohim HaAv is the One who rescued nafsheinu (our souls) from the memshalet (dominion) of Choshech and transferred us into the Malchut of the Zun fun der Oybershter of His ahavah,"
Colossians,1,14,"In whom we have the pedut (redemption, Geulah release on payment of ransom) through the [kapporah] dahm of Moshiach the selicha (forgiveness) of chatoteinu (our sins)."
Colossians,1,15,"Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is the demut of the invisible G-d, the Bechor, the Yoresh (Heir) of kol hanivrah (all creation),"
Colossians,1,16,"Because in Him were created all things in Shomayim and on Ha'Aretz, the visible and the nistar (hidden) , whether thrones or dominions, whether rulers or authorities, all things through Him and for Him have been created."
Colossians,1,17,"And Moshiach is before all things, and all things in Moshiach have been held together;"
Colossians,1,18,"And Moshiach is the Rosh of the Geviyah (Body), and the Geviyah (nevilah) is Moshiachʼs Brit Chadasha Kehillah; Moshiach is its Reshit, the Bechor from the Mesim, that Moshiach might be in everything pre-eminent,"
Colossians,1,19,"Because Hashem was pleased that all His fullness have its mishkan (tabernacle) in Moshiach,"
Colossians,1,20,"And through Moshiach to bring ritztzuy (reconciliation, cessation of enmity, hostility between a wrathful holy G-d and sinful Bnei Adam) between all things and Himself, having made shalom through the dahm of the kapporah of HaEtz HaMoshiach, whether the things on HaAretz or the things in HaShomayim."
Colossians,1,21,"And you, once having been alienated and oyvim (enemies) in the mind by ma'asim hara'im (evil deeds),"
Colossians,1,22,"Yet now Moshiach reconciled in the Guf (body) of his basar through Moshiachʼs histalkus to present you, Kedoshim holy and without mum (defect) and without reproach before Him,"
Colossians,1,23,"Provided you remain in the Emunah, having been founded in it and securely established and not moving away from the tikvah (hope) of the Besuras HaGeulah which you heard, the Besuras HaGeulah which has been proclaimed in kol hanivrah (all creation) under Shomayim, the Besuras HaGeulah of which I, Rav Sha'ul, became a keli kodesh (minister)."
Colossians,1,24,"Now with lev same'ach (glad heart) and chedvah (rejoicing) I rejoice in my suffering tzoros on behalf of you. And I am mashlim (supply what is deficient) the things lacking of the Chevlei Moshiach in my basar on behalf of the basar of Moshiach which is the Brit Chadasha Kehillah,"
Colossians,1,25,"Of which I became a keli kodesh according to the pekudat Hashem (stewardship of G-d, His shlichus commission) which was given to me for you, to carry to shleimut (wholeness, completion) the Dvar Hashem,"
Colossians,1,26,"The raz (mystery) having been hidden from olamim and from dor v'dor, but now made manifest to the Kedoshim of Moshiach,"
Colossians,1,27,"To whom Hashem wanted to make hisgalus of what is the spiritual osher of the kavod of this raz among the non-Jews: Moshiach in you, the tikvah of kavod."
Colossians,1,28,"It is Moshiach who is the subject of our hattafah (preaching) , warning every man and teaching every man in all chochmah, that we may present every man Bnei Chayil mature in Moshiach."
Colossians,1,29,"For this also I toil, striving according to the hitlahavut (inspiration, enthusiasm) of Him working in me with gevurah."
Colossians,2,1,"For I want you to have da'as of how great a ma'avak (struggle) I have for you and the ones in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen me panim el panim (directly, in person),"
Colossians,2,2,"That their levavot may be given chozek (strength) , having been made an aguda of ahavah and all osher (wealth) of the full assurance of binah, resulting in the da'as of the raz of Hashem , namely Moshiach,"
Colossians,2,3,In whom is nistar (hidden) all the otzarot (treasures) of chochmah and da'as.
Colossians,2,4,This I say so that no one may delude you with the sleight of hand of the ba'al melitzot (rhetorician).
Colossians,2,5,"For, though absent in basar, but present with you in the Ruach Hakodesh, with lev same'ach (glad heart) I am seeing your order and the firmness of your emunah in Moshiach."
Colossians,2,6,"Therefore, as you became mekabel Moshiach and received Moshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua, so let your halichah be in Him,"
Colossians,2,7,"Having been rooted and built up in Moshiach and being firmly founded in the emunah as you were given Messianic lernen (study) , abounding in hodayah."
Colossians,2,8,"Beware lest there be anyone of you taken captive through philosophical tevunah (wisdom) and empty deceit according to the kabbalah (oral tradition) of mere Bnei Adam, according to the ikkarim (basic principles) of the Olam Hazeh and not according to Moshiach;"
Colossians,2,9,"Because in Moshiach kol melo Elohim (all the plentitude of G-d) finds its bodily maon laShechinah (dwelling place for the Shechinah, mitgashem)."
Colossians,2,10,"And you have been granted melo (plentitude) in Moshiach, who is the Rosh of all rule and authority."
Colossians,2,11,"In Moshiach also you were circumcised with a Bris Milah not made with human hands, a Bris Milah of the surgically removing of the body of the basar (old fallen and unregenerate nature) in the Bris Milah of Moshiach,"
Colossians,2,12,"Having been buried in the Ohel of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiachʼs tevilah with him, with whom also you were made to stand up spiritually in the Techiyah together through your emunah and bitachon in the ma'aseh of Hashem who made Moshiach stand up from the Mesim."
Colossians,2,13,"And you being dead in your peysha'im and your orlat basar (uncircumcision of flesh) he made alive together, you together with Moshiach, having granted you selicha for all your peysha'im;"
Colossians,2,14,"Having erased the hand-signed sefer of guilt choiv (debt) , the heavenly indictment against us in the maleh chukat haTorah (full statute requirement of the Torah) , which was against us. Moshiach has done away with this opposing record, having nailed it to Moshiachʼs Etz."
Colossians,2,15,"Having disarmed the rulers and the authorities, He made a public spectacle of them, having triumphed over them by Moshiachʼs Etz."
Colossians,2,16,"Therefore, let no one judge you [Goyim] in eating and in drinking or in respect to a yom tov (yontev) or a rosh chodesh or Shabbos;"
Colossians,2,17,"Which are a shadow of the things to come in the Olam HaBah; but the reality, the substance, is Moshiach."
Colossians,2,18,"Let no one deprive you of the prize by delighting in his mystical asceticism and his veneration of malachim and delving into his chazonot (visions) and being vainly puffed up by the machshavot (thoughts) of his basar (old nature unrenewed and unregenerated by the Ruach Hakodesh),"
Colossians,2,19,"And not holding on to the Rosh, out of whom all the Moshiachʼs Guf, being fully supplied and being be'ichud (united) together through the joints and ligaments, grows with the growth of Hashem."
Colossians,2,20,"Als (Since) you died with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to the ikkarim (basic principles) of the Olam Hazeh, why, as though you still belonged to the keyam (existence) of the Olam Hazeh, do you (Goyim) chain yourself to chumra legalisms?"
Colossians,2,21,“Do not touch; do not taste; do not handle.”
Colossians,2,22,"The things referred to are all destined to deterioration with use, according to the humanly contrived mitzvot and the humanly contrived chukim (laws) of mere Bnei Adam,"
Colossians,2,23,"Which things have a superficial appearance of chochmah in self-imposed religion and mystical asceticism and severe physical mortification, but are of no value against the indulgence of the yetzer (the so-called basar unrenewed and unregenerated by the Ruach Hakodesh)."
Colossians,3,1,"If therefore you were made to stand up alive in hitkhadshut with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, seek the things above, where Moshiach is, LI'MINI (at my right hand), sitting at the right hand of Hashem."
Colossians,3,2,"Place your machshavot (thoughts) above (in Shomayim) , not on the things of the Olam Hazeh."
Colossians,3,3,For you died and the Chayyim of you has become nistar (hidden) with Moshiach in Hashem.
Colossians,3,4,"When Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach who is Chayyeinu (our Life) is made manifest in hisgalus (revelation) , then also you with Him will be made manifest in hisgalus in kavod."
Colossians,3,5,"Therefore, put to death your evarim (members) in the Olam Hazeh: zenut (fornication) , debauchery, sensuality, zimmah (licentiousness) , and chamdanut (covetousness) , which is avodah zarah (idolatry)."
Colossians,3,6,Because of such things as these the charon af Hashem habah (the coming burning wrath of Hashem) is on the way.
Colossians,3,7,"Such was your derech to fier zich (comport oneself) , the derech resha'im formerly, when you were living in these things."
Colossians,3,8,"But now you also put away all these things: ka'as (anger) , rage, kavvanah ra'ah (malice) , and chillul Hashem . Put away loshon hora from your mouth."
Colossians,3,9,"Do not speak sheker to one another, having disrobed from the Adam hakadmoni (old humanity) with his ma'asim (works),"
Colossians,3,10,"And instead enrobe with the Adam HaChadash, the one being renewed in da'as in accordance with the demut of the One having created him."
Colossians,3,11,"Here there is neither Yevani nor Yehudi, there is neither those who are or are not of the Bris Milah, there is no uncultured non-Greek speaker, there is no Scythian, eved, or Ben Chorin, but rather Moshiach is all in all."
Colossians,3,12,"Therefore, as Bechirim (Chosen ones) of Hashem , Kedoshim and ahuvim, enrobe yourselves in tender feelings of rachmei Shomayim (heavenly compassion, mercy) , chesed (lovingkindness) , anavah (humility) , shiflut (lowliness) , and savlanut (longsuffering),"
Colossians,3,13,"Being soivel (bearing with) one another and extending selicha (forgiveness) to each other, if it should be that one is murmuring his complaint against another; just as Adoneinu extended selicha to you, so also you should extend selicha."
Colossians,3,14,"And to all these things add ahavah, which is the agudah of tamimim."
Colossians,3,15,And let the shalom of Moshiach arbitrate in your levavot. You were called to this shalom in one GUF. Let there be todah in your levavot.
Colossians,3,16,"Let the dvar of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach make its mishkan in you richly, in all chochmah and in all Moshiachʼs pnimiyus haTorah (innermost Torah teaching) and words of chizzuk, ministering to one another with Tehillim, shirim, and neshamah niggunim miRuach Hakodesh (soul melodies from the Ruach Hakodesh) with gratitude, singing in your levavot to Hashem."
Colossians,3,17,"And whatever thing you do, whether in dvar or in ma'aseh, do all things b'Shem Adoneinu Yehoshua, giving todot to Elohim HaAv through him."
Colossians,3,18,"Nashim (wives) , make yourselves accountable to your ba'alim (husbands) , as is proper in Adoneinu."

Colossians,3,21,"Avot, do not provoke your yeladim, lest they be disheartened."
Colossians,3,22,"Avadim (servants) , each of you obey in all things your adon according to the basar, not with eye service as pleasers of Bnei Adam, but with tom lev, with yirat Shomayim."
Colossians,3,23,"Whatever you do, be po'alim (workers) who with their neshamah work facing Adoneinu and not Bnei Adam,"
Colossians,3,24,"Having da'as that from Adoneinu you will receive the sachar of the nachalah (alloted inheritance) . Serve Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach."
Colossians,3,25,"For the one doing wrong will be repaid for his wrong, ki ein masso panim im Hashem (for there is no respect of persons with G-d, no partiality)."
