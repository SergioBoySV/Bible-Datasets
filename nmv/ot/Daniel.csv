Daniel,1,1,"In the third year of the reign of Y’hoyakim king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] came N’vukhadnetzar king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and besieged it."
Daniel,1,2,"And the Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All Things] gave Y’hoyakim king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : which he carried into the land of Shin’ar [country of two rivers] to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god."
Daniel,1,3,"And the king spoke unto Ashp’naz [I will make prominent the sprinkled] the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring [certain] of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and of the king’s seed, and of the princes;"
Daniel,1,4,"Children in whom [was] no blemish, but well favoured, and skillful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as [had] ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Kasdim [clod-breakers]."
Daniel,1,5,"And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king."
Daniel,1,6,"Now among these were of the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , Dani’el [God is Judge] , Hananyah [God has favoured] , Michael [Who is what God is] , and ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped]:"
Daniel,1,7,"Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Dani’el [God is Judge] [the name] of Belt-shatzar [lord of the straitened (impeded or restricted; narrowed, distressed)’s treasure]; and to Hananyah [God has favoured] , of Shadrakh [royal, or the great scribe] ; and to Michael [Who is what God is] , of Meishakh [guest of the king] ; and to ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] , of ‘Aved-N’go [servant of Nebo]."
Daniel,1,8,"But Dani’el [God is Judge] purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself."
Daniel,1,9,Now God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had brought Dani’el [God is Judge] into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.
Daniel,1,10,"And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Dani’el [God is Judge] , I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which [are] of your sort? then shall you 2f make [me] endanger my head to the king."
Daniel,1,11,"Then said Dani’el [God is Judge] to the guard, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Dani’el [God is Judge] , Hananyah [God has favoured] , Michael [Who is what God is] , and ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped],"
Daniel,1,12,"Prove you i servants, I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , ten days; and let them give us pulse (peas; beans; legumes) to eat, and water to drink."
Daniel,1,13,"Then let our countenances be looked upon before you i , and the Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor) of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat: and as you i see, deal with you i servants."
Daniel,1,14,"So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days."
Daniel,1,15,And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat.
Daniel,1,16,"Thus the guard took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse (peas; beans; legumes)."
Daniel,1,17,"As for these four children, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Dani’el [God is Judge] had understanding in all visions and dreams."
Daniel,1,18,"Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before N’vukhadnetzar."
Daniel,1,19,"And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Dani’el [God is Judge] , Hananyah [God has favoured] , Misha’el [Who is what God is] , and ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] : therefore stood they before the king."
Daniel,1,20,"And in all matters of wisdom [and] understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians [and] astrologers that [were] in all his realm."
Daniel,1,21,And Dani’el [God is Judge] continued [even] unto the first year of king Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace].
Daniel,2,1,"And in the second year of the reign of N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] , N’vukhadnetzar dreamed dreams, which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him."
Daniel,2,2,"Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , for to show the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king."
Daniel,2,3,"And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream."
Daniel,2,4,"Then spoke the Kasdim [clod-breakers] to the king in Aramaic, O king, live forever: tell your i servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation."
Daniel,2,5,"The king answered and said to the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , The thing is gone from me: if you 2f will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, you 2f shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill."
Daniel,2,6,"But if you 2f show the dream, and the interpretation thereof, you 2f shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore show me the dream, and the interpretation thereof."
Daniel,2,7,"They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it."
Daniel,2,8,"The king answered and said, I know of certainty that you 2f would gain the time, because you 2f see the thing is gone from me."
Daniel,2,9,"But if you 2f will not make known unto me the dream, [there is but] one decree for you: for you 2f have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you 2f can show me the interpretation thereof."
Daniel,2,10,"The Kasdim [clod-breakers] answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king’s matter: therefore [there is] no king, lord, nor ruler, [that] asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean."
Daniel,2,11,"And [it is] a rare thing that the king requires, and there is none other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."
Daniel,2,12,"For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise [men] of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Daniel,2,13,And the decree went forth that the wise [men] should be slain; and they sought Dani’el [God is Judge] and his fellows to be slain.
Daniel,2,14,"Then Dani’el [God is Judge] answered with counsel and wisdom to Aryokh [lion-like] the captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise [men] of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]:"
Daniel,2,15,"He answered and said to Aryokh [lion-like] the king’s captain, Why [is] the decree [so] hasty from the king? Then Aryokh [lion-like] made the thing known to Dani’el [God is Judge]."
Daniel,2,16,"Then Dani’el [God is Judge] went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation."
Daniel,2,17,"Then Dani’el [God is Judge] went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananyah [God has favoured] , Misha’el [Who is what God is] , and ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] , his companions:"
Daniel,2,18,"That they would desire mercies of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of heaven concerning this secret; that Dani’el [God is Judge] and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise [men] of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Daniel,2,19,Then was the secret revealed unto Dani’el [God is Judge] in a night vision. Then Dani’el [God is Judge] Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of heaven.
Daniel,2,20,"Dani’el [God is Judge] answered and said, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) be the name of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] forever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:"
Daniel,2,21,"And he changes the times and the seasons: he removes kings, and sets up kings: he gives wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:"
Daniel,2,22,"He reveals the deep and secret things: he knows what [is] in the darkness, and the light dwells with him."
Daniel,2,23,"I thank you i , and praise you i , O you i God-Elah [an oak] of my fathers, who have given me wisdom and might, and have made known unto me now what we desired of you i : for you i have [now] made known unto us the king’s matter."
Daniel,2,24,"Therefore Dani’el [God is Judge] went in unto Aryokh [lion-like] , whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise [men] of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] : he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise [men] of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] : bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation."
Daniel,2,25,"Then Aryokh [lion-like] brought in Dani’el [God is Judge] before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , that will make known unto the king the interpretation."
Daniel,2,26,"The king answered and said to Dani’el [God is Judge] , whose name [was] Belt-shatzar [lord of the straitened (impeded or restricted; narrowed, distressed)’s treasure], Are you i able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?"
Daniel,2,27,"Dani’el [God is Judge] answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king has demanded cannot the wise [men] , the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, show unto the king;"
Daniel,2,28,"But there is a God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in heaven that reveals secrets, and makes known to the king N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] what shall be in the latter days. You 1s dream, and the visions of you i head upon you i bed, are these;"
Daniel,2,29,"As for you i , O king, you i thoughts came [into you i mind] upon you i bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that reveals secrets makes known to you i what shall come to pass."
Daniel,2,30,"But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for [any] wisdom that I have more than any living, but for [their] sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that you i might know the thoughts of you i heart."
Daniel,2,31,"you i , O king, saw, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness [was] excellent, stood before you i ; and the form thereof [was] terrible."
Daniel,2,32,"This image’s head [was] of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,"
Daniel,2,33,"His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay."
Daniel,2,34,"you i saw till that a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image upon his feet [that were] of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces."
Daniel,2,35,"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that struck the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."
Daniel,2,36,This [is] the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
Daniel,2,37,"you i , O king, [are] a king of kings: for the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of heaven has given you i a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory."
Daniel,2,38,"And wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven has he given into you i hand, and has made you i ruler over them all. you i [are] this head of gold."
Daniel,2,39,"And after you i shall arise another kingdom inferior to you i , and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth."
Daniel,2,40,"And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and subdues all [things] : and as iron that breaks all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise."
Daniel,2,41,"And whereas you i saw the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as you i saw the iron mixed with miry clay."
Daniel,2,42,"And [as] the toes of the feet [were] part of iron, and part of clay, [so] the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken."
Daniel,2,43,"And whereas you i saw iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave (split open; cut open; divide) one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay."
Daniel,2,44,"And in the days of these kings shall the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, [but] it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever."
Daniel,2,45,"Forasmuch as you i saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream [is] certain, and the interpretation thereof sure."
Daniel,2,46,"Then the king N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] fell upon his face, and worshipped Dani’el [God is Judge] , and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him."
Daniel,2,47,"The king answered unto Dani’el [God is Judge] , and said, Of a truth [it is] , that your God-Elah [an oak] [is] a God-Elah [an oak] of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing you i could reveal this secret."
Daniel,2,48,"Then the king made Dani’el [God is Judge] a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and chief of the governors over all the wise [men] of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Daniel,2,49,"Then Dani’el [God is Judge] requested of the king, and he set Shadrakh [royal, or the great scribe] , Meishakh [guest of the king] , and ‘Aved-N’go [servant of Nebo] , over the affairs of the province of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] : but Dani’el [God is Judge] [sat] in the gate of the king."
Daniel,3,1,"N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] the king made an image of gold, whose height [was] threescore cubits, [and] the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Daniel,3,2,"Then N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] the king had set up."
Daniel,3,3,"Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] the king had set up; and they stood before the image that N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] had set up."
Daniel,3,4,"Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,"
Daniel,3,5," [That] at what time you 2f hear the sound of the cornet (a wind instrument; horn; trumpet) , flute, harp, sackbut (triangular, 4-stringed instrument, like a lyre), Psaltery (stringed instrument, like an harp) , dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you 2f fall down and worship the golden image that N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] the king has set up:"
Daniel,3,6,And whoso falls not down and worships shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
Daniel,3,7,"Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet (a wind instrument; horn; trumpet) , flute, harp, sackbut (triangular, 4-stringed instrument, like a lyre) , Psaltery (stringed instrument, like an harp) , and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down [and] worshipped the golden image that N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] the king had set up."
Daniel,3,8,"For what reason at that time certain Kasdim [clod-breakers] came near, and accused the Y’hudim (Judeans)."
Daniel,3,9,"They spoke and said to the king N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] , O king, live forever."
Daniel,3,10,"you i , O king, have made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet (a wind instrument; horn; trumpet) , flute, harp, sackbut (triangular, 4-stringed instrument, like a lyre) , Psaltery (stringed instrument, like an harp) , and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image:"
Daniel,3,11,"And whoso falls not down and worships, [that] he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,12,"There are certain Y’hudim (Judeans) whom you i have set over the affairs of the province of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , Shadrakh [royal, or the great scribe] , Meishakh [guest of the king] , and ‘Aved-N’go [servant of Nebo] ; these men, O king, have not regarded you i : they serve not you i gods, nor worship the golden image which you i have set up."
Daniel,3,13,"Then N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] in [his] rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrakh [royal, or the great scribe] , Meishakh [guest of the king] , and ‘Aved-N’go [servant of Nebo] . Then they brought these men before the king."
Daniel,3,14,"N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] spoke and said unto them, [Is it] true, O Shadrakh [royal, or the great scribe] , Meishakh [guest of the king] , and ‘Aved-N’go [servant of Nebo] , do not you 2f serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?"
Daniel,3,15,"Now if you 2f be ready that at what time you 2f hear the sound of the cornet (a wind instrument; horn; trumpet) , flute, harp, sackbut (triangular, 4-stringed instrument, like a lyre), Psaltery (stringed instrument, like an harp) , and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you 2f fall down and worship the image which I have made; [well] : but if you 2f worship not, you 2f shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who [is] that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] that shall deliver you out of my hands?"
Daniel,3,16,"Shadrakh [royal, or the great scribe] , Meishakh [guest of the king] , and ‘Aved-N’go [servant of Nebo] , answered and said to the king, O N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] , we [are] not careful to answer you i in this matter."
Daniel,3,17,"If it be [so] , our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver [us] out of you i hand, O king."
Daniel,3,18,"But if not, be it known unto you i , O king, that we will not serve you i gods, nor worship the golden image which you i have set up."
Daniel,3,19,"Then was N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] full of fury, and the form of his visage (appearance; face; look of a person) was changed against Shadrakh [royal, or the great scribe] , Meishakh [guest of the king] , and ‘Aved-N’go [servant of Nebo]: [therefore] he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont (used to; in the habit of) to be heated."
Daniel,3,20,"And he commanded the most mighty men that [were] in his army to bind Shadrakh [royal, or the great scribe] , Meishakh [guest of the king] , and ‘Aved-N’go [servant of Nebo], [and] to cast [them] into the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,21,"Then these men were bound in their coats, their trousers, and their hats, and their [other] garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,22,"Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men that took up Shadrakh [royal, or the great scribe] , Meishakh [guest of the king] , and ‘Aved-N’go [servant of Nebo]."
Daniel,3,23,"And these three men, Shadrakh [royal, or the great scribe] , Meishakh [guest of the king] , and ‘Aved-N’go [servant of Nebo] , fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
Daniel,3,24,"Then N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, [and] spoke, and said unto his counselors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king."
Daniel,3,25,"He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Daniel,3,26,"Then N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, [and] spoke, and said, Shadrakh [royal, or the great scribe] ! Meishakh [guest of the king] ! ‘Aved-N’go [servant of Nebo] ! you 2f servants of the El ‘Elyon [The Most High The Living Word of God] , come forth, and come [here] . Then Shadrakh [royal, or the great scribe] , Meishakh [guest of the king] and ‘Aved-N’go [servant of Nebo] , came forth of the midst of the fire."
Daniel,3,27,"And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them."
Daniel,3,28," [Then] N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] spoke, and said, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Shadrakh [royal, or the great scribe] , Meishakh [guest of the king] , and ‘Aved-N’go [servant of Nebo] , who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Daniel,3,29,"Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak anything amiss (wrong; incorrect) against the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Shadrakh [royal, or the great scribe] , Meishakh [guest of the king] , and ‘Aved-N’go [servant of Nebo] , shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] that can deliver after this sort."
Daniel,3,30,"Then the king promoted Shadrakh [royal, or the great scribe] , Meishakh [guest of the king] , and ‘Aved-N’go [servant of Nebo] , in the province of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Daniel,4,1,"N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you."
Daniel,4,2,I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has wrought toward me.
Daniel,4,3,"How great [are] his signs! and how mighty [are] his wonders! his kingdom [is] an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion [is] from generation to generation."
Daniel,4,4,"I N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace:"
Daniel,4,5,"I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me."
Daniel,4,6,"Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise [men] of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream."
Daniel,4,7,"Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof."
Daniel,4,8,"But at the last Dani’el [God is Judge] came in before me, whose name [was] Belt-shatzar [lord of the straitened (impeded or restricted; narrowed, distressed)’s treasure] , according to the name of my god, and in whom [is] the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, [saying],"
Daniel,4,9,"O Belt-shatzar [lord of the straitened (impeded or restricted; narrowed, distressed)’s treasure] , master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods [is] in you i , and no secret troubles you i , tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof."
Daniel,4,10,"Thus [were] the visions of my head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof [was] great."
Daniel,4,11,"The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:"
Daniel,4,12,"The leaves thereof [were] fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it [was] meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it."
Daniel,4,13,"I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;"
Daniel,4,14,"He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:"
Daniel,4,15,"Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and [let] his portion [be] with the beasts in the grass of the earth:"
Daniel,4,16,"Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him."
Daniel,4,17,"This matter [is] by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will, and sets up over it the basest of men."
Daniel,4,18,"This dream I king N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] have seen. Now you i , O Belt-shatzar [lord of the straitened (impeded or restricted; narrowed, distressed)’s treasure] , declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise [men] of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but you i [are] able; for the spirit of the holy gods [is] in you i."
Daniel,4,19,"Then Dani’el [God is Judge] , whose name [was] Belt-shatzar [lord of the straitened (impeded or restricted; narrowed, distressed)’s treasure] , was astonished for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke, and said, Belt-shatzar [lord of the straitened (impeded or restricted; narrowed, distressed)’s treasure] , let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble you i . Belt-shatzar [lord of the straitened (impeded or restricted; narrowed, distressed)’s treasure] answered and said, My lord, the dream [be] to them that hate you i , and the interpretation thereof to you i enemies."
Daniel,4,20,"The tree that you i saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;"
Daniel,4,21,"Whose leaves [were] fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it [was] meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:"
Daniel,4,22,"It [is] you i , O king, that are grown and become strong: for you i greatness is grown, and reaches unto heaven, and you i dominion to the end of the earth."
Daniel,4,23,"And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and [let] his portion [be] with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;"
Daniel,4,24,"This [is] the interpretation, O king, and this [is] the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:"
Daniel,4,25,"That they shall drive you i from men, and you i dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make you i to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet you i with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you i , till you i know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will."
Daniel,4,26,"And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; you i kingdom shall be sure unto you i , after that you i shall have known that the heavens do rule."
Daniel,4,27,"For what reason, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto you i , and break off you i sins by righteousness, and you i iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of you i tranquility."
Daniel,4,28,All this came upon the king N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown].
Daniel,4,29,"At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Daniel,4,30,"The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?"
Daniel,4,31,"While the word [was] in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, [saying] , O king N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] , to you i it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from you i."
Daniel,4,32,"And they shall drive you i from men, and you i dwelling [shall be] with the beasts of the field: they shall make you i to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over you i , until you i know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will."
Daniel,4,33,"The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] : and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles’ [feathers] , and his nails like birds’ [claws]."
Daniel,4,34,"And at the end of the days I N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] lifted up my eyes unto heaven, and my understanding returned unto me, and I Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) the most High, and I praised and honoured him that lives forever, whose dominion [is] an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom [is] from generation to generation:"
Daniel,4,35,"And all the inhabitants of the earth [are] reputed as nothing: and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and [among] the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What do you i?"
Daniel,4,36,"At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counselors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me."
Daniel,4,37,"Now I N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] praise and extol (to lift up; to praise; to esteem) and honour the King of heaven, all whose works [are] truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase."
Daniel,5,1,"Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand."
Daniel,5,2,"Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] had taken out of the temple which [was] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink in it."
Daniel,5,3,"Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] which [was] at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them."
Daniel,5,4,"They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone."
Daniel,5,5,"In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote."
Daniel,5,6,"Then the king’s Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor) was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his waist were loosed, and his knees struck one against another."
Daniel,5,7,"The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , and the soothsayers. [And] the king spoke, and said to the wise [men] of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , Whosoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and [have] a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,8,"Then came in all the king’s wise [men] : but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof."
Daniel,5,9,"Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor) was changed in him, and his lords were astonished."
Daniel,5,10," [Now] the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house: [and] the queen spoke and said, O king, live forever: let not you i thoughts trouble you i , nor let you i Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor) be changed:"
Daniel,5,11,"There is a man in you i kingdom, in whom [is] the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of you i father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] you i father, the king, [I say] , you i father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Kasdim [clod-breakers], [and] soothsayers;"
Daniel,5,12,"Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Dani’el [God is Judge] , whom the king named Belt-shatzar [lord of the straitened (impeded or restricted; narrowed, distressed)’s treasure] : now let Dani’el [God is Judge] be called, and he will show the interpretation."
Daniel,5,13,"Then was Dani’el [God is Judge] brought in before the king. [And] the king spoke and said unto Dani’el [God is Judge], [Are] you i that Dani’el [God is Judge] , which [are] of the children of the captivity of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?"
Daniel,5,14,"I have even heard of you i , that the spirit of the gods [is] in you i , and [that] light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in you i."
Daniel,5,15,"And now the wise [men] , the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not show the interpretation of the thing:"
Daniel,5,16,"And I have heard of you i , that you i can make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if you i can read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, you i shall be clothed with scarlet, and [have] a chain of gold about you i neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,17,"Then Dani’el [God is Judge] answered and said before the king, Let you i gifts be to yourself, and give you i rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation."
Daniel,5,18,"O you i king, the most high God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] gave N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] you i father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:"
Daniel,5,19,"And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he killed; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down."
Daniel,5,20,"But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:"
Daniel,5,21,"And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling [was] with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ruled in the kingdom of men, and [that] he appoints over it whomsoever he will."
Daniel,5,22,"And you i his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled you i heart, though you i knew all this;"
Daniel,5,23,"But have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you i , and you i , and you i lords, you i wives, and you i concubines, have drunk wine in them; and you i have praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in whose hand you i breath [is] , and whose [are] all you i ways, have you i not glorified:"
Daniel,5,24,Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.
Daniel,5,25,"And this [is] the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN."
Daniel,5,26,"This [is] the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has numbered you i kingdom, and finished it."
Daniel,5,27,"TEKEL; you i are weighed in the balances, and are found wanting."
Daniel,5,28,"PERES; You 1s kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes [middle land] and Persians."
Daniel,5,29,"Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Dani’el [God is Judge] with scarlet, and [put] a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom."
Daniel,5,30,In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] slain.
Daniel,5,31,"And Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] the Median took the kingdom, [being] about threescore and two years old."
Daniel,6,1,"It pleased Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;"
Daniel,6,2,"And over these three presidents; of whom Dani’el [God is Judge] [was] first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage."
Daniel,6,3,"Then this Dani’el [God is Judge] was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit [was] in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm."
Daniel,6,4,"Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Dani’el [God is Judge] concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he [was] faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him."
Daniel,6,5,"Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Dani’el [God is Judge] , except we find [it] against him concerning the law of his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Daniel,6,6,"Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] , live forever."
Daniel,6,7,"All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counselors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] or man for thirty days, save of you i , O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions."
Daniel,6,8,"Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes [middle land] and Persians, which alters not."
Daniel,6,9,For what reason king Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] signed the writing and the decree.
Daniel,6,10,"Now when Dani’el [God is Judge] knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , as he did aforetime."
Daniel,6,11,"Then these men assembled, and found Dani’el [God is Judge] praying and making supplication before his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Daniel,6,12,"Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king’s decree; Have you i not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask [a petition] of any God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] or man within thirty days, save of you i , O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing [is] true, according to the law of the Medes [middle land] and Persians, which alters not."
Daniel,6,13,"Then answered they and said before the king, That Dani’el [God is Judge] , which [is] of the children of the captivity of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , regards not you i , O king, nor the decree that you i have signed, but makes his petition three times a day."
Daniel,6,14,"Then the king, when he heard [these] words, was sore displeased with himself, and set [his] heart on Dani’el [God is Judge] to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him."
Daniel,6,15,"Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes [middle land] and Persians [is] , That no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed."
Daniel,6,16,"Then the king commanded, and they brought Dani’el [God is Judge] , and cast [him] into the den of lions. [Now] the king spoke and said unto Dani’el [God is Judge] , You 1s God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] whom you i serve continually, he will deliver you i."
Daniel,6,17,"And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet (seal or stamp) , and with the signet (seal or stamp) of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Dani’el [God is Judge]."
Daniel,6,18,"Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep went from him."
Daniel,6,19,"Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions."
Daniel,6,20,"And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Dani’el [God is Judge]: [and] the king spoke and said to Dani’el [God is Judge] , O Dani’el [God is Judge] , servant of the living God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , is you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , whom you i serve continually, able to deliver you i from the lions?"
Daniel,6,21,"Then said Dani’el [God is Judge] unto the king, O king, live forever."
Daniel,6,22,"My God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has sent his angel, and has shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before you i , O king, have I done no hurt."
Daniel,6,23,"Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Dani’el [God is Judge] up out of the den. So Dani’el [God is Judge] was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Daniel,6,24,"And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Dani’el [God is Judge] , and they cast [them] into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den."
Daniel,6,25,"Then king Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you."
Daniel,6,26,"I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Dani’el [God is Judge] : for he [is] the living God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and steadfast forever, and his kingdom [that] which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion [shall be even] unto the end."
Daniel,6,27,"He delivers and rescues, and he works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who has delivered Dani’el [God is Judge] from the power of the lions."
Daniel,6,28,"So this Dani’el [God is Judge] prospered in the reign of Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] , and in the reign of Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] the Persian."
Daniel,7,1,"In the first year of Belshazzar king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] Dani’el [God is Judge] had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, [and] told the sum of the matters."
Daniel,7,2,"Dani’el [God is Judge] spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea."
Daniel,7,3,"And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another."
Daniel,7,4,"The first [was] like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it."
Daniel,7,5,"And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and [it had] three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh."
Daniel,7,6,"After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it."
Daniel,7,7,"After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue (part that remains, the rest) with the feet of it: and it [was] diverse from all the beasts that [were] before it; and it had ten horns."
Daniel,7,8,"I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn [were] eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things."
Daniel,7,9,"I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment [was] white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne [was like] the fiery flame, [and] his wheels [as] burning fire."
Daniel,7,10,"A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened."
Daniel,7,11,"I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke: I beheld [even] till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame."
Daniel,7,12,"As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time."
Daniel,7,13,"I saw in the night visions, and, behold, [one] like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him."
Daniel,7,14,"And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion [is] an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom [that] which shall not be destroyed."
Daniel,7,15,"I Dani’el [God is Judge] was grieved in my spirit in the midst of [my] body, and the visions of my head troubled me."
Daniel,7,16,"I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the tof all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things."
Daniel,7,17,"These great beasts, which are four, [are] four kings, [which] shall arise out of the earth."
Daniel,7,18,"But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever."
Daniel,7,19,"Then I would know the tof the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth [were of] iron, and his nails [of] brass; [which] devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue (part that remains, the rest) with his feet;"
Daniel,7,20,"And of the ten horns that [were] in his head, and [of] the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even [of] that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke very great things, whose look [was] more stout than his fellows."
Daniel,7,21,"I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;"
Daniel,7,22,"Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom."
Daniel,7,23,"Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall trample it down, and break it in pieces."
Daniel,7,24,"And the ten horns out of this kingdom [are] ten kings [that] shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings."
Daniel,7,25,"And he shall speak [great] words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time."
Daniel,7,26,"But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy [it] unto the end."
Daniel,7,27,"And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom [is] an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him."
Daniel,7,28,"Till this point in time [is] the end of the matter. As for me Dani’el [God is Judge] , my cogitations (thinking something over) much troubled me, and my Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor) changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart."
Daniel,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, [even unto] me Dani’el [God is Judge] , after that which appeared unto me at the first."
Daniel,8,2,"And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I [was] at Shushan [lily] [in] the palace, which [is] in the province of ‘Eilam [eternity] ; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai [my leaders]."
Daniel,8,3,"Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had [two] horns: and the [two] horns [were] high; but one [was] higher than the other, and the higher came up last."
Daniel,8,4,"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither [was there any] that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great."
Daniel,8,5,"And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat [had] a notable horn between his eyes."
Daniel,8,6,"And he came to the ram that had [two] horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power."
Daniel,8,7,"And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand."
Daniel,8,8,"Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven."
Daniel,8,9,"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant [land]."
Daniel,8,10,"And it waxed great, [even] to the army of heaven; and it cast down [some] of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them."
Daniel,8,11,"Yes, he magnified [himself] even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily [sacrifice] was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down."
Daniel,8,12,"And an host was given [him] against the daily [sacrifice] by reason of transgression, and it cast down the tto the ground; and it practiced, and prospered."
Daniel,8,13,"Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain [saint] which spoke, How long [shall be] the vision [concerning] the daily [sacrifice] , and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled under foot?"
Daniel,8,14,"And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evening morning (days) ; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."
Daniel,8,15,"And it came to pass, when I, [even] I Dani’el [God is Judge] , had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man."
Daniel,8,16,"And I heard a man’s voice between [the banks of] Ulai [my leaders] , which called, and said, Gabriel, make this [man] to understand the vision."
Daniel,8,17,"So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O Son of man: for at the time of the end [shall be] the vision."
Daniel,8,18,"Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright."
Daniel,8,19,"And he said, Behold, I will make you i know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end [shall be]."
Daniel,8,20,The ram which you i saw having [two] horns [are] the kings of Madai [middle land] and Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid].
Daniel,8,21,And the rough goat [is] the king of Greece: and the great horn that [is] between his eyes [is] the first king.
Daniel,8,22,"Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power."
Daniel,8,23,"And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor) , and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up."
Daniel,8,24,"And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practice, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people."
Daniel,8,25,"And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify [himself] in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand."
Daniel,8,26,And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told [is] true: wherefore shut you i up the vision; for it [shall be] for many days.
Daniel,8,27,"And I Dani’el [God is Judge] fainted, and was sick [certain] days; afterward I rose up, and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood [it]."
Daniel,9,1,"In the first year of Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] the son of Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] , of the seed of the Medes [middle land] , which was made king over the realm of the Kasdim [clod-breakers];"
Daniel,9,2,"In the first year of his reign I Dani’el [God is Judge] understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came to Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Daniel,9,3,"And I set my face unto the Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All Things] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:"
Daniel,9,4,"And I prayed unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elohai [The Living Word] (The Many Powered) , and made my confession, and said, O Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All Things] , the great and dreadful God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;"
Daniel,9,5,"We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from you i precepts and from you i judgments:"
Daniel,9,6,"Neither have we listened unto you i servants the prophets, which spoke in you i name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land."
Daniel,9,7,"O Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All Things] , righteousness [belongs] unto you i , but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and to the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and unto all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [that are] near, and [that are] far off, through all the countries to which you i have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against you i."
Daniel,9,8,"O Lord, to us [belongs] confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you i."
Daniel,9,9,"To the Lord our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [belong] mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;"
Daniel,9,10,"Neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets."
Daniel,9,11,"Yes, all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] have transgressed you i law, even by departing, that they might not obey you i voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that [is] written in the law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] the servant of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , because we have sinned against him."
Daniel,9,12,"And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven has not been done as has been done upon Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Daniel,9,13,"As [it is] written in the law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand you i truth."
Daniel,9,14,"Therefore has the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is] righteous in all his works which he does: for we obeyed not his voice."
Daniel,9,15,"And now, O Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All Things] , our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , that have brought you i people forth out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] with a mighty hand, and have gotten you i renown (great reputation; being well-known), as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly."
Daniel,9,16,"O Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All Things] , according to all you i righteousness, I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , let you i anger and you i fury be turned away from you i city Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , you i holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] and you i people [are become] a reproach (disgrace; shame) to all [that are] about us."
Daniel,9,17,"Now therefore, O our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , hear the prayer of you i servant, and his supplications, and cause you i face to shine upon you i sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s –Adonai’s (The Father) [Greatest Above All Things] sake."
Daniel,9,18,"O my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , incline you i ear, and hear; open you i eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by you i name: for we do not present our supplications before you i for our righteousnesses, but for you i great mercies."
Daniel,9,19,"O Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All Things] , hear; O Lord-Adonai (The Father), forgive; O Lord-Adonai (The Father) hearken and do; defer not, for your i own sake, O my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : for your i city and your i people are called by you i name."
Daniel,9,20,"And whiles I [was] speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and presenting my supplication before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] for the holy mountain of my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered];"
Daniel,9,21,"Yes, whiles I [was] speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation."
Daniel,9,22,"And he informed [me] , and talked with me, and said, O Dani’el [God is Judge] , I am now come forth to give you i skill and understanding."
Daniel,9,23,"At the beginning of you i supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to show [you i ] ; for you i [are] greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision."
Daniel,9,24,"Seventy weeks are determined upon you i people and upon you i holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy."
Daniel,9,25,"Know therefore and understand, [that] from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] unto the Messiah the Prince [shall be] seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times."
Daniel,9,26,"And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof [shall be] with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined."
Daniel,9,27,"And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make [it] desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate."
Daniel,10,1,"In the third year of Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] king of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] a thing was revealed unto Dani’el [God is Judge] , whose name was called Belt-shatzar [lord of the straitened (impeded or restricted; narrowed, distressed)’s treasure]; and the thing [was] true, but the time appointed [was] long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision."
Daniel,10,2,In those days I Dani’el [God is Judge] was mourning three full weeks.
Daniel,10,3,"I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled."
Daniel,10,4,"And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which [is] Khidekel (Tigris) [rapid];"
Daniel,10,5,"Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose waist [were] girded with fine gold of Ufaz [desire of fine gold]:"
Daniel,10,6,"His body also [was] like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude."
Daniel,10,7,"And I Dani’el [God is Judge] alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves."
Daniel,10,8,"Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength."
Daniel,10,9,"Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground."
Daniel,10,10,"And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and [upon] the palms of my hands."
Daniel,10,11,"And he said unto me, O Dani’el [God is Judge] , a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto you i , and stand upright: for unto you i am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling."
Daniel,10,12,"Then said he unto me, Fear not, Dani’el [God is Judge] : for from the first day that you i did set your i heart to understand, and to chasten yourself before you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , your i words were heard, and I am come for your i words."
Daniel,10,13,"But the prince of the kingdom of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Mikha’el [Who is Like God?] , one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid]."
Daniel,10,14,Now I am come to make you i understand what shall befall you i people in the latter days: for yet the vision [is] for [many] days.
Daniel,10,15,"And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb."
Daniel,10,16,"And, behold, [one] like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength."
Daniel,10,17,"For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me."
Daniel,10,18,"Then there came again and touched me [one] like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,"
Daniel,10,19,"And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace [be] unto you i , be strong, yes, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for you i have strengthened me."
Daniel,10,20,"Then said he, Know you i wherefore I come unto you i ? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] : and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come."
Daniel,10,21,"But I will show you i that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and [there is] none that holds with me in these things, but Mikha’el [Who is Like God?] your prince."
Daniel,11,1,"Also I in the first year of Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] the Mede, [even] I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him."
Daniel,11,2,"And now will I show you i the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] ; and the fourth shall be far richer than [they] all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece."
Daniel,11,3,"And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will."
Daniel,11,4,"And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those."
Daniel,11,5,"And the king of the south shall be strong, and [one] of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion [shall be] a great dominion."
Daniel,11,6,"And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) her, and he that strengthened her in [these] times."
Daniel,11,7,"But out of a branch of her roots shall [one] stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:"
Daniel,11,8,"And shall also carry captives into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] their gods, with their princes, [and] with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue [more] years than the king of the north."
Daniel,11,9,"So the king of the south shall come into [his] kingdom, and shall return into his own land."
Daniel,11,10,"But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and [one] shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, [even] to his fortress."
Daniel,11,11,"And the king of the south shall be moved with anger, and shall come forth and fight with him, [even] with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand."
Daniel,11,12," [And] when he has taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down [many] ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened [by it]."
Daniel,11,13,"For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches."
Daniel,11,14,And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of you i people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.
Daniel,11,15,"So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither [shall there be any] strength that is to withstand."
Daniel,11,16,"But he that comes against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed."
Daniel,11,17,"He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand [on his side] , neither be for him."
Daniel,11,18,"After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach (disgrace; shame) offered by him to cease; without his own reproach (disgrace; shame) he shall cause [it] to turn upon him."
Daniel,11,19,"Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found."
Daniel,11,20,"Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes [in] the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle."
Daniel,11,21,"And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries."
Daniel,11,22,"And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yes, also the prince of the covenant."
Daniel,11,23,"And after the league [made] with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people."
Daniel,11,24,"He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do [that] which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil (plunder; prey; booty) , and riches: [yes] , and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time."
Daniel,11,25,And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.
Daniel,11,26,"Yes, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain."
Daniel,11,27,"And both these kings’ hearts [shall be] to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end [shall be] at the time appointed."
Daniel,11,28,"Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart [shall be] against the holy covenant; and he shall do [exploits] , and return to his own land."
Daniel,11,29,"At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter."
Daniel,11,30,"For the ships of Kittim [Bruisers] shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant."
Daniel,11,31,"And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily [sacrifice] , and they shall place the abomination that makes desolate."
Daniel,11,32,"And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shall be strong, and do [exploits]."
Daniel,11,33,"And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil (plunder; prey; booty), [many] days."
Daniel,11,34,"Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help: but many shall cleave (split open; cut open; divide) to them with flatteries."
Daniel,11,35,"And [some] of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make [them] white, [even] to the time of the end: because [it is] yet for a time appointed."
Daniel,11,36,"And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvelous things against the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done."
Daniel,11,37,"Neither shall he regard the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all."
Daniel,11,38,"But in his estate shall he honour the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things."
Daniel,11,39,"Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge [and] increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain."
Daniel,11,40,"And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over."
Daniel,11,41,"He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many [countries] shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, [even] Edom [Red] , and Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , and the chief of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred]."
Daniel,11,42,He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] shall not escape.
Daniel,11,43,"But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : and the Libyans and the Cushi [Ethiopians] [shall be] at his steps."
Daniel,11,44,"But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many."
Daniel,11,45,"And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him."
Daniel,12,1,"And at that time shall Mikha’el [Who is Like God?] stand up, the great prince which stands for the children of you i people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation [even] to that same time: and at that time you i people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book."
Daniel,12,2,"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame [and] everlasting contempt."
Daniel,12,3,And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the Firmament (expanse or vault over the earth) ; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.
Daniel,12,4,"But you i , O Dani’el [God is Judge] , shut up the words, and seal the book, [even] to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased."
Daniel,12,5,"Then I Dani’el [God is Judge] looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river."
Daniel,12,6,"And [one] said to the man clothed in linen, which [was] upon the waters of the river, How long [shall it be to] the end of these wonders?"
Daniel,12,7,"And I heard the man clothed in linen, which [was] upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and swore by him that lives forever that [it shall be] for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these [things] shall be finished."
Daniel,12,8,"And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord-Adon (Lord of the Earth) , what [shall be] the end of these [things]?"
Daniel,12,9,"And he said, Go you i way, Dani’el [God is Judge] : for the words [are] closed up and sealed till the time of the end."
Daniel,12,10,"Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand."
Daniel,12,11,"And from the time [that] the daily [sacrifice] shall be taken away, and the abomination that makes desolate set up, [there shall be] a thousand two hundred and ninety days."
Daniel,12,12,"Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [is] he that waits, and comes to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days."
Daniel,12,13,"But go you i your i way till the end [be] : for you i shall rest, and stand in your i lot at the end of the days."
