Joel,1,1,The word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) that came to Yo’el [Yehovah is God] the son of P’tu’el [vision of God].
Joel,1,2,"Hear this, you 2f old men, and give ear, all you 2f inhabitants of the land. Has this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?"
Joel,1,3,"Tell you 2f your children of it, and [let] your children [tell] their children, and their children another generation."
Joel,1,4,That which the palmerworm has left has the locust eaten; and that which the locust has left has the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm has left has the caterpillar eaten.
Joel,1,5,"Awake, you 2f drunkards, and weep; and howl, all you 2f drinkers of wine, because of the New Wine; for it is cut off from your mouth."
Joel,1,6,"For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth [are] the teeth of a lion, and he has the cheek teeth of a great lion."
Joel,1,7,"He has laid my vine waste, and barked (scraped the bark off) my fig tree: he has made it clean bore, and cast [it] away; the branches thereof are made white."
Joel,1,8,Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
Joel,1,9,"The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; the priests, the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] ministers, mourn."
Joel,1,10,"The field is wasted, the land mourns; for the corn is wasted: the New Wine is dried up, the oil languishes."
Joel,1,11,"Be you 2f ashamed, O you 2f husbandmen; howl, O you 2f vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished."
Joel,1,12,"The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languishes; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, [even] all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men."
Joel,1,13,"Gird yourselves, and lament, you 2f priests: howl, you 2f ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, you 2f ministers of my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : for the meat offering and the drink offering is withheld from the house of your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Joel,1,14,"Sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) you 2f a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders [and] all the inhabitants of the land [into] the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and cry unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate),"
Joel,1,15,"Alas for the day! for the day of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come."
Joel,1,16,"Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, [yes] , joy and gladness from the house of our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]?"
Joel,1,17,"The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered."
Joel,1,18,"How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate."
Joel,1,19,"O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to you i will I cry: for the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame has burned all the trees of the field."
Joel,1,20,"The beasts of the field cry also unto you i : for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness."
Joel,2,1,"Blow you 2f the trumpet in Tziyon [parched place] , and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) comes, for [it is] near at hand;"
Joel,2,2,"A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there has not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, [even] to the years of many generations."
Joel,2,3,"A fire devours before them; and behind them a flame burns: the land [is] as the garden of ‘Eden [pleasure] before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yes, and nothing shall escape them."
Joel,2,4,"The appearance of them [is] as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run."
Joel,2,5,"Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array (to put on; to clothe)."
Joel,2,6,Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.
Joel,2,7,"They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march everyone on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:"
Joel,2,8,"Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk everyone in his path: and [when] they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded."
Joel,2,9,"They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief."
Joel,2,10,"The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:"
Joel,2,11,And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp [is] very great: for [he is] strong that executes his word: for the day of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] great and very terrible; and who can abide it?
Joel,2,12,"Therefore also now, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , turn you 2f [even] to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:"
Joel,2,13,"And rend (tear apart; forcefully rip apart) your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : for he [is] gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repents him of the evil."
Joel,2,14,"Who knows [if] he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; [even] a meat offering and a drink offering unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]?"
Joel,2,15,"Blow the trumpet in Tziyon [parched place] , sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) a fast, call a solemn assembly:"
Joel,2,16,"Gather the people, sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet."
Joel,2,17,"Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare you i people, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and give not your i heritage to reproach (disgrace; shame) , that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where [is] their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]?"
Joel,2,18,"Then will the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) be jealous for his land, and pity his people."
Joel,2,19,"Yes, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and you 2f shall be satisfied with that: and I will no more make you a reproach (disgrace; shame) among the heathen:"
Joel,2,20,"But I will remove far off from you the northern [army] , and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he has done great things."
Joel,2,21,"Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will do great things."
Joel,2,22,"Be not afraid, you 2f beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree bears her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength."
Joel,2,23,"Be glad then, you 2f children of Tziyon [parched place] , and rejoice in the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : for he has given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first [month]."
Joel,2,24,"And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil."
Joel,2,25,"And I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you."
Joel,2,26,"And you 2f shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , that has dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed."
Joel,2,27,"And you 2f shall know that I [am] in the midst of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and [that] I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed."
Joel,2,28,"And it shall come to pass afterward, [that] I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:"
Joel,2,29,And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.
Joel,2,30,"And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke."
Joel,2,31,"The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) come."
Joel,2,32,"And it shall come to pass, [that] whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall be delivered: for in mount Tziyon [parched place] and in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] shall be deliverance, as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has said, and in the remnant whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall call."
Joel,3,1,"For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace],"
Joel,3,2,"I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] , and will plead with them there for my people and [for] my heritage Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land."
Joel,3,3,"And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an prostitute, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink."
Joel,3,4,"Yes, and what have you 2f to do with me, O Tzor [a rock] , and Tzidon [Hunting] , and all the coasts of Palestine? will you 2f render me a recompense? and if you 2f recompense me, swiftly [and] speedily will I return your recompense upon your own head;"
Joel,3,5,"Because you 2f have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things:"
Joel,3,6,"The children also of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and the children of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] have you 2f sold unto the Grecians, that you 2f might remove them far from their border."
Joel,3,7,"Behold, I will raise them out of the place to which you 2f have sold them, and will return your recompense upon your own head:"
Joel,3,8,"And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and they shall sell them to the S’va [drunkards] , to a people far off: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has spoken [it]."
Joel,3,9,"Proclaim you 2f this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:"
Joel,3,10,"Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I [am] strong."
Joel,3,11,"Assemble yourselves, and come, all you 2f heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: there cause you i mighty ones to come down, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Joel,3,12,"Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] : for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about."
Joel,3,13,"Put you 2f in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness [is] great."
Joel,3,14,"Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] near in the valley of decision."
Joel,3,15,"The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining."
Joel,3,16,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) also shall roar out of Tziyon [parched place] , and utter his voice from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [will be] the hope of his people, and the strength of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joel,3,17,"So shall you 2f know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] dwelling in Tziyon [parched place] , my holy mountain: then shall Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more."
Joel,3,18,"And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the mountains shall drop down New Wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and shall water the valley of Sheetim [The Acacias]."
Joel,3,19,"Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] shall be a desolation, and Edom [Red] shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence [against] the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , because they have shed innocent blood in their land."
Joel,3,20,"But Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] shall dwell forever, and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] from generation to generation."
Joel,3,21,For I will cleanse their blood [that] I have not cleansed: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) dwells in Tziyon [parched place].
