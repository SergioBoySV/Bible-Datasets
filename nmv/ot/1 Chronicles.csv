1 Chronicles,17,6,"Wheresoever I have walked with all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , spoke I a word to any of the of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have you 2f not built me an house of cedars?"
1 Chronicles,17,7,"Now therefore thus shall you i say unto my servant David [beloved] , Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , I took you i from the stable, [even] from following the sheep, that you i should be ruler over my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]:"

1 Chronicles,17,17,"And [yet] this was a small thing in you i eyes, O God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; for you i have [also] spoken of you i servant’s house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."

1 Chronicles,18,1,"Now after this it came to pass, that David [beloved] struck the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and subdued them, and took Gat [Winepress] and her towns out of the hand of the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."

1 Chronicles,18,6,"Then David [beloved] put [garrisons] in Aram [exalted] in Dammesek; and the Aram [exalted] [Syrians] became David’s [beloved] ’s servants, [and] brought gifts. Thus the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) preserved David [beloved] to wherever he went."

1 Chronicles,18,9,Now when To’u [wander] king of Hamat [Fortress] heard how David [beloved] had smitten all the host of Hadad’ezer [mighty helps] king of Tzovah [station];
1 Chronicles,18,10,"He sent Hadoram [noble honour] his son to king David [beloved] , to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadad’ezer [mighty helps] [Hadad [mighty] is help] , and smitten him; (for Hadad’ezer [mighty helps] had war with To’u [wander];) and [with him] all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass."
1 Chronicles,18,11,"Them also king David [beloved] dedicated unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , with the silver and the gold that he brought from all [these] nations; from Edom [Red] , and from Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , and from the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , and from the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and from ‘Amalek [Dweller in a Valley]."
1 Chronicles,18,12,Moreover Avishai [my father is a gift] the son of Tz’ruyah [balsam] killed of the Edomi [red] in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.
1 Chronicles,18,13,And he put garrisons in Edom [Red] ; and all the Edomi [red] became David’s [beloved] ’s servants. Thus the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) preserved David [beloved] to wherever he went.
1 Chronicles,18,14,"So David [beloved] reigned over all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and executed judgment and justice among all his people."

1 Chronicles,18,17,And B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] [was] over the K’reti [executioners] and the P’leti [couriers] ; and the sons of David [beloved] [were] chief about the king.
1 Chronicles,19,1,"Now it came to pass after this, that Nachash [serpent] the king of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] died, and his son reigned in his stead."
1 Chronicles,19,2,"And David [beloved] said, I will show kindness unto Hanun [gracious] the son of Nachash [serpent] , because his father showed kindness to me. And David [beloved] sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David [beloved] came into the land of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] to Hanun [gracious] , to comfort him."
1 Chronicles,19,3,"But the princes of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] said to Hanun [gracious] , Think you i that David [beloved] does honour you i father, that he has sent comforters unto you i ? are not his servants come unto you i for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?"
1 Chronicles,19,4,"For what reason Hanun [gracious] took David’s [beloved] ’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst beside their buttocks, and sent them away."
1 Chronicles,19,5,"Then there went [certain] , and told David [beloved] how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Yericho [Its Moon] until your beards be grown, and [then] return."
1 Chronicles,19,6,"And when the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] saw that they had made themselves odious to David [beloved] , Hanun [gracious] and the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Aram [Elevated Between the Two Rivers] and out of Aram-Ma’akhah [exalted oppression] , and out of Tzovah [station]."
1 Chronicles,19,7,"So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Ma’akhah [oppression] and his people; who came and pitched before Meidva [Water of Rest] . And the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle."
1 Chronicles,19,8,"And when David [beloved] heard [of it] , he sent Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , and all the host of the mighty men."
1 Chronicles,19,9,"And the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] came out, and put the battle in array (to put on; to clothe) before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come [were] by themselves in the field."
1 Chronicles,19,10,"Now when Yo’av [Yehovah is father] saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and put [them] in array (to put on; to clothe) against the Aram [exalted] [Syrians]."
1 Chronicles,19,11,"And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Avishai [my father is a gift] his brother, and they set [themselves] in array (to put on; to clothe) against the children of ‘Amon [Inbred]."
1 Chronicles,19,12,"And he said, If the Aram [exalted] [Syrians] be too strong for me, then you i shall help me: but if the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] be too strong for you i , then I will help you i."
1 Chronicles,19,13,"Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : and let the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) do [that which is] good in his sight."
1 Chronicles,19,14,So Yo’av [Yehovah is father] and the people that [were] with him drew near before the Aram [exalted] [Syrians] unto the battle; and they fled before him.
1 Chronicles,19,15,"And when the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] saw that the Aram [exalted] [Syrians] were fled, they likewise fled before Avishai [my father is a gift] his brother, and entered into the city. Then Yo’av [Yehovah is father] came to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
1 Chronicles,19,16,"And when the Aram [exalted] [Syrians] saw that they were put to the worse before Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , they sent messengers, and drew forth the Aram [exalted] [Syrians] that [were] beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadad’ezer [mighty helps] [went] before them."
1 Chronicles,19,17,"And it was told David [beloved] ; and he gathered all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and passed over Yarden [Descender] , and came upon them, and set [the battle] in array (to put on; to clothe) against them. So when David [beloved] had put the battle in array (to put on; to clothe) against the Aram [exalted] [Syrians] , they fought with him."
1 Chronicles,19,18,"But the Aram [exalted] [Syrians] fled before Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and David [beloved] killed of the Aram [exalted] [Syrians] seven thousand [men which fought in] chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shofakh [expansion] the captain of the host."
1 Chronicles,19,19,"And when the servants of Hadad’ezer [mighty helps] saw that they were put to the worse before Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , they made peace with David [beloved] , and became his servants: neither would the Aram [exalted] [Syrians] help the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] any more."
1 Chronicles,20,1,"And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out [to battle] , Yo’av [Yehovah is father] led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , and came and besieged Rabbah [Great] . But David [beloved] tarried at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] struck Rabbah [Great] , and destroyed it."
1 Chronicles,20,2,"And David [beloved] took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent (weight of money; weight; gift) of gold, and [there were] precious stones in it; and it was set upon David’s [beloved] ’s head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil (plunder; prey; booty) out of the city."
1 Chronicles,20,3,"And he brought out the people that [were] in it, and cut [them] with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David [beloved] with all the cities of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] . And David [beloved] and all the people returned to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
1 Chronicles,20,4,"And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer [Portion] with the P’lishtim [Immigrants] ; at which time Sibkhai [weaver] the Hushati [meaning unknown] killed Sippai, [that was] of the children of the giant: and they were subdued."
1 Chronicles,20,5,"And there was war again with the P’lishtim [Immigrants] ; and Elchanan [God has been gracious] the son of Ya’ir [He Enlightens] killed Lachmi [my bread] the brother of Golyat [splendour] the Gitti [belonging to Gat (winepress)] , whose spear staff [was] like a weaver’s beam."
1 Chronicles,20,6,"And yet again there was war at Gat [Winepress] , where was a man of [great] stature, whose fingers and toes [were] four and twenty, six [on each hand] , and six [on each foot] : and he also was the son of the giant."
1 Chronicles,20,7,"But when he defied Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] the son of Shim’a [fame] David’s [beloved] ’s brother killed him."
1 Chronicles,20,8,"These were born unto the giant in Gat [Winepress] ; and they fell by the hand of David [beloved] , and by the hand of his servants."
1 Chronicles,21,1,"And Satan stood up against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and provoked David [beloved] to number Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Chronicles,21,2,"And David [beloved] said to Yo’av [Yehovah is father] and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] from Be’er-sheva [Well of the sevenfold Oath] even to Dan [Judge] ; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know [it]."
1 Chronicles,21,3,"And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] answered, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) make his people an hundred times so many more as they [be] : but, my lord the king, [are] they not all my lord’s servants? why then does my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
1 Chronicles,21,4,"Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Yo’av [Yehovah is father] . For what reason Yo’av [Yehovah is father] departed, and went throughout all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and came to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
1 Chronicles,21,5,And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] gave the sum of the number of the people unto David [beloved] . And all [they of] Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] [was] four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.
1 Chronicles,21,6,"But Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] and Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] counted he not among them: for the king’s word was abominable to Yo’av [Yehovah is father]."
1 Chronicles,21,7,And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
1 Chronicles,21,8,"And David [beloved] said unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , do away the iniquity of you i servant; for I have done very foolishly."
1 Chronicles,21,9,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] , David’s [beloved] ’s seer, saying,"
1 Chronicles,21,10,"Go and tell David [beloved] , saying, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , I offer you i three [things] : choose you i one of them, that I may do [it] unto you i."
1 Chronicles,21,11,"So Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] came to David [beloved] , and said unto him, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Choose you i"
1 Chronicles,21,12,"Either three years’ famine; or three months to be destroyed before your i foes, while that the sword of your i enemies overtake [you i ] ; or else three days the sword of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) destroying throughout all the coasts of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] . Now therefore advise yourself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me."
1 Chronicles,21,13,"And David [beloved] said unto Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] , I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; for very great [are] his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man."
1 Chronicles,21,14,So the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent pestilence upon Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and there fell of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] seventy thousand men.
1 Chronicles,21,15,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] sent an angel unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now you i hand. And the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan [light was perpetuated] the Y’vusi [Threshers]."
1 Chronicles,21,16,"And David [beloved] lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . Then David [beloved] and the elders [of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], who were] clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces."
1 Chronicles,21,17,"And David [beloved] said unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered], [Is it] not I [that] commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but [as for] these sheep, what have they done? let you i hand, I pray you i , O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , be on me, and on my father’s house; but not on you i people, that they should be plagued."
1 Chronicles,21,18,"Then the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] to say to David [beloved] , that David [beloved] should go up, and set up an altar unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in the threshingfloor of Ornan [light was perpetuated] the Y’vusi [Threshers]."
1 Chronicles,21,19,"And David [beloved] went up at the saying of Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] , which he spoke in the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Chronicles,21,20,"And Ornan [light was perpetuated] turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan [light was perpetuated] was threshing wheat."
1 Chronicles,21,21,"And as David [beloved] came to Ornan [light was perpetuated] , Ornan [light was perpetuated] looked and saw David [beloved] , and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David [beloved] with [his] face to the ground."
1 Chronicles,21,22,"Then David [beloved] said to Ornan [light was perpetuated] , Grant me the place of [this] threshingfloor, that I may build an altar in it unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : you i shall grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be detained (held) from the people."
1 Chronicles,21,23,"And Ornan [light was perpetuated] said unto David [beloved] , Take [it] to you i , and let my lord the king do [that which is] good in his eyes: lo, I give [you i ] the oxen [also] for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all."
1 Chronicles,21,24,"And king David [beloved] said to Ornan [light was perpetuated] , No; but I will truly buy it for the full price: for I will not take [that] which [is] you i for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , nor offer burnt offerings without cost."
1 Chronicles,21,25,So David [beloved] gave to Ornan [light was perpetuated] for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
1 Chronicles,21,26,"And David [beloved] built there an altar unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering."
1 Chronicles,21,27,And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.
1 Chronicles,21,28,"At that time when David [beloved] saw that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan [light was perpetuated] the Y’vusi [Threshers] , then he sacrificed there."
1 Chronicles,21,29,"For the tabernacle of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, [were] at that season in the high place at Giv’on [Hill City]."
