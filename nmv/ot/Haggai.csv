Haggai,1,1,"In the second year of Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) by Hagai [festive] the prophet unto Z’rubavel [sown in Babylon] the son of Sh’alti’el [I have asked of God] , governor of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and to Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Y’hotzadak [Yehovah is righteous] , the High Priest, saying,"
Haggai,1,2,"Thus speaks the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] house (Temple) should be built."
Haggai,1,3,"Then came the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) by Hagai [festive] the prophet, saying,"
Haggai,1,4," [Is it] time for you, O you 2f , to dwell in your ceilinged houses, and this house [lie] waste?"
Haggai,1,5,Now therefore thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; Consider your ways.
Haggai,1,6,"You 2f have sown much, and bring in little; you 2f eat, but you 2f have not enough; you 2f drink, but you 2f are not filled with drink; you 2f clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earns wages earns wages [to put it] into a bag with holes."
Haggai,1,7,Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; Consider your ways.
Haggai,1,8,"Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Haggai,1,9,"You 2f looked for much, and, lo, [it came] to little; and when you 2f brought [it] home, I did blow upon it. Why? says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] . Because of my house that [is] waste, and you 2f run every man unto his own house."
Haggai,1,10,"Therefore the heaven over you is detained (held) from dew, and the earth is detained (held) [from] her fruit."
Haggai,1,11,"And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the New Wine, and upon the oil, and upon [that] which the ground brings forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands."
Haggai,1,12,"Then Z’rubavel [sown in Babylon] the son of Sh’alti’el [I have asked of God] , and Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Y’hotzadak [Yehovah is righteous] , the High Priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and the words of Hagai [festive] the prophet, as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had sent him, and the people did fear before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Haggai,1,13,"Then spoke Hagai [festive] the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] messenger in the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] message unto the people, saying, I [am] with you, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Haggai,1,14,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) stirred up the spirit of Z’rubavel [sown in Babylon] the son of Sh’alti’el [I have asked of God] , governor of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and the spirit of Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Y’hotzadak [Yehovah is righteous] , the High Priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered],"
Haggai,1,15,"In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] the king."
Haggai,2,1,"In the seventh [month] , in the one and twentieth [day] of the month, came the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) by the prophet Hagai [festive] , saying,"
Haggai,2,2,"Speak now to Z’rubavel [sown in Babylon] the son of Sh’alti’el [I have asked of God] , governor of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and to Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Y’hotzadak [Yehovah is righteous] , the High Priest, and to the residue (part that remains, the rest) of the people, saying,"
Haggai,2,3,Who [is] left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do you 2f see it now? [is it] not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?
Haggai,2,4,"Yet now be strong, O Z’rubavel [sown in Babylon] , says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and be strong, O Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , son of Y’hotzadak [Yehovah is righteous] , the High Priest; and be strong, all you 2f people of the land, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and work: for I [am] with you, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]:"
Haggai,2,5," [According to] the word that I covenanted with you when you 2f came out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , so my spirit remains among you: fear you 2f not."
Haggai,2,6,"For thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; Yet once, it [is] a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry [land];"
Haggai,2,7,"And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with Glory, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Haggai,2,8,"The silver [is] my, and the gold [is] my, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Haggai,2,9,"The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] : and in this place will I give peace, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Haggai,2,10,"In the four and twentieth [day] of the ninth [month] , in the second year of Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] , came the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) by Hagai [festive] the prophet, saying,"
Haggai,2,11,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; Ask now the priests [concerning] the law, saying,"
Haggai,2,12,"If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No."
Haggai,2,13,"Then said Hagai [festive] , If [one that is] unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean."
Haggai,2,14,"Then answered Hagai [festive] , and said, So [is] this people, and so [is] this nation before me, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and so [is] every work of their hands; and that which they offer there [is] unclean."
Haggai,2,15,"And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):"
Haggai,2,16,"Since those [days] were, when [one] came to an heap of twenty [measures] , there were [but] ten: when [one] came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty [vessels] out of the press, there were [but] twenty."
Haggai,2,17,"I struck you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet you 2f [turned] not to me, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Haggai,2,18,"Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth [month, even] from the day that the foundation of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] temple was laid, consider [it]."
Haggai,2,19,"Is the seed yet in the barn? yes, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, has not brought forth: from this day will I bless [you]."
Haggai,2,20,"And again the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto Hagai [festive] in the four and twentieth [day] of the month, saying,"
Haggai,2,21,"Speak to Z’rubavel [sown in Babylon] , governor of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;"
Haggai,2,22,"And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, everyone by the sword of his brother."
Haggai,2,23,"In that day, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , will I take you i , O Z’rubavel [sown in Babylon] , my servant, the son of Sh’alti’el [I have asked of God] , says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and will make you i as a signet (seal or stamp) : for I have chosen you i , says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
