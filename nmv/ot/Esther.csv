Esther,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the days of Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] , (this [is] Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia [Kush], [over] an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)"
Esther,1,2," [That] in those days, when the king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] sat on the throne of his kingdom, which [was] in Shushan [lily] the capitol,"
Esther,1,3,"In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] and Madai [middle land] , the nobles and princes of the provinces, [being] before him:"
Esther,1,4,"When he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, [even] an hundred and eighty days."
Esther,1,5,"And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan [lily] the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace;"
Esther,1,6," [Where were] white, green, and blue, [hangings] , fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds [were of] gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble."
Esther,1,7,"And they gave [them] drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king."
Esther,1,8,"And the drinking [was] according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure."
Esther,1,9,Also Vashti [beautiful] the Queen made a feast for the women [in] the royal house which [belonged] to king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor].
Esther,1,10,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman [faithful] , Bizta [booty] , Harvona [ass-driver] , Bigta [in the winepress] , and Avagta [God-given] , Zetar [star] , and Karkas [severe] , the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] the king,"
Esther,1,11,"To bring Vashti [beautiful] the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the people and the princes her beauty: for she [was] fair to look on."
Esther,1,12,"But the queen Vashti [beautiful] refused to come at the king’s commandment by [his] chamberlains: therefore was the king very exceedingly angry, and his anger burned in him."
Esther,1,13,"Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so [was] the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment:"
Esther,1,14,"And the next unto him [was] Karshna [illustrious] , Shetar [a star] , Admata [a testimony to them] , Tarshish [yellow jasper] , Meres [lofty] , Marsna [worthy], [and] Memukhan [dignified] , the seven princes of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] and Madai [middle land] , which saw the king’s face, [and] which sat the first in the kingdom;)"
Esther,1,15,"What shall we do unto the queen Vashti [beautiful] according to law, because she has not performed the commandment of the king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] by the chamberlains?"
Esther,1,16,"And Memukhan [dignified] answered before the king and the princes, Vashti [beautiful] the queen has not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that [are] in all the provinces of the king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor]."
Esther,1,17,"For [this] deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] commanded Vashti [beautiful] the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not."
Esther,1,18," [Likewise] shall the ladies of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] and Madai [middle land] say this day unto all the king’s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus [shall there arise] too much contempt and wrath."
Esther,1,19,"If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes [middle land] , that it be not altered, That Vashti [beautiful] come no more before king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] ; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she."
Esther,1,20,"And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small."
Esther,1,21,And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memukhan [dignified]:
Esther,1,22,"For he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that [it] should be published according to the language of every people."
Esther,2,1,"After these things, when the wrath of king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] was appeased, he remembered Vashti [beautiful] , and what she had done, and what was decreed against her."
Esther,2,2,"Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:"
Esther,2,3,"And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan [lily] the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai [eunuch] the king’s Chamberlain (eunuch or chief servant; one in charge of the king’s quarters), keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given [them]:"
Esther,2,4,And let the virgin which pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti [beautiful] . And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
Esther,2,5," [Now] in Shushan [lily] the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name [was] Mordekhai [little man] , the son of Ya’ir [He Enlightens] , the son of Shime’i [Fame] , the son of Kish [bent] , from the tribe of Binyamin [A Son of the Right Hand];"
Esther,2,6,"Who had been carried away from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] with the captivity which had been carried away with Y’khanyahu [Yehovah will establish] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , whom N’vukhadnetzar the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] had carried away."
Esther,2,7,"And he brought up Hadassah, that [is] , Ester [star] , his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid [was] fair and beautiful; whom Mordekhai [little man] , when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter."
Esther,2,8,"So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan [lily] the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Ester [star] was brought also unto the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women."
Esther,2,9,"And the virgin pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, [which were] meet to be given her, out of the king’s house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best [place] of the house of the women."
Esther,2,10,Ester [star] had not showed her people nor her family: for Mordekhai [little man] had charged her that she should not show [it].
Esther,2,11,"And Mordekhai [little man] walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Ester [star] did, and what should become of her."
Esther,2,12,"Now when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] , after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, [that is to say] , six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with [other] things for the purifying of the women;)"
Esther,2,13,Then thus came [every] virgin unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s house.
Esther,2,14,"In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Sha’ashgaz [servant of the beautiful] , the king’s Chamberlain (eunuch or chief servant; one in charge of the king’s quarters), which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name."
Esther,2,15,"Now when the turn of Ester [star] , the daughter of Avichayil [Father of Strength] the uncle of Mordekhai [little man] , who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s Chamberlain (eunuch or chief servant; one in charge of the king’s quarters) , the keeper of the women, appointed. And Ester [star] obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her."
Esther,2,16,"So Ester [star] was taken unto king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] into his house royal in the tenth month, which [is] the month Tevet [goodness] , in the seventh year of his reign."
Esther,2,17,"And the king loved Ester [star] above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti [beautiful]."
Esther,2,18,"Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, [even] Ester [star] ’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king."
Esther,2,19,"And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordekhai [little man] sat in the king’s gate."
Esther,2,20,"Ester [star] had not [yet] showed her family nor her people; as Mordekhai [little man] had charged her: for Ester [star] did the commandment of Mordekhai [little man] , like as when she was brought up with him."
Esther,2,21,"In those days, while Mordekhai [little man] sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigtan [in their winepress] and Teresh [strictness] , of those which kept the door, were exceedingly angry, and sought to lay hand on the king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor]."
Esther,2,22,"And the thing was known to Mordekhai [little man] , who told [it] unto Ester [star] the queen; and Ester [star] certified the king [thereof] in Mordekhai [little man] ’s name."
Esther,2,23,"And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king."
Esther,3,1,"After these things did king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] promote Haman [magnificent] the son of Hamdata [double] the Agagi [I will overtop] , and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that [were] with him."
Esther,3,2,"And all the king’s servants, that [were] in the king’s gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman [magnificent] : for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordekhai [little man] bowed not, nor did [him] reverence."
Esther,3,3,"Then the king’s servants, which [were] in the king’s gate, said unto Mordekhai [little man] , Why transgress you i the king’s commandment?"
Esther,3,4,"Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily unto him, and he listened not unto them, that they told Haman [magnificent] , to see whether Mordekhai [little man] ’s matters would stand: for he had told them that he [was] a Jew."
Esther,3,5,"And when Haman [magnificent] saw that Mordekhai [little man] bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman [magnificent] full of wrath."
Esther,3,6,"And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordekhai [little man] alone; for they had showed him the people of Mordekhai [little man] : wherefore Haman [magnificent] sought to destroy all the Y’hudim (Judeans) that [were] throughout the whole kingdom of Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor], [even] the people of Mordekhai [little man]."
Esther,3,7,"In the first month, that [is] , the month Nisan [their flight] , in the twelfth year of king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] , they cast Pur [lot] , that [is] , the lot, before Haman [magnificent] from day to day, and from month to month, [to] the twelfth [month] , that [is] , the month Adar."
Esther,3,8,"And Haman [magnificent] said unto king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] , There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of you i kingdom; and their laws [are] diverse from all people; neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it [is] not for the king’s profit to suffer them."
Esther,3,9,"If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring [it] into the king’s treasuries."
Esther,3,10,"And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman [magnificent] the son of Hamdata [double] the Agagi [I will overtop] , the Y’hudit (Y’hudim (Judeans)’) enemy."
Esther,3,11,"And the king said unto Haman [magnificent] , The silver [is] given to you i , the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you i."
Esther,3,12,"Then were the king’s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman [magnificent] had commanded unto the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors that [were] over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and [to] every people after their language; in the name of king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] was it written, and sealed with the king’s ring."
Esther,3,13,"And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Y’hudim (Judeans) , both young and old, little children and women, in one day, [even] upon the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and [to take] the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) of them for a prey."
Esther,3,14,"The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day."
Esther,3,15,"The posts went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan [lily] the palace. And the king and Haman [magnificent] sat down to drink; but the city Shushan [lily] was perplexed."
Esther,4,1,"When Mordekhai [little man] perceived all that was done, Mordekhai [little man] rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;"
Esther,4,2,And came even before the king’s gate: for none [might] enter into the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.
Esther,4,3,"And in every province, to wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, [there was] great mourning among the Y’hudim (Judeans) , and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes."
Esther,4,4,"So Ester [star] ’s maids and her chamberlains came and told [it] her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent clothing to clothe Mordekhai [little man] , and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received [it] not."
Esther,4,5,"Then called Ester [star] for Hatakh [truly], [one] of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordekhai [little man] , to know what it [was] , and why it [was]."
Esther,4,6,"So Hatakh [truly] went forth to Mordekhai [little man] unto the street of the city, which [was] before the king’s gate."
Esther,4,7,"And Mordekhai [little man] told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman [magnificent] had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Y’hudim (Judeans) , to destroy them."
Esther,4,8,"Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan [lily] to destroy them, to show [it] unto Ester [star] , and to declare [it] unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people."
Esther,4,9,And Hatakh [truly] came and told Ester [star] the words of Mordekhai [little man].
Esther,4,10,"Again Ester [star] spoke unto Hatakh [truly] , and gave him commandment unto Mordekhai [little man];"
Esther,4,11,"All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, [there is] one law of his to put [him] to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days."
Esther,4,12,And they told to Mordekhai [little man] Ester [star] ’s words.
Esther,4,13,"Then Mordekhai [little man] commanded to answer Ester [star] , Think not with yourself that you i shall escape in the king’s house, more than all the Y’hudim (Judeans)."
Esther,4,14,"For if you i altogether hold you i peace at this time, [then] shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Y’hudim (Judeans) from another place; but you i and you i father’s house shall be destroyed: and who knows whether you i are come to the kingdom for [such] a time as this?"
Esther,4,15,"Then Ester [star] bade [them] return Mordekhai [little man] [this answer],"
Esther,4,16,"Go, gather together all the Y’hudim (Judeans) that are present in Shushan [lily] , and fast you 2f for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which [is] not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish."
Esther,4,17,"So Mordekhai [little man] went his way, and did according to all that Ester [star] had commanded him."
Esther,5,1,"Now it came to pass on the third day, that Ester [star] put on [her] royal [apparel] , and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house."
Esther,5,2,"And it was so, when the king saw Ester [star] the queen standing in the court, [that] she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Ester [star] the golden scepter that [was] in his hand. So Ester [star] drew near, and touched the top of the scepter."
Esther,5,3,"Then said the king unto her, What will you i , queen Ester [star] ? and what [is] you i request? it shall be even given you i to the half of the kingdom."
Esther,5,4,"And Ester [star] answered, If [it seem] good unto the king, let the king and Haman [magnificent] come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him."
Esther,5,5,"Then the king said, Cause Haman [magnificent] to make haste, that he may do as Ester [star] has said. So the king and Haman [magnificent] came to the banquet that Ester [star] had prepared."
Esther,5,6,"And the king said unto Ester [star] at the banquet of wine, What [is] you i petition? and it shall be granted you i : and what [is] you i request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed."
Esther,5,7,"Then answered Ester [star] , and said, My petition and my request [is];"
Esther,5,8,"If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman [magnificent] come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said."
Esther,5,9,"Then went Haman [magnificent] forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman [magnificent] saw Mordekhai [little man] in the king’s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordekhai [little man]."
Esther,5,10,"Nevertheless Haman [magnificent] refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh [gold] his wife."
Esther,5,11,"And Haman [magnificent] told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all [the things] wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king."
Esther,5,12,"Haman [magnificent] said moreover, Yes, Ester [star] the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow am I invited unto her also with the king."
Esther,5,13,"Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordekhai [little man] the Jew sitting at the king’s gate."
Esther,5,14,"Then said Zeresh [gold] his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallow (to approve, commend, accept)s be made of fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak you i unto the king that Mordekhai [little man] may be hanged thereon: then go you i in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman [magnificent] ; and he caused the gallow (to approve, commend, accept) s to be made."
Esther,6,1,"On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king."
Esther,6,2,"And it was found written, that Mordekhai [little man] had told of Bigtana [in their winepress] and Teresh [strictness] , two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor]."
Esther,6,3,"And the king said, What honour and dignity has been done to Mordekhai [little man] for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him."
Esther,6,4,"And the king said, Who [is] in the court? Now Haman [magnificent] was come into the outward court of the king’s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordekhai [little man] on the gallow (to approve, commend, accept) s that he had prepared for him."
Esther,6,5,"And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman [magnificent] stands in the court. And the king said, Let him come in."
Esther,6,6,"So Haman [magnificent] came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delights to honour? Now Haman [magnificent] thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?"
Esther,6,7,"And Haman [magnificent] answered the king, For the man whom the king delights to honour,"
Esther,6,8,"Let the royal apparel be brought which the king [uses] to wear, and the horse that the king rides upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:"
Esther,6,9,"And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array (to put on; to clothe) the man [withal] whom the king delights to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honour."
Esther,6,10,"Then the king said to Haman [magnificent] , Make haste, [and] take the apparel and the horse, as you i have said, and do even so to Mordekhai [little man] the Jew, that sits at the king’s gate: let nothing fail of all that you i have spoken."
Esther,6,11,"Then took Haman [magnificent] the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordekhai [little man] , and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delights to honour."
Esther,6,12,"And Mordekhai [little man] came again to the king’s gate. But Haman [magnificent] hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered."
Esther,6,13,"And Haman [magnificent] told Zeresh [gold] his wife and all his friends every [thing] that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh [gold] his wife unto him, If Mordekhai [little man] [be] of the seed of the Y’hudim (Judeans) , before whom you i have begun to fall, you i shall not prevail against him, but shall surely fall before him."
Esther,6,14,"And while they [were] yet talking with him, came the king’s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman [magnificent] unto the banquet that Ester [star] had prepared."
Esther,7,1,So the king and Haman [magnificent] came to banquet with Ester [star] the queen.
Esther,7,2,"And the king said again unto Ester [star] on the second day at the banquet of wine, What [is] you i petition, queen Ester [star] ? and it shall be granted you i : and what [is] you i request? and it shall be performed, [even] to the half of the kingdom."
Esther,7,3,"Then Ester [star] the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in you i sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:"
Esther,7,4,"For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail (be or make equal; compensate) the king’s damage."
Esther,7,5,"Then the king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] answered and said unto Ester [star] the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that dared (was bold enough) presume in his heart to do so?"
Esther,7,6,"And Ester [star] said, The adversary and enemy [is] this wicked Haman [magnificent] . Then Haman [magnificent] was afraid before the king and the queen."
Esther,7,7,And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath [went] into the palace garden: and Haman [magnificent] stood up to make request for his life to Ester [star] the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
Esther,7,8,"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman [magnificent] was fallen upon the bed whereon Ester [star] [was] . Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman [magnificent] ’s face."
Esther,7,9,"And Harvonah [ass-driver] , one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallow (to approve, commend, accept) s fifty cubits high, which Haman [magnificent] had made for Mordekhai [little man] , who had spoken good for the king, stands in the house of Haman [magnificent] . Then the king said, Hang him thereon."
Esther,7,10,"So they hanged Haman [magnificent] on the gallow (to approve, commend, accept) s that he had prepared for Mordekhai [little man] . Then was the king’s wrath pacified."
Esther,8,1,On that day did the king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] give the house of Haman [magnificent] the Y’hudit (Y’hudim (Judeans)’) enemy unto Ester [star] the queen. And Mordekhai [little man] came before the king; for Ester [star] had told what he [was] unto her.
Esther,8,2,"And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman [magnificent] , and gave it unto Mordekhai [little man] . And Ester [star] set Mordekhai [little man] over the house of Haman [magnificent]."
Esther,8,3,"And Ester [star] spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman [magnificent] the Agagi [I will overtop] , and his device that he had devised against the Y’hudim (Judeans)."
Esther,8,4,"Then the king held out the golden scepter toward Ester [star] . So Ester [star] arose, and stood before the king,"
Esther,8,5,"And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing [seem] right before the king, and I [be] pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman [magnificent] the son of Hamdata [double] the Agagi [I will overtop] , which he wrote to destroy the Y’hudim (Judeans) which [are] in all the king’s provinces:"
Esther,8,6,For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my family?
Esther,8,7,"Then the king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] said unto Ester [star] the queen and to Mordekhai [little man] the Jew, Behold, I have given Ester [star] the house of Haman [magnificent] , and him they have hanged upon the gallow (to approve, commend, accept) s, because he laid his hand upon the Y’hudim (Judeans)."
Esther,8,8,"Write you 2f also for the Y’hudim (Judeans) , as it likes you, in the king’s name, and seal [it] with the king’s ring: for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may no man reverse."
Esther,8,9,"Then were the king’s scribes called at that time in the third month, that [is] , the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth [day] thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordekhai [little man] commanded unto the Y’hudim (Judeans) , and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which [are] from India unto Ethiopia [Kush] , an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Y’hudim (Judeans) according to their writing, and according to their language."
Esther,8,10,"And he wrote in the king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] ’ name, and sealed [it] with the king’s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, [and] riders on mules, camels, [and] young dromedaries:"
Esther,8,11,"Wherein the king granted the Y’hudim (Judeans) which [were] in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, [both] little ones and women, and [to take] the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) of them for a prey,"
Esther,8,12,"Upon one day in all the provinces of king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor], [namely] , upon the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which [is] the month Adar."
Esther,8,13,"The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province [was] published unto all people, and that the Y’hudim (Judeans) should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies."
Esther,8,14," [So] the posts that rode upon mules [and] camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan [lily] the palace."
Esther,8,15,"And Mordekhai [little man] went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan [lily] rejoiced and was glad."
Esther,8,16,"The Y’hudim (Judeans) had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour."
Esther,8,17,"And in every province, and in every city, to wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Y’hudim (Judeans) had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Y’hudim (Judeans) ; for the fear of the Y’hudim (Judeans) fell upon them."
Esther,9,1,"Now in the twelfth month, that [is] , the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Y’hudim (Judeans) hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Y’hudim (Judeans) had rule over them that hated them;)"
Esther,9,2,"The Y’hudim (Judeans) gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] , to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people."
Esther,9,3,"And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Y’hudim (Judeans) ; because the fear of Mordekhai [little man] fell upon them."
Esther,9,4,"For Mordekhai [little man] [was] great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordekhai [little man] waxed greater and greater."
Esther,9,5,"Thus the Y’hudim (Judeans) struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them."
Esther,9,6,And in Shushan [lily] the palace the Y’hudim (Judeans) killed and destroyed five hundred men.
Esther,9,7,"And Parshandata [given by prayer] , and Dalfon [dripping] , and Aspata [the enticed gathered],"
Esther,9,8,"And Porata [fruitfulness, or frustration] , and Adalya [I shall be drawn up of Yah] , and Aridata [the lion of the decree],"
Esther,9,9,"And Parmashta [superior] , and Arisai [meaning disputed] , and Aridai [the lion is enough] , and Vaizata [strong as the wind],"
Esther,9,10,"The ten sons of Haman [magnificent] the son of Hamdata [double] , the enemy of the Y’hudim (Judeans) , killed they; but on the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) laid they not their hand."
Esther,9,11,On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan [lily] the palace was brought before the king.
Esther,9,12,"And the king said unto Ester [star] the queen, The Y’hudim (Judeans) have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan [lily] the palace, and the ten sons of Haman [magnificent] ; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now what [is] you i petition? and it shall be granted you i : or what [is] you i request further? and it shall be done."
Esther,9,13,"Then said Ester [star] , If it please the king, let it be granted to the Y’hudim (Judeans) which [are] in Shushan [lily] to do tomorrow also according unto this day’s decree, and let Haman [magnificent] ’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallow (to approve, commend, accept)s."
Esther,9,14,And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan [lily] ; and they hanged Haman [magnificent] ’s ten sons.
Esther,9,15,"For the Y’hudim (Judeans) that [were] in Shushan [lily] gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and killed three hundred men at Shushan [lily] ; but on the prey they laid not their hand."
Esther,9,16,"But the other Y’hudim (Judeans) that [were] in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and killed of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,"
Esther,9,17,"On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness."
Esther,9,18,"But the Y’hudim (Judeans) that [were] at Shushan [lily] assembled together on the thirteenth [day] thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth [day] of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness."
Esther,9,19,"Therefore the Y’hudim (Judeans) of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar [a day of] gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another."
Esther,9,20,"And Mordekhai [little man] wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Y’hudim (Judeans) that [were] in all the provinces of the king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor], [both] near and far,"
Esther,9,21,"To establish [this] among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,"
Esther,9,22,"As the days wherein the Y’hudim (Judeans) rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor."
Esther,9,23,"And the Y’hudim (Judeans) undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordekhai [little man] had written unto them;"
Esther,9,24,"Because Haman [magnificent] the son of Hamdata [double] , the Agagi [I will overtop] , the enemy of all the Y’hudim (Judeans) , had devised against the Y’hudim (Judeans) to destroy them, and had cast Pur [lot] , that [is] , the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;"
Esther,9,25,"But when [Ester [star] ] came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Y’hudim (Judeans) , should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallow (to approve, commend, accept) s."
Esther,9,26,"For what reason they called these days Purim after the name of Pur [lot] . Therefore for all the words of this letter, and [of that] which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,"
Esther,9,27,"The Y’hudim (Judeans) ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their [appointed] time every year;"
Esther,9,28,"And [that] these days [should be] remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and [that] these days of Purim should not fail from among the Y’hudim (Judeans) , nor the memorial of them perish from their seed."
Esther,9,29,"Then Ester [star] the queen, the daughter of Avichayil [Father of Strength] , and Mordekhai [little man] the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim."
Esther,9,30,"And he sent the letters unto all the Y’hudim (Judeans) , to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor], [with] words of peace and truth,"
Esther,9,31,"To confirm these days of Purim in their times [appointed] , according as Mordekhai [little man] the Jew and Ester [star] the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry."
Esther,9,32,And the decree of Ester [star] confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
Esther,10,1,"And the king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] laid a tribute upon the land, and [upon] the isles of the sea."
Esther,10,2,"And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordekhai [little man] , whereunto the king advanced him, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Madai [middle land] and Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid]?"
Esther,10,3,"For Mordekhai [little man] the Jew [was] next unto king Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] , and great among the Y’hudim (Judeans) , and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed."
