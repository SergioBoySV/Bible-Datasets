Exodus,1,1,"Now these [are] the names of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which came into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ; every man and his household came with Ya’akov [Heal of God]."
Exodus,1,2,"Re’uven [Behold a Son] [Behold a Son] , Shim’on [he who hears] , Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] , and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised],"
Exodus,1,3,"Yissakhar [There Is Recompense] , Z’vulun [Glorious Dwelling Place] , and Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength],"
Exodus,1,4,"Dan [Judge] , and Naftali [My Wrestling] , Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] , and Asher [Happy]."
Exodus,1,5,And all the souls that came out of the waist of Ya’akov [Heal of God] were seventy souls: for Yosef [(God) He Shall Add] was in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] [already].
Exodus,1,6,"And Yosef [(God) He Shall Add] died, and all his brethren, and all that generation."
Exodus,1,7,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them."
Exodus,1,8,"Now there arose up a new king over Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , which knew not Yosef [(God) He Shall Add]."
Exodus,1,9,"And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [are] more and mightier than we:"
Exodus,1,10,"Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falls out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and [so] get them up out of the land."
Exodus,1,11,"Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] treasure cities, Pitom [City of Justice] and Ra’amses [Child of the Sun]."
Exodus,1,12,"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Exodus,1,13,And the Mitzri made the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to serve with rigour:
Exodus,1,14,"And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, [was] with rigour."
Exodus,1,15,"And the king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] spoke to the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] midwives, of which the name of the one [was] Shif’rah [Beautiful] , and the name of the other Puah [Splendid]:"
Exodus,1,16,"And he said, When you 2f do the office of a midwife to the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] women, and see [them] upon the stools; if it [be] a son, then you 2f shall kill him: but if it [be] a daughter, then she shall live."
Exodus,1,17,"But the midwives feared God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and did not as the king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] commanded them, but saved the men children alive."
Exodus,1,18,"And the king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have you 2f done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?"
Exodus,1,19,"And the midwives said unto Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] , Because the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] women [are] not as the Mitzri [Egyptian] women; for they [are] lively, and are delivered before the midwives come in unto them."
Exodus,1,20,"Therefore God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty."
Exodus,1,21,"And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , that he made them houses."
Exodus,1,22,"And Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] charged all his people, saying, Khav’vah [Eve] (to breath, to live) every son that is born you 2f shall cast into the river, and every daughter you 2f shall save alive."
Exodus,2,1,"And there went a man of the house of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] , and took [to wife] a daughter of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner]."
Exodus,2,2,"And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he [was a] goodly [child] , she hid him three months."
Exodus,2,3,"And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child in it; and she laid [it] in the flags by the river’s brink."
Exodus,2,4,"And his sister stood afar off, that is to say what would be done to him."
Exodus,2,5,"And the daughter of Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] came down to wash [herself] at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it."
Exodus,2,6,"And when she had opened [it] , she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This [is one] of the ‘Evrim [Hebrew] children."
Exodus,2,7,"Then said his sister to Par’oh’s [Pharaoh - Great House] daughter, Shall I go and call to (to do entirely, do wholly) you i a nurse of the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] women, that she may nurse the child for you i?"
Exodus,2,8,"And Par’oh’s [Pharaoh - Great House] daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child’s mother."
Exodus,2,9,"And Par’oh’s [Pharaoh - Great House] daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give [you i ] your i wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it."
Exodus,2,10,"And the child grew, and she brought him unto Par’oh’s [Pharaoh - Great House] daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] : and she said, Because I drew him out of the water."
Exodus,2,11,"And it came to pass in those days, when Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Mitzri [Egyptian] attacking an ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] , one of his brethren."
Exodus,2,12,"And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that [there was] no man, he killed the Mitzri [Egyptian] , and hid him in the sand."
Exodus,2,13,"And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, For what reason strike you i your i fellow?"
Exodus,2,14,"And he said, Who made you i a prince and a judge over us? intend you i to kill me, as you i killed the Mitzri [Egyptian] ? And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] feared, and said, Surely this thing is known."
Exodus,2,15,"Now when Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] heard this thing, he sought to slay Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] . But Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] fled from the face of Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] , and dwelt in the land of Midyan [Strife] : and he sat down by a well."
Exodus,2,16,"Now the priest of Midyan [Strife] had seven daughters: and they came and drew [water] , and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock."
Exodus,2,17,"And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] stood up and helped them, and watered their flock."
Exodus,2,18,"And when they came to Reu’el [Friend of God] their father, he said, How [is it that] you 2f are come so soon to day?"
Exodus,2,19,"And they said, An Mitzri [Egyptian] delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew [water] enough for us, and watered the flock."
Exodus,2,20,"And he said unto his daughters, And where [is] he? why [is] it [that] you 2f have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread."
Exodus,2,21,And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moshe his daughter.
Exodus,2,22,"And she bore [him] a son, and he called his name Gershom [Exiled One] : for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land."
Exodus,2,23,"And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] died: and the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] by reason of the bondage."
Exodus,2,24,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] heard their groaning, and God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] remembered his covenant with Avraham [Exalted Father] , with Yitz’chak [Laughter] , and with Ya’akov [Heal of God]."
Exodus,2,25,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] looked upon the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and God-Elōhīm [The Creator] had respect unto [them]."
Exodus,3,1,"Now Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] kept the flock of Yitro [Excellence] his father in law, the priest of Midyan [Strife] : and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered], [even] to Horev [Desert]."
Exodus,3,2,"And the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush [was] not consumed."
Exodus,3,3,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt."
Exodus,3,4,"And when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) saw that he turned aside to see, God-Elōhīm [The Living Word] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moshe, Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] . And he said, Here [am] I."
Exodus,3,5,"And he said, Draw not near here: put off you i shoes from off you i feet, for the place whereon you i stand [is] holy ground."
Exodus,3,6,"Moreover he said, I [am] the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of your i father, the God-Elōhīm [The Powerful Living Word] of Avraham [Exalted Father] , the God-Elōhīm [The Powerful One] of Yitz’chak [Laughter] , and the God-Elōhīm [The Powerful Creator] of Ya’akov [Heal of God] . And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God-Elōhīm [The Living Word]."
Exodus,3,7,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which [are] in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;"
Exodus,3,8,"And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Mitzri, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Kena’ani [Merchant] , and the Hitti [Terrorists] , and the Emori [Highlanders] , and the P’rizi [Dwellers in Unwalled Towns] , and the Hivi [Villagers] , and the Y’vusi [Threshers, Trampled Under Foot]."
Exodus,3,9,"Now therefore, behold, the cry of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression which the Mitzri oppress them."
Exodus,3,10,"Come now therefore, and I will send you i unto Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] , that you i may bring forth my people the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
Exodus,3,11,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , Who [am] I, that I should go unto Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] , and that I should bring forth the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]?"
Exodus,3,12,"And he said, Certainly, I will be with you i ; and this [shall be] a token unto you i , that I have sent you i : When you i have brought forth the people out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , you 2f shall serve God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] upon this mountain."
Exodus,3,13,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , Behold, [when] I come unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and shall say unto them, The God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of your fathers has sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What [is] his name? what shall I say unto them?"
Exodus,3,14,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] : Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh [I am/will be what I am/will be] and he said, “Thus shall you i say unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : ‘Ehyeh [I Am or I Will Be] …has sent me unto you.”"
Exodus,3,15,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] said moreover unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , Thus shall you i say unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]: [The Lord-Yehōvah] of your fathers, the God-Elōhīm [Creator] of Avraham [Exalted Father] , the God-Elōhīm [Creator] of Yitz’chak [Laughter] , and the God-Elōhīm [Creator] of Ya’akov [Heal of God] , has sent me unto you: this [is] my name forever, and this [is] my memorial unto all generations."
Exodus,3,16,"Go, and gather the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] together, and say unto them, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of your fathers, the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Avraham [Exalted Father] , of Yitz’chak [Laughter] , and of Ya’akov [Heal of God] , appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and [seen] that which is done to you in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]:"
Exodus,3,17,"And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] unto the land of the Kena’ani [Merchant] , and the Hitti [Terrorists] , and the Emori [Highlanders] , and the P’rizi [Dwellers in Unwalled Towns] , and the Hivi [Villagers] , and the Y’vusi [Threshers, Trampled Under Foot] , unto a land flowing with milk and honey."
Exodus,3,18,"And they shall hearken to you i voice: and you i shall come, you i and the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , unto the king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and you 2f shall say unto him, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm [The Living Word] of the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrews] has met with us: and now let us go, we beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm [The Living Word]."
Exodus,3,19,"And I am sure that the king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand."
Exodus,3,20,"And I will stretch out my hand, and strike Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that, he will let you go."
Exodus,3,21,"And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Mitzri: and it shall come to pass, that, when you 2f go, you 2f shall not go empty:"
Exodus,3,22,"But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourns in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing: and you 2f shall put [them] upon your sons, and upon your 2f daughters; and you 2f shall spoil (plunder; prey; booty) the Mitzri."
Exodus,4,1,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has not appeared unto you i."
Exodus,4,2,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto him, What [is] that in you i hand? And he said, A rod."
Exodus,4,3,"And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] fled from before it."
Exodus,4,4,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , Put forth you i hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:"
Exodus,4,5,"That they may believe that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of their fathers, the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Avraham [Exalted Father] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yitz’chak [Laughter] , and the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Ya’akov [Heal of God] , has appeared unto you i."
Exodus,4,6,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said furthermore unto him, Put now you i hand into you i bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand [was] leprous as snow."
Exodus,4,7,"And he said, Put you i hand into you i bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his [other] flesh."

Exodus,4,10,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , O my Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Lord Above All Things] , I [am] not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you i have spoken unto you i servant: but I [am] slow of speech, and of a slow tongue."
Exodus,4,11,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto him, Who has made man’s mouth? or who makes the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)?"
Exodus,4,12,"Now therefore go, and I will be with you i mouth, and teach you i what you i shall say."
Exodus,4,13,"And he said, O my Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Lord Above All Things] , send, I pray you i , by the hand [of him whom] you i will send."
Exodus,4,14,"And the anger of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was kindled against Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , and he said, [Is] not Aharon [Bright, Very High] the Levi (Levite) [Joined to] you i brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he comes forth to meet you i : and when he sees you i , he will be glad in his heart."
Exodus,4,15,"And you i shall speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with you i mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you 2f shall do."

And Yitro [Excellence] said to Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , Go in peace."
Exodus,4,19,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] in Midyan [Strife] , Go, return into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : for all the men are dead which sought you i life."
Exodus,4,20,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : and Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] took the rod of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in his hand."
Exodus,4,21,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , When you i goes to return into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , see that you i do all those wonders before Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] , which I have put in you i hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go."
Exodus,4,22,"And you i shall say unto Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] , Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [is] my son, [even] my firstborn:"

Exodus,4,29,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and Aharon [Bright, Very High] went and gathered together all the elders of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]:"
Exodus,4,30,"And Aharon [Bright, Very High] spoke all the words which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had spoken unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , and did the signs in the sight of the people."
Exodus,4,31,"And the people believed: and when they heard that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had visited the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped."
Exodus,5,1,"And afterward Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and Aharon [Bright, Very High] went in, and told Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] , Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness."
Exodus,5,2,"And Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] said, Who [is] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that I should obey his voice to let Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] go? I know not the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , neither will I let Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] go."
Exodus,5,3,"And they said, The God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] has met with us: let us go, we pray you i , three days’ journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword."
Exodus,5,4,"And the king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] said unto them, For what reason do you 2f , Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and Aharon [Bright, Very High] , let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens."
Exodus,5,5,"And Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] said, Behold, the people of the land now [are] many, and you 2f make them rest from their burdens."
Exodus,5,6,"And Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,"
Exodus,5,7,"You 2f shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves."
Exodus,5,8,"And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, you 2f shall lay upon them; you 2f shall not diminish [ought] thereof: for they [be] idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go [and] sacrifice to our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Exodus,5,9,"Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour in it; and let them not regard vain words."
Exodus,5,10,"And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] , I will not give you straw."
Exodus,5,11,"Go you 2f , get you straw where you 2f can find it: yet none of your work shall be diminished."
Exodus,5,12,So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] to gather stubble instead of straw.
Exodus,5,13,"And the taskmasters hasted [them] , saying, Fulfill your works, [your] daily tasks, as when there was straw."
Exodus,5,14,"And the officers of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which Par’oh’s [Pharaoh - Great House] taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, [and] demanded, For what reason have you 2f not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today, as heretofore?"
Exodus,5,15,"Then the officers of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came and cried unto Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] , saying, For what reason do you i deal thus with your i servants?"
Exodus,5,16,"There is no straw given unto you i servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, you i servants [are] beaten; but the fault [is] in you i own people."
Exodus,5,17,"But he said, You 2f [are] idle, [you 2f are] idle: therefore you 2f say, Let us go [and] do sacrifice to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Exodus,5,18,"Go therefore now, [and] work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall you 2f deliver the tale of bricks."
Exodus,5,19,"And the officers of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did see [that] they [were] in evil [case] , after it was said, You 2f shall not diminish [ought] from your bricks of your daily task."
Exodus,5,20,"And they met Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and Aharon [Bright, Very High] , who stood in the way, as they came forth from Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House]:"
Exodus,5,21,"And they said unto them, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) look upon you, and judge; because you 2f have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] , and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us."
Exodus,5,22,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] returned unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Lord Above All Things] , wherefore have you i [so] evil entreated this people? why [is] it [that] you i have sent me?"

Exodus,14,5,"And it was told the king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] that the people fled: and the heart of Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] go from serving us?"

Exodus,14,12," [Is] not this the word that we did tell you i in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Mitzri? For [it had been] better for us to serve the Mitzri, than that we should die in the wilderness."
Exodus,14,13,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto the people, Fear you 2f not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he will show to you today: for the Mitzri whom you 2f have seen today, you 2f shall see them again no more forever."

Exodus,14,16,"But lift you i up you i rod, and stretch out you i hand over the sea, and divide it: and the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall go on dry [ground] through the midst of the sea."

Exodus,14,18,"And the Mitzri shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , when I have gotten me honour upon Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] , upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen."
Exodus,14,19,"And the angel of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which went before the camp of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:"
Exodus,14,20,"And it came between the camp of the Mitzri and the camp of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and it was a cloud and darkness [to them] , but it gave light by night [to these] : so that the one came not near the other all the night."
Exodus,14,21,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) caused the sea to go [back] by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry [land] , and the waters were divided."

Exodus,14,25,"And took off their chariot wheels, that they drove them heavily: so that the Mitzri said, Let us flee from the face of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) fights for them against the Mitzri."
Exodus,14,26,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , Stretch out you i hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Mitzri, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen."

Exodus,14,30,Thus the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) saved Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that day out of the hand of the Mitzri; and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] saw the Mitzri dead upon the sea shore.
Exodus,14,31,"And Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] saw that great work which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) did upon the Mitzri: and the people feared the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and believed the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and his servant Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Exodus,15,1,"Then sang Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] this song unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and spoke, saying, I will sing unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , for he has triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea."

Exodus,15,26,"And said, If you i will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and will do that which is right in his sight, and will give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon you i , which I have brought upon the Mitzri: for I [am] Yehovah Rof’ekha [Messiah Pre-Incarnate that heals you]."

Exodus,16,8,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said, [This shall be] , when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) hears your murmurings which you 2f murmur against him: and what [are] we? your murmurings [are] not against us, but against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Exodus,16,9,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] spoke unto Aharon [Bright, Very High] , Say unto all the congregation of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Come near before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : for he has heard your murmurings."
Exodus,16,10,"And it came to pass, as Aharon [Bright, Very High] spoke unto the whole congregation of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) appeared in the cloud."

Exodus,16,13,"And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host."
Exodus,16,14,"And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness [there lay] a small round thing, [as] small as the grey frost on the ground."
Exodus,16,15,"And when the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] saw [it] , they said one to another, It [is] manna: for they did not know what it [was] . And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto them, This [is] the bread which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has given you to eat."
Exodus,16,16,"This [is] the thing which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, [according to] the number of your persons; take you 2f every man for [them] which [are] in his tents."
Exodus,16,17,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did so, and gathered, some more, some less."
Exodus,16,18,"And when they did measure (deal out) [it] with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating."
Exodus,16,19,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said, Let no man leave of it till the morning."
Exodus,16,20,"Yet they listened not unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] ; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] was exceedingly angry with them."
Exodus,16,21,"And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted."
Exodus,16,22,"And it came to pass, [that] on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one [man] : and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Exodus,16,23,"And he said unto them, This [is that] which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has said, Tomorrow [is] the rest of the Holy Shabbat [Rest] unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : bake [that] which you 2f will bake [today] , and seethe that you 2f will seethe; and that which remains over lay up for you to be kept until the morning."
Exodus,16,24,"And they laid it up till the morning, as Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm in it."
Exodus,16,25,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said, Eat that today; for today [is] a Shabbat [Rest] unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : today you 2f shall not find it in the field."
Exodus,16,26,"Six days you 2f shall gather it; but on the seventh day, [which is] the Shabbat [Rest] , in it there shall be none."
Exodus,16,27,"And it came to pass, [that] there went out [some] of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none."
Exodus,16,28,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , How long refuse you 2f to keep my commandments and my laws?"
Exodus,16,29,"See, for that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has given you the Shabbat [Rest] , therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide you 2f every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day."
Exodus,16,30,So the people rested on the seventh day.
Exodus,16,31,"And the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] called the name thereof Manna: and it [was] like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it [was] like wafers [made] with honey."
Exodus,16,32,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said, This [is] the thing which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commands, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread which I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
Exodus,16,33,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto Aharon [Bright, Very High] , Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna in it, and lay it up before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to be kept for your generations."
Exodus,16,34,"As the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , so Aharon [Bright, Very High] laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept."
Exodus,16,35,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Kena’an [Merchant]."
Exodus,16,36,Now an omer [is] the tenth [part] of an eifah.
Exodus,17,1,"And all the congregation of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and pitched in Refidim [Resting Places] : and [there was] no water for the people to drink."
Exodus,17,2,"For what reason the people did quarrel with Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto them, Why quarrel you 2f with me? wherefore do you 2f tempt the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)?"
Exodus,17,3,"And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , and said, For what reason [is] this [that] you i have brought us up out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?"
Exodus,17,4,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me."
Exodus,17,5,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , Go on before the people, and take with you i of the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and your i rod, which you i stuck the river, take in your i hand, and go."
Exodus,17,6,"Behold, I will stand before you i there upon the rock in Horev [Desert] ; and you i shall strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] did so in the sight of the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Exodus,17,7,"And he called the name of the place Massah [Testing] , and M’rivah [Arguing] , because of the chiding of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and because they tempted the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, Is the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) among us, or not?"
Exodus,17,8,"Then came ‘Amalek [Dweller in a Valley] , and fought with Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in Refidim [Resting Places]."
Exodus,17,9,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , Choose us out men, and go out, fight with ‘Amalek [Dweller in a Valley] : tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in my hand."
Exodus,17,10,"So Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] did as Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] had said to him, and fought with ‘Amalek [Dweller in a Valley] : and Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , Aharon [Bright, Very High] , and Hur [Liberty] went up to the top of the hill."
Exodus,17,11,"And it came to pass, when Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] held up his hand, that Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] prevailed: and when he let down his hand, ‘Amalek [Dweller in a Valley] prevailed."
Exodus,17,12,"But Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] ’ hands [were] heavy; and they took a stone, and put [it] under him, and he sat thereon; and Aharon [Bright, Very High] and Hur [Liberty] detained (held) up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun."
Exodus,17,13,And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] scattered (defeated in battle) ‘Amalek [Dweller in a Valley] and his people with the edge of the sword.
Exodus,17,14,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , Write this [for] a memorial in a book, and rehearse [it] in the ears of Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] : for I will utterly put out the remembrance of ‘Amalek [Dweller in a Valley] from under heaven."
Exodus,17,15,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] built an altar, and called the name of it Yehovah-Nissi [God is My Banner/Miracle]:"
Exodus,17,16,"For he said, Because the Lord-Yah [Behold The Hand] (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has sworn [that] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [will have] war with ‘Amalek [Dweller in a Valley] from generation to generation."
Exodus,18,1,"When Yitro [Excellence] , the priest of Midyan [Strife] , Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] ’ father in law, heard of all that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had done for Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , and for Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] his people, [and] that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had brought Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place];"
