Numbers,11,20," [But] even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that you 2f have despised the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) which [is] among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]?"
Numbers,11,21,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said, The people, among whom I [am], [are] six hundred thousand footmen; and you i have said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month."
Numbers,11,22,"Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?"
Numbers,11,23,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , Is the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] hand waxed short? you i shall see now whether my word shall come to pass unto you i or not."
Numbers,11,24,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] went out, and told the people the words of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle."
Numbers,11,25,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came down in a cloud, and spoke unto him, and took of the spirit that [was] upon him, and gave [it] unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, [that] , when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease."
Numbers,11,26,"But there remained two [of the] men in the camp, the name of the one [was] Eldad [God has Loved] , and the name of the other Medad [Love] : and the spirit rested upon them; and they [were] of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp."
Numbers,11,27,"And there ran a young man, and told Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , and said, Eldad [God has Loved] and Medad [Love] do prophesy in the camp."
Numbers,11,28,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Nun [Posterity] , the servant of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters], [one] of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , forbid them."
Numbers,11,29,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto him, Envy you i for my sake? would God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] that all the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] people were prophets, [and] that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) would put his spirit upon them!"
Numbers,11,30,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] got him into the camp, he and the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Numbers,11,31,"And there went forth a wind from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and brought quails from the sea, and let [them] fall by the camp, as it were a day’s journey on this side, and as it were a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits [high] upon the face of the earth."
Numbers,11,32,"And the people stood up all that day, and all [that] night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread [them] all abroad for themselves round about the camp."
Numbers,11,33,"And while the flesh [was] yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was kindled against the people, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) struck the people with a very great plague."
Numbers,11,34,And he called the name of that place Kivrot-HaTa’avah [Graves of Lust] : because there they buried the people that lusted.
Numbers,11,35, [And] the people journeyed from Kivrot-HaTa’avah [Graves of Lust] unto Hatzerot [A Place in the Wilderness] ; and abode at Hatzerot [A Place in the Wilderness].
Numbers,12,1,"And Miryam [rebellion] and Aharon [Bright, Very High] spoke against Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] because of the Cushi (Ethiopian) woman whom he had married: for he had married an Cushi (Ethiopian) woman."
Numbers,12,2,"And they said, Has the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) indeed spoken only by Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] ? has he not spoken also by us? And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) heard [it]."
Numbers,12,3," (Now the man Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] [was] very meek, above all the men which [were] upon the face of the earth.)"
Numbers,12,4,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke suddenly unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , and unto Aharon [Bright, Very High] , and unto Miryam [rebellion] , Come out you 2f three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out."
Numbers,12,5,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood [in] the door of the tabernacle, and called Aharon [Bright, Very High] and Miryam [rebellion] : and they both came forth."
Numbers,12,6,"And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, [I] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will make myself known unto him in a vision, [and] will speak unto him in a dream."
Numbers,12,7,"My servant Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] [is] not so, who [is] faithful in all my house."
Numbers,12,8,"With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall he behold: wherefore then were you 2f not afraid to speak against my servant Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]?"
Numbers,12,9,And the anger of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was kindled against them; and he departed.
Numbers,12,10,"And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miryam [rebellion] [became] leprous, [white] as snow: and Aharon [Bright, Very High] looked upon Miryam [rebellion] , and, behold, [she was] leprous."
Numbers,12,11,"And Aharon [Bright, Very High] said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , Alas, my lord, I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned."
Numbers,12,12,"Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb."
Numbers,12,13,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, Heal her now, O God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i."
Numbers,12,14,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in [again]."
Numbers,12,15,And Miryam [rebellion] was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miryam [rebellion] was brought in [again].
Numbers,12,16,"And afterward the people removed from Hatzerot [A Place in the Wilderness] , and pitched in the wilderness of Pa’ran [place of caverns]."
Numbers,13,1,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying,"
Numbers,13,2,"Send you i men, that they may search the land of Kena’an [Merchant] , which I give unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : of every tribe of their fathers shall you 2f send a man, everyone a ruler among them."
Numbers,13,3,And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] by the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent them from the wilderness of Pa’ran [place of caverns] : all those men [were] heads of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
Numbers,13,4,"And these [were] their names: of the tribe of Re’uven [Behold a Son] , Shamua [Renowned] the son of Zakur [Mindful]."
Numbers,13,5,"Of the tribe of Shim’on [he who hears] , Shafat [He Has Judged] the son of Hori [Cave Dweller]."

Numbers,13,16,These [are] the names of the men which Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] sent to spy out the land. And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] called Hoshea [salvation] the son of Nun [Posterity] Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] [Jehovah is Salvation].
Numbers,13,17,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] sent them to spy out the land of Kena’an [Merchant] , and said unto them, Get you up this [way] southward, and go up into the mountain:"
Numbers,13,18,"And see the land, what it [is] ; and the people that dwell in it, whether they [be] strong or weak, few or many;"
Numbers,13,19,"And what the land [is] that they dwell in, whether it [be] good or bad; and what cities [they be] that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;"
Numbers,13,20,"And what the land [is] , whether it [be] fat or lean, whether there be wood in it, or not. And be you 2f of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time [was] the time of the firstripe grapes."
Numbers,13,21,"So they went up, and searched the land from the Wilderness of Tzin [Flat] unto Rechov [Broad Place] , as men come to Hamat [Fortress]."
Numbers,13,22,"And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hevron [Seat of Association] ; where Achiman [My Brother is a Gift] , Sheshai [Noble] , and Talmai [Plowman] , the children of Anak [Neck], [were]. (Now Hevron [Seat of Association] was built seven years before Tzo’an [Place of Departure] in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place].)"
Numbers,13,23,"And they came unto the brook of Eshkol [Cluster] , and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it between two upon a staff; and [they brought] of the pomegranates, and of the figs."
Numbers,13,24,"The place was called the brook Eshkol [Cluster] , because of the cluster of grapes which the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] cut down from there."
Numbers,13,25,And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
Numbers,13,26,"And they went and came to Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , and to Aharon [Bright, Very High] , and to all the congregation of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , unto the wilderness of Pa’ran [place of caverns] , to Kadesh [Holy] ; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land."
Numbers,13,27,"And they told him, and said, We came unto the land to which you i sent us, and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this [is] the fruit of it."
Numbers,13,28,"Nevertheless the people [be] strong that dwell in the land, and the cities [are] walled, [and] very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak [Neck] there."
Numbers,13,29,"The ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley] dwell in the land of the south: and the Hitti [Terrorists] , and the Y’vusi [Threshers, Trampled Under Foot] , and the Emori [Highlanders] , dwell in the mountains: and the Kena’ani [Merchant] dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Yarden [Descender]."
Numbers,13,30,"And Kalev [Dog] stilled the people before Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it."
Numbers,13,31,"But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they [are] stronger than we."
Numbers,13,32,"And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, [is] a land that eats up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it [are] men of a great stature."
Numbers,13,33,"And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak [Neck], [which come] of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight."
Numbers,14,1,"And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night."
Numbers,14,2,"And all the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] murmured against Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and against Aharon [Bright, Very High] : and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] that we had died in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ! or would God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] we had died in this wilderness!"
Numbers,14,3,"And wherefore has the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]?"
Numbers,14,4,"And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
Numbers,14,5,"Then Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and Aharon [Bright, Very High] fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Numbers,14,6,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Nun [Posterity] , and Kalev [Dog] the son of Y’funeh [He Will Face], [which were] of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:"
Numbers,14,7,"And they spoke unto all the company of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, [is] an exceeding good land."
Numbers,14,8,"If the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which flows with milk and honey."
Numbers,14,9,"Only rebel not you 2f against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , neither fear you 2f the people of the land; for they [are] bread for us: their defense is departed from them, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] with us: fear them not."
Numbers,14,10,But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
Numbers,14,11,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be before they believe me, for all the signs which I have showed among them?"
Numbers,14,12,"I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you i a greater nation and mightier than they."
Numbers,14,13,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Then the Mitzri shall hear [it], (for you i brought up this people in you i might from among them;)"
Numbers,14,14,"And they will tell [it] to the inhabitants of this land: [for] they have heard that you i Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [are] among this people, that you i Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) are seen face to face, and [that] your i cloud stands over them, and [that] you i go before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night."
Numbers,14,15,"Now [if] you i shall kill [all] this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you i will speak, saying,"
Numbers,14,16,"Because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore unto them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness."
Numbers,14,17,"And now, I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , let the power of my Lord be great, according as you i have spoken, saying,"
Numbers,14,18,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing [the guilty] , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth [generation]."
Numbers,14,19,"Pardon, I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of you i mercy, and as you i have forgiven this people, from Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] even until now."
Numbers,14,20,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, I have pardoned according to you i word:"
Numbers,14,21,"But [as] truly [as] I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Numbers,14,22,"Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not listened to my voice;"
Numbers,14,23,"Surely they shall not see the land which I swore unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:"
Numbers,14,24,"But my servant Kalev [Dog] , because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it."
Numbers,14,25," (Now the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley] and the Kena’ani [Merchant] dwelt in the valley.) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea."
Numbers,14,26,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and unto Aharon [Bright, Very High] , saying,"
Numbers,14,27,"How long [shall I bear with] this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which they murmur against me."
Numbers,14,28,"Say unto them, [As truly as] I live, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , as you 2f have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you:"
Numbers,14,29,"Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,"
Numbers,14,30,"Doubtless you 2f shall not come into the land, [concerning] which I swore to make you dwell in it, save Kalev [Dog] the son of Y’funeh [He Will Face] , and Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Nun [Posterity]."
Numbers,14,31,"But your little ones, which you 2f said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which you 2f have despised."
Numbers,14,32,"But [as for] you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness."
Numbers,14,33,"And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your cult prostitution, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness."
Numbers,14,34,"After the number of the days in which you 2f searched the land, [even] forty days, each day for a year, shall you 2f bear your iniquities, [even] forty years, and you 2f shall know my breach (breaking forth; a break; opening, inlet) of promise."
Numbers,14,35,"I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die."
Numbers,14,36,"And the men, which Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,"
Numbers,14,37,"Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Numbers,14,38,"But Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Nun [Posterity] , and Kalev [Dog] the son of Y’funeh [He Will Face], [which were] of the men that went to search the land, lived [still]."
Numbers,14,39,And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] told these sayings unto all the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and the people mourned greatly.
Numbers,14,40,"And they rose up early in the morning, and got them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we [be here] , and will go up unto the place which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has promised: for we have sinned."
Numbers,14,41,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said, For what reason now do you 2f transgress the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ? but it shall not prosper."
Numbers,14,42,"Go not up, for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] not among you; that you 2f be not smitten before your enemies."
Numbers,14,43,"For the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley] and the Kena’ani [Merchant] [are] there before you, and you 2f shall fall by the sword: because you 2f are turned away from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , therefore the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will not be with you."
Numbers,14,44,"But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , departed not out of the camp."
Numbers,14,45,"Then the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley] came down, and the Kena’anim [Merchants] which dwelt in that hill, and struck them, and scattered (defeated in battle) them, [even] unto Hormah [Asylum]."
Numbers,15,1,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying,"
Numbers,15,2,"Speak unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and say unto them, When you 2f be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,"
Numbers,15,3,"And will make an offering by fire unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a soothing aroma unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , of the herd, or of the flock:"
Numbers,15,4,Then shall he that offers his offering unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth [part] of an hin [a quart] of oil.
Numbers,15,5,"And the fourth [part] of an hin [a quart] of wine for a drink offering shall you i prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb."
Numbers,15,6,"Or for a ram, you i shall prepare [for] a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third [part] of an hin [a quart] of oil."
Numbers,15,7,"And for a drink offering you i shall offer the third [part] of an hin [a quart] of wine, [for] a soothing aroma unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Numbers,15,8,"And when you i prepare a bullock [for] a burnt offering, or [for] a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):"
Numbers,15,9,Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin [a quart] of oil.
Numbers,15,10,"And you i shall bring for a drink offering half an hin [a quart] of wine, [for] an offering made by fire, of a soothing aroma unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Numbers,15,11,"Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid."
Numbers,15,12,"According to the number that you 2f shall prepare, so shall you 2f do to every one according to their number."
Numbers,15,13,"All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a soothing aroma unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Numbers,15,14,"And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever [be] among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a soothing aroma unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; as you 2f do, so he shall do."
Numbers,15,15,"One ordinance [shall be both] for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojournes [with you] , an ordinance forever in your generations: as you 2f [are] , so shall the stranger be before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Numbers,15,16,"One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojournes with you."
Numbers,15,17,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying,"
Numbers,15,18,"Speak unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and say unto them, When you 2f come into the land to which I bring you,"
Numbers,15,19,"Then it shall be, that, when you 2f eat of the bread of the land, you 2f shall offer up an heave offering unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Numbers,15,20,"You 2f shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough [for] an heave offering: as [you 2f do] the heave offering of the threshing floor, so shall you 2f heave it."
Numbers,15,21,Of the first of your dough you 2f shall give unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) an heave offering in your generations.
Numbers,15,22,"And if you 2f have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has spoken unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters],"
Numbers,15,23," [Even] all that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has commanded you by the hand of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , from the day that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded [Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]] , and henceforward among your generations;"
Numbers,15,24,"Then it shall be, if [ought] be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a soothing aroma unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering."
Numbers,15,25,"And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and it shall be forgiven them; for it [is] ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and their sin offering before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , for their ignorance:"
Numbers,15,26,"And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and the stranger that sojournes among them; seeing all the people [were] in ignorance."
Numbers,15,27,"And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering."

Numbers,15,40,"That you 2f may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Numbers,15,41,"I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which brought you out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , to be your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Numbers,16,1,"Now Korakh [Bald] , the son of Yitz’har [Shining Oil] , the son of K’hat [assembly, congregation] , the son of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] , and Datan [belonging to a fountain] and Aviram [My Father is Exalted] , the sons of ‘Eli’av [My Father is God] , and On, the son of Pelet [Swiftness] , sons of Re’uven [Behold a Son] , took [men]:"
Numbers,16,2,"And they rose up before Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , with certain of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown (great reputation; being well-known):"
Numbers,16,3,"And they gathered themselves together against Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and against Aharon [Bright, Very High] , and said unto them, [You 2f take] too much upon you, seeing all the congregation [are] holy, every one of them, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] among them: wherefore then lift you 2f up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)?"
Numbers,16,4,"And when Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] heard [it] , he fell upon his face:"
Numbers,16,5,"And he spoke unto Korakh [Bald] and unto all his company, saying, Even tomorrow the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will show who [are] his, and [who is] holy; and will cause [him] to come near unto him: even [him] whom he has chosen will he cause to come near unto him."
Numbers,16,6,"This do; Take you censers, Korakh [Bald] , and all his company;"
Numbers,16,7,"And put fire in it, and put incense in them before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) tomorrow: and it shall be [that] the man whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) does choose, he [shall be] holy: [you 2f take] too much upon you, you 2f sons of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner]."
Numbers,16,8,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto Korakh [Bald] , Hear, I pray you, you 2f sons of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner]:"
Numbers,16,9," [Seems it but] a small thing unto you, that the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] has separated you from the congregation of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?"
Numbers,16,10,"And he has brought you i near [to him] , and all you i brethren the sons of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] with you i : and seek you 2f the priesthood also?"
Numbers,16,11,"For which cause [both] you i and all you i company [are] gathered together against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and what [is] Aharon [Bright, Very High] , that you 2f murmur against him?"
Numbers,16,12,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] sent to call Datan [belonging to a fountain] and Aviram [My Father is Exalted] , the sons of ‘Eli’av [My Father is God] : which said, We will not come up:"
Numbers,16,13," [Is it] a small thing that you i have brought us up out of a land that flows with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except you i make yourself altogether a prince over us?"
Numbers,16,14,"Moreover you i have not brought us into a land that flows with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: will you i put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up."
Numbers,16,15,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] was very exceedingly angry, and said unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Respect not you i their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them."
Numbers,16,16,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto Korakh [Bald] , Be you i and all you i company before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , you i , and they, and Aharon [Bright, Very High] , tomorrow:"
Numbers,16,17,"And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring you 2f before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; you i also, and Aharon [Bright, Very High] , each [of you] his censer."
Numbers,16,18,"And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and Aharon [Bright, Very High]."
Numbers,16,19,And Korakh [Bald] gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) appeared unto all the congregation.
Numbers,16,20,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and unto Aharon [Bright, Very High] , saying,"
Numbers,16,21,"Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment."
Numbers,16,22,"And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you i be exceedingly angry with all the congregation?"
Numbers,16,23,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying,"
Numbers,16,24,"Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korakh [Bald] , Datan [belonging to a fountain] , and Aviram [My Father is Exalted]."
Numbers,16,25,And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] rose up and went unto Datan [belonging to a fountain] and Aviram [My Father is Exalted] ; and the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] followed him.
Numbers,16,26,"And he spoke unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you 2f be consumed in all their sins."
Numbers,16,27,"So they got up from the tabernacle of Korakh [Bald] , Datan [belonging to a fountain] , and Aviram [My Father is Exalted] , on every side: and Datan [belonging to a fountain] and Aviram [My Father is Exalted] came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children."
Numbers,16,28,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said, Hereby you 2f shall know that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has sent me to do all these works; for [I have] not [done them] of my own mind."
Numbers,16,29,"If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; [then] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has not sent me."
Numbers,16,30,"But if the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow (to approve, commend, accept) them up, with all that [appertain (to belong to; to pertain to)] unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then you 2f shall understand that these men have provoked the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Numbers,16,31,"And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that [was] under them:"
Numbers,16,32,"And the earth opened her mouth, and swallow (to approve, commend, accept) ed them up, and their houses, and all the men that [appertained] unto Korakh [Bald] , and all [their] goods."
Numbers,16,33,"They, and all that [appertained] to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation."
Numbers,16,34,"And all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that [were] round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow (to approve, commend, accept) us up [also]."
Numbers,16,35,"And there came out a fire from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense."
Numbers,16,36,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying,"
Numbers,16,37,"Speak unto El’azar [God has helped] the son of Aharon [Bright, Very High] the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter you i the fire yonder; for they are consecrated."
Numbers,16,38,"The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates [for] a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , therefore they are consecrated: and they shall be a sign unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Numbers,16,39,"And El’azar [God has helped] the priest took the brazen censers, which they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad [plates for] a covering of the altar:"
Numbers,16,40," [To be] a memorial unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that no stranger, which [is] not of the seed of Aharon [Bright, Very High] , come near to offer incense before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; that he be not as Korakh [Bald] , and as his company: as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said to him by the hand of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Numbers,16,41,"But on the morrow all the congregation of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] murmured against Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and against Aharon [Bright, Very High] , saying, You 2f have killed the people of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Numbers,16,42,"And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and against Aharon [Bright, Very High] , that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) appeared."
Numbers,16,43,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and Aharon [Bright, Very High] came before the tabernacle of the congregation."
Numbers,16,44,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying,"
Numbers,16,45,"Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces."
Numbers,16,46,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto Aharon [Bright, Very High] , Take a censer, and put fire in it from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; the plague is begun."
Numbers,16,47,"And Aharon [Bright, Very High] took as Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people."
Numbers,16,48,And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was detained (held).
Numbers,16,49,"Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korakh [Bald]."
Numbers,16,50,"And Aharon [Bright, Very High] returned unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was detained (held)."
Numbers,17,1,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying,"
Numbers,17,2,"Speak unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of [their] fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write you i every man’s name upon his rod."
Numbers,17,3,"And you i shall write Aharon [Bright, Very High] ’s name upon the rod of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] : for one rod [shall be] for the head of the house of their fathers."
Numbers,17,4,"And you i shall lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you."
Numbers,17,5,"And it shall come to pass, [that] the man’s rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , whereby they murmur against you."
Numbers,17,6,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] spoke unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, [even] twelve rods: and the rod of Aharon [Bright, Very High] [was] among their rods."
Numbers,17,7,And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] laid up the rods before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in the tabernacle of witness.
Numbers,17,8,"And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aharon [Bright, Very High] for the house of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds."
Numbers,17,9,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] brought out all the rods from before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto all the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and they looked, and took every man his rod."
Numbers,17,10,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , Bring Aharon [Bright, Very High] ’s rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and you i shall quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not."
Numbers,17,11,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] did [so] : as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded him, so did he."
Numbers,17,12,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish."
Numbers,17,13,Whosoever comes anything near unto the tabernacle of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

Numbers,19,16,"And whosoever touches one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days."
Numbers,19,17,"And for an unclean [person] they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:"
Numbers,19,18,"And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip [it] in the water, and sprinkle [it] upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:"
Numbers,19,19,"And the clean [person] shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even."
Numbers,19,20,"But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : the water of separation has not been sprinkled upon him; he [is] unclean."
Numbers,19,21,"And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkles the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that touches the water of separation shall be unclean until even."
Numbers,19,22,And whatsoever the unclean [person] touches shall be unclean; and the soul that touches [it] shall be unclean until even.
Numbers,20,1,"Then came the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [even] the whole congregation, into the desert of Tzin [Flat] in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh [Holy] ; and Miryam [rebellion] died there, and was buried there."
Numbers,20,2,"And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and against Aharon [Bright, Very High]."
Numbers,20,3,"And the people chastised with Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , and spoke, saying, Would God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] that we had died when our brethren died before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)!"
Numbers,20,4,"And why have you 2f brought up the congregation of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?"
Numbers,20,5,"And wherefore have you 2f made us to come up out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , to bring us in unto this evil place? it [is] no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither [is] there any water to drink."
Numbers,20,6,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and Aharon [Bright, Very High] went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) appeared unto them."
Numbers,20,7,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying,"
Numbers,20,8,"Take the rod, and gather you i the assembly together, you i , and Aharon [Bright, Very High] you i brother, and speak you 2f unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and you i shall bring forth to them water out of the rock: so you i shall give the congregation and their beasts drink."
Numbers,20,9,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] took the rod from before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , as he commanded him."
Numbers,20,10,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and Aharon [Bright, Very High] gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, you 2f rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?"
Numbers,20,11,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] lifted up his hand, and with his rod he struck the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts [also]."
Numbers,20,12,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and Aharon [Bright, Very High] , Because you 2f believed me not, to sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) me in the eyes of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , therefore you 2f shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them."
Numbers,20,13,"This [is] the water of M’rivah [Arguing] ; because the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] strove with the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and he was sanctified in them."
Numbers,20,14,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] sent messengers from Kadesh [Holy] unto the king of Edom [Red] , Thus says you i brother Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , you i know all the travail that has befallen us:"
Numbers,20,15,"How our fathers went down into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and we have dwelt in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] a long time; and the Mitzri vexed us, and our fathers:"
Numbers,20,16,"And when we cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and has brought us forth out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : and, behold, we [are] in Kadesh [Holy] , a city in the uttermost of you i border:"
Numbers,20,17,"Let us pass, I pray you i , through you i country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink [of] the water of the wells: we will go by the king’s [high] way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed you i borders."
Numbers,20,18,"And Edom [Red] said unto him, you i shall not pass by me, lest I come out against you i with the sword."
Numbers,20,19,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of you i water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without [doing] anything [else] , go through on my feet."
Numbers,20,20,"And he said, you i shall not go through. And Edom [Red] came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand."
Numbers,20,21,Thus Edom [Red] refused to give Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] passage through his border: wherefore Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] turned away from him.
Numbers,20,22,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [even] the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh [Holy] , and came unto mount Hor [Mountain Peak]."
Numbers,20,23,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and Aharon [Bright, Very High] in mount Hor [Mountain Peak] , by the coast of the land of Edom [Red] , saying,"
Numbers,20,24,"Aharon [Bright, Very High] shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , because you 2f rebelled against my word at the water of M’rivah [Arguing]."
Numbers,20,25,"Take Aharon [Bright, Very High] and El’azar [God has helped] his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor [Mountain Peak]:"
Numbers,20,26,"And strip Aharon [Bright, Very High] of his garments, and put them upon El’azar [God has helped] his son: and Aharon [Bright, Very High] shall be gathered [unto his people] , and shall die there."
Numbers,20,27,And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] did as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded: and they went up into mount Hor [Mountain Peak] in the sight of all the congregation.
Numbers,20,28,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] stripped Aharon [Bright, Very High] of his garments, and put them upon El’azar [God has helped] his son; and Aharon [Bright, Very High] died there in the top of the mount: and Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and El’azar [God has helped] came down from the mount."
Numbers,20,29,"And when all the congregation saw that Aharon [Bright, Very High] was dead, they mourned for Aharon [Bright, Very High] thirty days, [even] all the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Numbers,21,1,"And [when] king ‘Arad [A Wild Ass] the Kena’ani [Merchants] , which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and took [some] of them prisoners."
Numbers,21,2,"And Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] vowed a vow unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, If you i will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities."
Numbers,21,3,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) listened to the voice of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and delivered up the Kena’ani [Merchant] ; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah [Asylum]."
Numbers,21,4,"And they journeyed from mount Hor [Mountain Peak] by the way of the Red sea, to compass (go around, encircle; encompass) the land of Edom [Red] : and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way."
Numbers,21,5,"And the people spoke against God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and against Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , For what reason have you 2f brought us up out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] to die in the wilderness? for [there is] no bread, neither [is there any] water; and our soul loathes this light bread."
Numbers,21,6,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] died."
Numbers,21,7,"Therefore the people came to Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and against you i ; pray unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that he take away the serpents from us. And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] prayed for the people."
Numbers,21,8,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , Make you i a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looks upon it, shall live."
Numbers,21,9,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived."
Numbers,21,10,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] set forward, and pitched in Ovot [Waterskins]."
Numbers,21,11,"And they journeyed from Ovot [Waterskins] , and pitched at ‘Iyei-Ha’avarim [Ruins of Regions Beyond] , in the wilderness which [is] before Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , toward the sunrising."
Numbers,21,12,"From there they removed, and pitched in the Vadi Zared [“Flexible Twig of a Willow Tree” Brook]."
Numbers,21,13,"From there they removed, and pitched on the other side of ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] , which [is] in the wilderness that comes out of the coasts of the Emori [Highlanders] : for ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] [is] the border of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , between Mo’av [Seed of my Father] and the Emori [Highlanders]."
Numbers,21,14,"For what reason it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream],"
Numbers,21,15,"And at the stream of the brooks that goes down to the dwelling of ‘Ar [A City] , and lies upon the border of Mo’av [Seed of my Father]."
Numbers,21,16,"And from there [they went] to Be’er [Well] : that [is] the well whereof the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , Gather the people together, and I will give them water."
Numbers,21,17,"Then Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing you 2f unto it:"
Numbers,21,18,"The princes excavated the well, the nobles of the people excavated it, by [the direction of] the lawgiver, with their rods (clubs) . And from the wilderness [they went] to Mattanah [Gift of Jehovah]:"
Numbers,21,19,And from Mattanah [Gift of Jehovah] to Nachali’el [Torrents of God] : and from Nachali’el [Torrents of God] to Bamot [Great High Place]:
Numbers,21,20,"And from Bamot [Great High Place] [in] the valley, that [is] in the country of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , to the top of Pisgah [Cleft (split hoof; an opening, break or split) Mountain Range], which looks toward Y’shim’on [Wasteland]."
Numbers,21,21,"And Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] sent messengers unto Sichon [Warrior] king of the Emori [Highlanders] , saying,"
Numbers,21,22,"Let me pass through you i land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink [of] the waters of the well: [but] we will go along by the king’s [high] way, until we be past you i borders."
Numbers,21,23,"And Sichon [Warrior] would not suffer Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to pass through his border: but Sichon [Warrior] gathered all his people together, and went out against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] into the wilderness: and he came to Yachatz [Trampled Down] , and fought against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Numbers,21,24,"And Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] unto Yabok [luxuriant emptying river] , even unto the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] : for the border of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] [was] strong."
Numbers,21,25,"And Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] took all these cities: and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] dwelt in all the cities of the Emori [Highlanders] , in Heshbon [Stronghold] , and in all the villages thereof."
Numbers,21,26,"For Heshbon [Stronghold] [was] the city of Sichon [Warrior] the king of the Emori [Highlanders] , who had fought against the former king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream]."
Numbers,21,27,"For what reason they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon [Stronghold] , let the city of Sichon [Warrior] be built and prepared:"
Numbers,21,28,"For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon [Stronghold] , a flame from the city of Sichon [Warrior] : it has consumed ‘Ar [A City] of Mo’av [Seed of my Father], [and] the lords of the high places of ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream]."
Numbers,21,29,"Woe to you i , Mo’av [Seed of my Father] ! you i are undone, O people of K’mosh [Subduer] : he has given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sichon [Warrior] king of the Emori [Highlanders]."
Numbers,21,30,"We have shot at them; Heshbon [Stronghold] is perished even unto Divon [Wasting] , and we have laid them waste even unto Nofach [Blast] , which [reaches] unto Meidva [Water of Rest]."
Numbers,21,31,Thus Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] dwelt in the land of the Emori [Highlanders].
Numbers,21,32,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] sent to spy out Ya’zer [Helped] , and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Emori [Highlanders] that [were] there."
Numbers,21,33,"And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan [Fruitful] : and ‘Og [Long-necked] the king of Bashan [Fruitful] went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edre’i [Good Pasture]."
Numbers,21,34,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , Fear him not: for I have delivered him into you i hand, and all his people, and his land; and you i shall do to him as you i did unto Sichon [Warrior] king of the Emori [Highlanders] , which dwelt at Heshbon [Stronghold]."
Numbers,21,35,"So they struck him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land."
Numbers,22,1,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] set forward, and pitched in the plains of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] on this side Yarden [Descender] [by] Yericho [Its Moon]."
Numbers,22,2,And Balak [Devastator] the son of Zippor [Sparrow] saw all that Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] had done to the Emori [Highlanders].
Numbers,22,3,"And Mo’av [Seed of my Father] was sore afraid of the people, because they [were] many: and Mo’av [Seed of my Father] was distressed because of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Numbers,22,4,"And Mo’av [Seed of my Father] said unto the elders of Midyan [Strife] , Now shall this company lick up all [that are] round about us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field. And Balak [Devastator] the son of Zippor [Sparrow] [was] king of the Mo’avi [of his father] at that time."
Numbers,22,5,"He sent messengers therefore unto Bil’am [Not of the People] the son of B’or [Burning] to P’tor [Soothsayer (one who fortells the future by ungodly means)] , which [is] by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:"
Numbers,22,6,"Come now therefore, I pray you i , curse me this people; for they [are] too mighty for me: perhaps I shall prevail, [that] we may strike them, and [that] I may drive them out of the land: for I know that he whom you i bless [is] Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) , and he whom you i curse is cursed."
Numbers,22,7,"And the elders of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] and the elders of Midyan [Strife] departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Bil’am [Not of the People] , and spoke unto him the words of Balak [Devastator]."
Numbers,22,8,"And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall speak unto me: and the princes of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] abode with Bil’am [Not of the People]."
Numbers,22,9,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] came unto Bil’am [Not of the People] , and said, What men [are] these with you i?"
Numbers,22,10,"And Bil’am [Not of the People] said unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , Balak [Devastator] the son of Zippor [Sparrow] , king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , has sent unto me, [saying],"
Numbers,22,11,"Behold, [there is] a people come out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , which covers the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; perhaps I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out."
Numbers,22,12,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] said unto Bil’am [Not of the People] , you i shall not go with them; you i shall not curse the people: for they [are] Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)."
Numbers,22,13,"And Bil’am [Not of the People] rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak [Devastator] , Get you into your land: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) refuses to give me leave to go with you."
Numbers,22,14,"And the princes of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] rose up, and they went unto Balak [Devastator] , and said, Bil’am [Not of the People] refuses to come with us."
Numbers,22,15,"And Balak [Devastator] sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they."
Numbers,22,16,"And they came to Bil’am [Not of the People] , and said to him, Thus says Balak [Devastator] the son of Zippor [Sparrow] , Let nothing, I pray you i , hinder you i from coming unto me:"
Numbers,22,17,"For I will promote you i unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever you i say unto me: come therefore, I pray you i , curse me this people."
Numbers,22,18,"And Bil’am [Not of the People] answered and said unto the servants of Balak [Devastator] , If Balak [Devastator] would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , to do less or more."
Numbers,22,19,"Now therefore, I pray you, wait you 2f also here this night, that I may know what the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will say unto me more."
Numbers,22,20,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] came unto Bil’am [Not of the People] at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call you i , rise up, [and] go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto you i , that shall you i do."
Numbers,22,21,"And Bil’am [Not of the People] rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Mo’av [Seed of my Father]."
Numbers,22,22,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants [were] with him."
Numbers,22,23,"And the ass saw the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Bil’am [Not of the People] struck the ass, to turn her into the way."
Numbers,22,24,"But the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall [being] on this side, and a wall on that side."
Numbers,22,25,"And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Bil’am [Not of the People] ’s foot against the wall: and he struck her again."
Numbers,22,26,"And the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) went further, and stood in a narrow place, where [was] no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left."
Numbers,22,27,"And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , she fell down under Bil’am [Not of the People] : and Bil’am [Not of the People] ’s anger was kindled, and he struck the ass with a staff."
Numbers,22,28,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Bil’am [Not of the People] , What have I done unto you i , that you i have smitten me these three times?"
Numbers,22,29,"And Bil’am [Not of the People] said unto the ass, Because you i have mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill you i."
Numbers,22,30,"And the ass said unto Bil’am [Not of the People], [Am] not I you i ass, upon which you i have ridden ever since [I was] you i unto this day? was I ever won’t to do so unto you i ? And he said, No."
Numbers,22,31,"Then the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) opened the eyes of Bil’am [Not of the People] , and he saw the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face."
Numbers,22,32,"And the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto him, For what reason have you i smitten you i ass these three times? behold, I went out that is to withstand you i , because [you i ] way is perverse before me:"
Numbers,22,33,"And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain you i , and saved her alive."
Numbers,22,34,"And Bil’am [Not of the People] said unto the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , I have sinned; for I knew not that you i stood in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease you i , I will get me back again."
Numbers,22,35,"And the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Bil’am [Not of the People] , Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto you i , that you i shall speak. So Bil’am [Not of the People] went with the princes of Balak [Devastator]."
Numbers,22,36,"And when Balak [Devastator] heard that Bil’am [Not of the People] was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , which [is] in the border of ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] , which [is] in the utmost coast."
Numbers,22,37,"And Balak [Devastator] said unto Bil’am [Not of the People] , Did I not earnestly send unto you i to call you i ? wherefore came you i not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote you i to honour?"
Numbers,22,38,"And Bil’am [Not of the People] said unto Balak [Devastator] , Lo, I am come unto you i : have I now any power at all to (to do entirely, do wholly) say anything? the word that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] puts in my mouth, that shall I speak."
Numbers,22,39,"And Bil’am [Not of the People] went with Balak [Devastator] , and they came unto Kiryat-Hutzot [City of Streets]."
Numbers,22,40,"And Balak [Devastator] offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Bil’am [Not of the People] , and to the princes that [were] with him."
Numbers,22,41,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak [Devastator] took Bil’am [Not of the People] , and brought him up into the high places of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , that there he might see the utmost [part] of the people."
Numbers,23,1,"And Bil’am [Not of the People] said unto Balak [Devastator] , Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams."
Numbers,23,2,And Balak [Devastator] did as Bil’am [Not of the People] had spoken; and Balak [Devastator] and Bil’am [Not of the People] offered on [every] altar a bullock and a ram.
Numbers,23,3,"And Bil’am [Not of the People] said unto Balak [Devastator] , Stand by you i burnt offering, and I will go: perhaps the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will come to meet me: and whatsoever he shows me I will tell you i . And he went to an high place."
Numbers,23,4,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] met Bil’am [Not of the People] : and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon [every] altar a bullock and a ram."
Numbers,23,5,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) put a word in Bil’am [Not of the People] ’s mouth, and said, Return unto Balak [Devastator] , and thus you i shall speak."
Numbers,23,6,"And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Mo’av [Seed of my Father]."
Numbers,23,7,"And he took up his parable, and said, Balak [Devastator] the king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] has brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, [saying] , Come, curse me Ya’akov [Heal of God] , and come, defy Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Numbers,23,8,"How shall I curse, whom God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has not cursed? or how shall I defy, [whom] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has not defied?"
Numbers,23,9,"For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations."

Numbers,35,10,"Speak unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and say unto them, When you 2f be come over Yarden [Descender] into the land of Kena’an [Merchant];"
Numbers,35,11,"Then you 2f shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee there, which kills any person at unawares."
Numbers,35,12,"And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment."
Numbers,35,13,And of these cities which you 2f shall give six cities shall you 2f have for refuge.
Numbers,35,14,"You 2f shall give three cities on this side Yarden [Descender] , and three cities shall you 2f give in the land of Kena’an [Merchant], [which] shall be cities of refuge."
Numbers,35,15,"These six cities shall be a refuge, [both] for the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that kills any person unawares may flee there."
Numbers,35,16,"And if he strike him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he [is] a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,17,"And if he strike him with throwing a stone, which he may die, and he die, he [is] a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,18,"Or [if] he strike him with an hand weapon of wood, which he may die, and he die, he [is] a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,19,"The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meets him, he shall slay him."
Numbers,35,20,"But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;"
Numbers,35,21,"Or in hatred (being an enemy) strike him with his hand, that he die: he that struck [him] shall surely be put to death; [for] he [is] a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meets him."
Numbers,35,22,"But if he thrust him suddenly without hatred (being an enemy) , or have cast upon him anything without laying of wait,"
Numbers,35,23,"Or with any stone, which a man may die, seeing [him] not, and cast [it] upon him, that he die, and [was] not his enemy, neither sought his harm:"
Numbers,35,24,Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:
Numbers,35,25,"And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, to which he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the High Priest, which was anointed with the holy oil."
Numbers,35,26,"But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, to which he was fled;"
Numbers,35,27,"And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:"
Numbers,35,28,Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the High Priest: but after the death of the High Priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.
Numbers,35,29,So these [things] shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Numbers,35,30,"Whoso kills any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person [to cause him] to die."
Numbers,35,31,"Moreover you 2f shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which [is] guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death."
Numbers,35,32,"And you 2f shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest."
Numbers,35,33,"So you 2f shall not pollute the land wherein you 2f [are] : for blood it defiles the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed in it, but by the blood of him that shed it."
Numbers,35,34,"Defile not therefore the land which you 2f shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) dwell among the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Numbers,36,1,"And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , the son of Makhir [Sold] , the son of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , of the families of the sons of Yosef [(God) He Shall Add] , came near, and spoke before Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , and before the princes, the chief fathers of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]:"
Numbers,36,2,"And they said, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and my lord was commanded by the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to give the inheritance of Tz’lof’chad [First-Born] our brother unto his daughters."
Numbers,36,3,"And if they be married to any of the sons of the [other] tribes of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance."
Numbers,36,4,"And when the jubilee of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers."
Numbers,36,5,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] commanded the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, The tribe of the sons of Yosef [(God) He Shall Add] has said well."
Numbers,36,6,"This [is] the thing which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) does command concerning the daughters of Tz’lof’chad [First-Born] , saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry."
Numbers,36,7,So shall not the inheritance of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
Numbers,36,8,"And every daughter, that possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers."
Numbers,36,9,Neither shall the inheritance remove from [one] tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall keep himself to his own inheritance.
Numbers,36,10,"Even as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , so did the daughters of Tz’lof’chad [First-Born]:"
Numbers,36,11,"For Machlah [Disease] , Tirtzah [Favorable] , and Hoglah [Partidge] , and Machlah [Queen] , and No’ah [Motion] , the daughters of Tz’lof’chad [First-Born] , were married unto their father’s brothers’ sons:"
Numbers,36,12," [And] they were married into the families of the sons of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] the son of Yosef [(God) He Shall Add] , and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father."
Numbers,36,13,"These [are] the commandments and the judgments, which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded by the hand of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in the plains of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] by Yarden [Descender] [near] Yericho [Its Moon]."
