2 Chronicles,5,13,"It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers [were] as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and when they lifted up [their] voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [saying] , For [he is] good; for his mercy [endures] forever: that [then] the house was filled with a cloud, [even] the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate);"
2 Chronicles,5,14,So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had filled the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered].
2 Chronicles,6,1,"Then said Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness."

2 Chronicles,6,6,"But I have chosen Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , that my name might be there; and have chosen David [beloved] to be over my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,6,7,Now it was in the heart of David [beloved] my father to build an house for the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
2 Chronicles,6,8,"But the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said to David [beloved] my father, Forasmuch as it was in you i heart to build an house for my name, you i did well in that it was in you i heart:"

2 Chronicles,6,12,"And he stood before the altar of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in the presence of all the congregation of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and spread forth his hands:"
2 Chronicles,6,13,"For Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and spread forth his hands toward heaven,"
2 Chronicles,6,14,"And said, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [there is] no God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] like you i in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keeps covenant, and [shows] mercy unto you i servants, that walk before you i with all their hearts:"

2 Chronicles,7,21,"And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passes by it; so that he shall say, Why has the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) done thus unto this land, and unto this house?"

2 Chronicles,11,18,"And Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] took him Mahalath the daughter of Yerimot [He is Most High] the son of David [beloved] to wife, [and] Avichayil [Father of Strength] the daughter of ‘Eli’av [My Father is God] the son of Yishai [I possess];"
2 Chronicles,11,19,"Which bore him children; Ye’ush [He hurries to aid] , and Sh’maryah [kept by Yehovah] , and Zaham [loathing]."
2 Chronicles,11,20,"And after her he took Ma’akhah [oppression] the daughter of Avshalom [my father is peace] ; which bore him Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father] , and ‘Atai [opportune] , and Ziza [shining] , and Shlomit [Peaceful]."
2 Chronicles,11,21,"And Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] loved Ma’akhah [oppression] the daughter of Avshalom [my father is peace] above all his wives and his concubines (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)"
2 Chronicles,11,22,"And Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] made Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father] the son of Ma’akhah [oppression] the chief, [to be] ruler among his brethren: for [he thought] to make him king."
2 Chronicles,11,23,"And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives."
2 Chronicles,12,1,"And it came to pass, when Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with him."
2 Chronicles,12,2,"And it came to pass, [that] in the fifth year of king Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] Shishak [greedy of fine linen] king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] came up against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , because they had transgressed against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate),"
2 Chronicles,12,3,"With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people [were] without number that came with him out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ; the Luvim [empty-hearted] , the Suki’im [booth dwellers] , and the Cushi [Ethiopians]."
2 Chronicles,12,4,"And he took the fenced cities which [pertained] to Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and came to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Chronicles,12,5,"Then came Sh’may’yah [Yehovah hears] the prophet to Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] , and [to] the princes of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , that were gathered together to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] because of Shishak [greedy of fine linen] , and said unto them, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , You 2f have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak [greedy of fine linen]."
2 Chronicles,12,6,"Whereupon the princes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] righteous."
2 Chronicles,12,7,"And when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came to Sh’may’yah [Yehovah hears] , saying, They have humbled themselves; [therefore] I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] by the hand of Shishak [greedy of fine linen]."
2 Chronicles,12,8,"Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries."
2 Chronicles,12,9,"So Shishak [greedy of fine linen] king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] came up against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and took away the treasures of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the treasures of the king’s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] had made."
2 Chronicles,12,10,"Instead of which king Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] made shields of brass, and committed [them] to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king’s house."
2 Chronicles,12,11,"And when the king entered into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber."
2 Chronicles,12,12,"And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) turned from him, that he would not destroy [him] altogether: and also in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] things went well."
2 Chronicles,12,13,"So king Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] strengthened himself in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and reigned: for Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] [was] one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , the city which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had chosen out of all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , to put his name there. And his mother’s name [was] Na’amah [Loveliness] an ‘Amonit [tribal]."
2 Chronicles,12,14,"And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Chronicles,12,15,"Now the acts of Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] , first and last, [are] they not written in the book of Sh’may’yah [Yehovah hears] the prophet, and of ‘Iddo [His witness] the seer concerning genealogies? And [there were] wars between Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] and Yarov’am [the people will contend] continually."
2 Chronicles,12,16,"And Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David [beloved] : and Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father] his son reigned in his stead."
2 Chronicles,13,1,Now in the eighteenth year of king Yarov’am [the people will contend] began Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father] to reign over Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised].
2 Chronicles,13,2,He reigned three years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . His mother’s name also [was] Mikhayah [who is like God?] the daughter of Uri’el [God is my light] of Giv’ah [Hill] . And there was war between Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father] and Yarov’am [the people will contend].
2 Chronicles,13,3,"And Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father] set the battle in array (to put on; to clothe) with an army of valiant men of war, [even] four hundred thousand chosen men: Yarov’am [the people will contend] also set the battle in array (to put on; to clothe) against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, [being] mighty men of valour."
2 Chronicles,13,4,"And Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father] stood up upon mount Tz’marayim [Double Fleece of Wool] , which [is] in mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , and said, Hear me, you i Yarov’am [the people will contend] , and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God];"
2 Chronicles,13,5,"Ought you 2f not to know that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] gave the kingdom over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to David [beloved] forever, [even] to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?"
2 Chronicles,13,6,"Yet Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , the servant of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] the son of David [beloved] , is risen up, and has rebelled against his lord."
2 Chronicles,13,7,"And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial [Worthless, Good for Nothing] , and have strengthened themselves against Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] the son of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , when Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them."
2 Chronicles,13,8,"And now you 2f think that is to withstand the kingdom of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in the hand of the sons of David [beloved] ; and you 2f [be] a great multitude, and [there are] with you golden calves, which Yarov’am [the people will contend] made you for gods."
2 Chronicles,13,9,"Have you 2f not cast out the priests of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the sons of Aharon [Bright, Very High] , and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of [other] lands? so that whosoever comes to consecrate (treat as set apart or separate unto God) himself with a young bullock and seven rams, [the same] may be a priest of [them that are] no gods."
2 Chronicles,13,10,"But as for us, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [are] the sons of Aharon [Bright, Very High] , and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] [wait] upon [their] business:"
2 Chronicles,13,11,"And they burn unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the showbread also [set they in order] upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; but you 2f have forsaken him."
2 Chronicles,13,12,"And, behold, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] himself [is] with us for [our] captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , fight you 2f not against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of your fathers; for you 2f shall not prosper."
2 Chronicles,13,13,"But Yarov’am [the people will contend] caused an ambush to come about behind them: so they were before Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and the ambush [was] behind them."
2 Chronicles,13,14,"And when Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] looked back, behold, the battle [was] before and behind: and they cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the priests sounded with the trumpets."
2 Chronicles,13,15,"Then the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] gave a shout: and as the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] shouted, it came to pass, that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] struck Yarov’am [the people will contend] and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] before Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father] and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
2 Chronicles,13,16,And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] fled before Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] : and God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] delivered them into their hand.
2 Chronicles,13,17,And Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father] and his people killed them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] five hundred thousand chosen men.
2 Chronicles,13,18,"Thus the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were brought under at that time, and the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] prevailed, because they relied upon the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,13,19,"And Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father] pursued after Yarov’am [the people will contend] , and took cities from him, Beit-El [House of God] with the towns thereof, and Y’shanah [storage] with the towns thereof, and ‘Efrayin [fawn-like] with the towns thereof."
2 Chronicles,13,20,"Neither did Yarov’am [the people will contend] recover strength again in the days of Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father] : and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) struck him, and he died."
2 Chronicles,13,21,"But Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father] waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters."
2 Chronicles,13,22,"And the rest of the acts of Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father] , and his ways, and his sayings, [are] written in the story of the prophet ‘Iddo [His witness]."
2 Chronicles,14,1,"So Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father] slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David [beloved] : and Asa [healer; injurious?] his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years."
2 Chronicles,14,2,And Asa [healer; injurious?] did [that which was] good and right in the eyes of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]:
2 Chronicles,14,3,"For he took away the altars of the strange [gods] , and the high places, and broke down the images, and cut down the groves:"
2 Chronicles,14,4,"And commanded Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] to seek the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] f their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment."
2 Chronicles,14,5,Also he took away out of all the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.
2 Chronicles,14,6,"And he built fenced cities in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] : for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had given him rest."
2 Chronicles,14,7,"Therefore he said unto Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , Let us build these cities, and make about [them] walls, and towers, gates, and bars, [while] the land [is] yet before us; because we have sought the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , we have sought [him] , and he has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered."
2 Chronicles,14,8,"And Asa [healer; injurious?] had an army [of men] that bore targets and spears, out of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] three hundred thousand; and out of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these [were] mighty men of valour."
2 Chronicles,14,9,"And there came out against them Zerach [Rising] the Cushi (Ethiopian) with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah [Crest of a Hill]."
2 Chronicles,14,10,"Then Asa [healer; injurious?] went out against him, and they set the battle in array (to put on; to clothe) in the valley of Tz’fat [watch-tower] at Mareshah [Crest of a Hill]."
2 Chronicles,14,11,"And Asa [healer; injurious?] cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and said, Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [it is] nothing with you i to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; for we rest on you i , and in you i name we go against this multitude. O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , you i [are] our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; let not man prevail against you i."
2 Chronicles,14,12,"So the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) struck the Cushi [Ethiopians] before Asa [healer; injurious?] , and before Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ; and the Cushi [Ethiopians] fled."
2 Chronicles,14,13,"And Asa [healer; injurious?] and the people that [were] with him pursued them unto Gera [A Grain] r: and the Cushi [Ethiopians] were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil (plunder; prey; booty)."
2 Chronicles,14,14,And they struck all the cities round about Gera [A Grain] r; for the fear of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil (plunder; prey; booty) in them.
2 Chronicles,14,15,"They struck also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Chronicles,15,1,And the Spirit of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] came upon ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] the son of ‘Oded [restorer]:
2 Chronicles,15,2,"And he went out to meet Asa [healer; injurious?] , and said unto him, Hear you 2f me, Asa [healer; injurious?] , and all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] ; The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] with you, while you 2f be with him; and if you 2f seek him, he will be found of you; but if you 2f forsake him, he will forsake you."
2 Chronicles,15,3,"Now for a long season Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [has been] without the true God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and without a teaching priest, and without law."
2 Chronicles,15,4,"But when they in their trouble did turn unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and sought him, he was found of them."
2 Chronicles,15,5,"And in those times [there was] no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations [were] upon all the inhabitants of the countries."
2 Chronicles,15,6,"And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] did vex them with all adversity."
2 Chronicles,15,7,"Be you 2f strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded."
2 Chronicles,15,8,"And when Asa [healer; injurious?] heard these words, and the prophecy of ‘Oded [restorer] the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , and renewed the altar of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that [was] before the porch of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Chronicles,15,9,"And he gathered all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , and the strangers with them out of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] and M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , and out of Shim’on [he who hears] : for they fell to him out of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in abundance, when they saw that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [was] with him."
2 Chronicles,15,10,"So they gathered themselves together at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa [healer; injurious?]."
2 Chronicles,15,11,"And they offered unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) the same time, of the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) [which] they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep."
2 Chronicles,15,12,And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
2 Chronicles,15,13,"That whosoever would not seek the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman."
2 Chronicles,15,14,"And they swore unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets."
2 Chronicles,15,15,"And all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) gave them rest round about."
2 Chronicles,15,16,"And also [concerning] Ma’akhah [oppression] the mother of Asa [healer; injurious?] the king, he removed her from [being] queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa [healer; injurious?] cut down her idol, and stamped [it] , and burnt [it] at the brook Kidron [dark]."
2 Chronicles,15,17,But the high places were not taken away out of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : nevertheless the heart of Asa [healer; injurious?] was perfect all his days.
2 Chronicles,15,18,"And he brought into the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels."
2 Chronicles,15,19,And there was no [more] war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa [healer; injurious?].
2 Chronicles,16,1,"In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa [healer; injurious?] Ba’sha [wicked] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came up against Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and built Ramah [Hill] , to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa [healer; injurious?] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
2 Chronicles,16,2,"Then Asa [healer; injurious?] brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben [son] -Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] king of Aram [exalted] (Syria) [exalted] , that dwelt at Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] , saying,"
2 Chronicles,16,3," [There is] a league between me and you i , as [there was] between my father and you i father: behold, I have sent you i silver and gold; go, break you i league with Ba’sha [wicked] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that he may depart from me."
2 Chronicles,16,4,"And Ben [son] -Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] listened unto king Asa [healer; injurious?] , and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and they struck ‘Iyon [a ruin] , and Dan [Judge] , and Avel-Mayim [meadow of waters] , and all the store cities of Naftali [My Wrestling]."
2 Chronicles,16,5,"And it came to pass, when Ba’sha [wicked] heard [it] , that he left off building of Ramah [Hill] , and let his work cease."
2 Chronicles,16,6,"Then Asa [healer; injurious?] the king took all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ; and they carried away the stones of Ramah [Hill] , and the timber thereof, which Ba’sha [wicked] was building; and he built with that Geva [hill] and Mitzpah [watchtower]."
2 Chronicles,16,7,"And at that time Hanani [gracious] the seer came to Asa [healer; injurious?] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and said unto him, Because you i have relied on the king of Aram [exalted] (Syria) [exalted] , and not relied on the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , therefore is the host of the king of Aram [exalted] (Syria) [exalted] escaped out of you i hand."
2 Chronicles,16,8,"Were not the Cushi [Ethiopians] and the Luvim [empty-hearted] a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because you i did rely on the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , he delivered them into your i hand."
2 Chronicles,16,9,"For the eyes of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of [them] whose heart [is] perfect toward him. Herein you i have done foolishly: therefore from from this time forth (from now on) you i shall have wars."
2 Chronicles,16,10,"Then Asa [healer; injurious?] was exceedingly angry with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for [he was] in a rage with him because of this [thing] . And Asa [healer; injurious?] oppressed [some] of the people the same time."
2 Chronicles,16,11,"And, behold, the acts of Asa [healer; injurious?] , first and last, lo, they [are] written in the book of the kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,16,12,"And Asa [healer; injurious?] in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease [was] exceeding [great] : yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , but to the physicians."
2 Chronicles,16,13,"And Asa [healer; injurious?] slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign."
2 Chronicles,16,14,"And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David [beloved] , and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and diverse kinds [of spices] prepared by the apothecaries’ are: and they made a very great burning for him."
2 Chronicles,17,1,"And Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,17,2,"And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and set garrisons in the land of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and in the cities of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , which Asa [healer; injurious?] his father had taken."
2 Chronicles,17,3,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was with Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] , because he walked in the first ways of his father David [beloved] , and sought not unto Ba’alim [lords (false gods)];"
2 Chronicles,17,4,"But sought to the [Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."

2 Chronicles,21,2,"And he had brethren the sons of Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] , ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] , and Jehiel, and Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers] , and ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] , and Mikha’el [Who is Like God?] , and Sh’fatyah [Yehovah has judged] : all these [were] the sons of Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,21,3,"And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] : but the kingdom gave he to Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] ; because he [was] the firstborn."
2 Chronicles,21,4,"Now when Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and killed all his brethren with the sword, and [diverse] also of the princes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,21,5,"Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] [was] thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Chronicles,21,6,"And he walked in the way of the kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , like as did the house of Ach’av [father’s brother] : for he had the daughter of Ach’av [father’s brother] to wife: and he wrought [that which was] evil in the eyes of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Chronicles,21,7,"However the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) would not destroy the house of David [beloved] , because of the covenant that he had made with David [beloved] , and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons forever."
2 Chronicles,21,8,"In his days the Edomi [red] revolted from under the dominion of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and made themselves a king."
2 Chronicles,21,9,"Then Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and struck the Edomi [red] which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots."
2 Chronicles,21,10,So the Edomi [red] revolted from under the hand of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] unto this day. The same time [also] did Livnah [Pavement] revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of his fathers.
2 Chronicles,21,11,"Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and caused the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to commit fornication, and compelled Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] [thereto]."
2 Chronicles,21,12,"And there came a writing to him from Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] the prophet, saying, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of David [beloved] you i father, Because you i have not walked in the ways of Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] you i father, nor in the ways of Asa [healer; injurious?] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised],"
2 Chronicles,21,13,"But have walked in the way of the kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and have made Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to go a whoring, like to the cult prostitution of the house of Ach’av [father’s brother] , and also have slain you i brethren of you i father’s house, [which were] better than yourself:"
2 Chronicles,21,14,"Behold, with a great plague will the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) strike you i people, and you i children, and you i wives, and all you i goods:"
2 Chronicles,21,15,"And you i [shall have] great sickness by disease of you i bowels (inward parts; affections) , until you i bowels (inward parts; affections) fall out by reason of the sickness day by day."
2 Chronicles,21,16,"Moreover the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) stirred up against Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] the spirit of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and of the Arabians, that [were] near the Cushi [Ethiopians]:"
2 Chronicles,21,17,"And they came up into Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] , the youngest of his sons."
2 Chronicles,21,18,And after all this the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) struck him in his bowels (inward parts; affections) with an incurable disease.
2 Chronicles,21,19,"And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels (inward parts; affections) fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers."
2 Chronicles,21,20,"Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] eight years, and departed without being desired. However they buried him in the city of David [beloved] , but not in the sepulchres of the kings."
2 Chronicles,22,1,And the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] made Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] the son of Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] reigned.
2 Chronicles,22,2,"Forty and two years old [was] Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . His mother’s name also [was] ‘Atalyahu [afflicted of the Lord] the daughter of ‘Omri [pupil of Yehovah]."
2 Chronicles,22,3,He also walked in the ways of the house of Ach’av [father’s brother] : for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.
2 Chronicles,22,4,For what reason he did evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) like the house of Ach’av [father’s brother] : for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction.
2 Chronicles,22,5,"He walked also after their counsel, and went with Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] the son of Ach’av [father’s brother] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to war against Haza’el [one who sees God] king of Aram [exalted] (Syria) [exalted] at Ramot-Gil’ad [rocky region] : and the Aram [exalted] [Syrians] struck Yoram [Yehovah is exalted]."
2 Chronicles,22,6,"And he returned to be healed in Yizre’el [God Sows] because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah [Hill] , when he fought with Haza’el [one who sees God] king of Aram [exalted] (Syria) [exalted] . And ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] the son of Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] went down to see Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] the son of Ach’av [father’s brother] at Yizre’el [God Sows] , because he was sick."
2 Chronicles,22,7,"And the destruction of Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] was of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] by coming to Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] : for when he was come, he went out with Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] against Yehu [Yehovah is He] the son of Nimshi [rescued] , whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had anointed to cut off the house of Ach’av [father’s brother]."
2 Chronicles,22,8,"And it came to pass, that, when Yehu [Yehovah is He] was executing judgment upon the house of Ach’av [father’s brother] , and found the princes of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and the sons of the brethren of Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] , that ministered to Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] , he killed them."
2 Chronicles,22,9,"And he sought Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] : and they caught him, (for he was hid in Shomron [watch mountain] ,) and brought him to Yehu [Yehovah is He] : and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he [is] the son of Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] , who sought the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) with all his heart. So the house of Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] had no power to keep still the kingdom."
2 Chronicles,22,10,"But when ‘Atalyahu [afflicted of the Lord] the mother of Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
2 Chronicles,22,11,"But Y’hoshav’at [Yehovah is an oath] , the daughter of the king, took Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] the son of Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] , and stole him from among the king’s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Y’hoshav’at [Yehovah is an oath] , the daughter of king Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] , the wife of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] the priest, (for she was the sister of Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] ,) hid him from ‘Atalyahu [afflicted of the Lord] , so that she killed him not."
2 Chronicles,22,12,And he was with them hid in the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] six years: and ‘Atalyahu [afflicted of the Lord] reigned over the land.
2 Chronicles,23,1,"And in the seventh year Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] the son of Yerocham [showing pity] , and Yishma’el [God will hear] the son of Y’hochanan [Yehovah has graced] , and ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] the son of ‘Oved [serving] , and Ma’aseiyah [work of Yehovah] the son of ‘Adayah [Yehovah has adorned Himself] , and Elishafat [my God has judged] the son of Zikhri [Illustrious] , into covenant with him."
2 Chronicles,23,2,"And they went about in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and gathered the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] out of all the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and the chief of the fathers of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and they came to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Chronicles,23,3,"And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] . And he said unto them, Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has said of the sons of David [beloved]."
2 Chronicles,23,4,"This [is] the thing that you 2f shall do; A third part of you entering on the Shabbat [Rest] , of the priests and of the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to], [shall be] porters of the doors;"
2 Chronicles,23,5,And a third part [shall be] at the king’s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people [shall be] in the courts of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
2 Chronicles,23,6,"But let none come into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , save the priests, and they that minister of the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] ; they shall go in, for they [are] holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Chronicles,23,7,"And the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] shall compass (go around, encircle; encompass) the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever [else] comes into the house, he shall be put to death: but be you 2f with the king when he comes in, and when he goes out."
2 Chronicles,23,8,"So the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] and all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] did according to all things that Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the Shabbat [Rest] , with them that were to go [out] on the Shabbat [Rest] : for Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] the priest dismissed not the courses."
2 Chronicles,23,9,"Moreover Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that [had been] king David’s [beloved] ’s, which [were] in the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
2 Chronicles,23,10,"And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about."
2 Chronicles,23,11,"Then they brought out the king’s son, and put upon him the crown, and [gave him] the testimony, and made him king. And Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] and his sons anointed him, and said, Long live the king!"
2 Chronicles,23,12,"Now when ‘Atalyahu [afflicted of the Lord] heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):"
2 Chronicles,23,13,"And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of music, and such as taught to sing praise. Then ‘Atalyahu [afflicted of the Lord] rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason."
2 Chronicles,23,14,"Then Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso follows her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Chronicles,23,15,"So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king’s house, they killed her there."
2 Chronicles,23,16,"And Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] people."
2 Chronicles,23,17,"Then all the people went to the house of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , and broke it down, and broke his altars and his images in pieces, and killed Mattan [a gift] the priest of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] before the altars."
2 Chronicles,23,18,"Also Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] appointed the offices of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) by the hand of the priests the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , whom David [beloved] had distributed in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to offer the burnt offerings of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , as [it is] written in the law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , with rejoicing and with singing, [as it was ordained] by David [beloved]."

2 Chronicles,23,20,"And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and they came through the high gate into the king’s house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom."
2 Chronicles,23,21,"And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain ‘Atalyahu [afflicted of the Lord] with the sword."
2 Chronicles,24,1,"Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] [was] seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . His mother’s name also [was] Tzivyah [roe] of Be’er-sheva [Well of the sevenfold Oath]."
2 Chronicles,24,2,And Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] did [that which was] right in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) all the days of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] the priest.
2 Chronicles,24,3,And Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] took for him two wives; and he begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) sons and daughters.

2 Chronicles,24,5,"And he gathered together the priests and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and gather of all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] money to repair the house of your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] from year to year, and see that you 2f hasten the matter. However the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] hastened [it] not."
2 Chronicles,24,6,"And the king called for Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] the chief, and said unto him, Why have you i not required of the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] to bring in out of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and out of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] the collection, [according to the commandment] of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] the servant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and of the congregation of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , for the tabernacle of witness?"
2 Chronicles,24,7,"For the sons of ‘Atalyahu [afflicted of the Lord] , that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) did they bestow upon Ba’alim [lords (false gods)]."

2 Chronicles,24,10,"And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end."
2 Chronicles,24,11,"Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king’s office by the hand of the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , and when they saw that [there was] much money, the king’s scribe and the high priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance."
2 Chronicles,24,12,"And the king and Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Chronicles,24,13,"So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in his state, and strengthened it."
2 Chronicles,24,14,"And when they had finished [it] , they brought the rest of the money before the king and Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] , whereof were made vessels for the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [even] vessels to minister, and to offer [withal] , and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver.

2 Chronicles,24,17,"Now after the death of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] came the princes of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and made obesiance (bowing or kneeling in respect) to the king. Then the king listened unto them."
2 Chronicles,24,18,"And they left the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] for this their trespass."
2 Chronicles,24,19,"Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear."
2 Chronicles,24,20,"And the Spirit of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] came upon Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus says God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , Why transgress you 2f the commandments of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that you 2f cannot prosper? because you 2f have forsaken the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , he has also forsaken you."
2 Chronicles,24,21,"And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Chronicles,24,22,"Thus Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] the king remembered not the kindness which Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] his father had done to him, but killed his son. And when he died, he said, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) look upon [it] , and require [it]."
2 Chronicles,24,23,"And it came to pass at the end of the year, [that] the host of Aram [exalted] (Syria) [exalted] came up against him: and they came to Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) of them unto the king of Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver]."
2 Chronicles,24,24,"For the army of the Aram [exalted] [Syrians] came with a small company of men, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Yo’ash [Given by the Lord]."
2 Chronicles,24,25,"And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] the priest, and killed him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David [beloved] , but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings."
2 Chronicles,24,26,"And these are they that conspired against him; Zavad [he endows] the son of Shim’at [report] an ‘Amonit [tribal] , and Y’hozavad [Yehovah has endowed] the son of Shimrith a Moaviah [from father: what father?]."
2 Chronicles,24,27,"Now [concerning] his sons, and the greatness of the burdens [laid] upon him, and the repairing of the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , behold, they [are] written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] his son reigned in his stead."
2 Chronicles,25,1,"Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] [was] twenty and five years old [when] he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And his mother’s name [was] Y’ho’adan [Yehovah delights] of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."

2 Chronicles,25,3,"Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he killed his servants that had killed the king his father."
2 Chronicles,25,4,"But he killed not their children, but [did] as [it is] written in the law in the book of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , where the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin."
2 Chronicles,25,5,"Moreover Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] gathered Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of [their] fathers, throughout all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] : and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice [men, able] to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield."
2 Chronicles,25,6,He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] for an hundred talents of silver.
2 Chronicles,25,7,"But there came a man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] go with you i ; for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] not with Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [that is to say, with] all the children of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful]."
2 Chronicles,25,8,"But if you i will go, do [it] , be strong for the battle: God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shall make you i fall before the enemy: for God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The any Powered] has power to help, and to cast down."
2 Chronicles,25,9,"And Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] said to the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ? And the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] answered, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) is able to give you i much more than this."
2 Chronicles,25,10,"Then Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] separated them, [that is to say] , the army that was come to him out of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and they returned home in great anger."
2 Chronicles,25,11,"And Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and struck of the children of Se’ir [Shaggy] ten thousand."
2 Chronicles,25,12,"And [other] ten thousand [left] alive did the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces."
2 Chronicles,25,13,"But the soldiers of the army which Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , from Shomron [watch mountain] even unto Beit-Horon [House of Hollowness] , and struck three thousand of them, and took much spoil (plunder; prey; booty)."
2 Chronicles,25,14,"Now it came to pass, after that Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] was come from the slaughter of the Edomi [red] , that he brought the gods of the children of Se’ir [Shaggy] , and set them up [to be] his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them."
2 Chronicles,25,15,"For what reason the anger of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was kindled against Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] , and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why have you i sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of you i hand?"
2 Chronicles,25,16,"And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that [the king] said unto him, Are you i made of the king’s counsel? refrain (restrain; refrein from acting) ; why should you i be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has determined to destroy you i , because you i have done this, and have not listened unto my counsel."
2 Chronicles,25,17,"Then Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] took advice, and sent to Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] , the son of Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] , the son of Yehu [Yehovah is He] , king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, Come, let us see one another in the face."
2 Chronicles,25,18,"And Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] sent to Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , saying, The thistle that [was] in L’vanon [Whiteness] sent to the cedar that [was] in L’vanon [Whiteness] , saying, Give you i daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that [was] in L’vanon [Whiteness] , and trampled down the thistle."
2 Chronicles,25,19,"you i say, Lo, you i have smitten the Edomi [red] ; and you i heart lifts you i up to boast: abide now at home; why should you i meddle to [you i ] hurt, that you i should fall, [even] you i , and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] with you i?"
2 Chronicles,25,20,"But Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] would not hear; for it [came] of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , that he might deliver them into the hand [of their enemies] , because they sought after the gods of Edom [Red]."
2 Chronicles,25,21,"So Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went up; and they saw one another in the face, [both] he and Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , at Beit-Shemesh [House of the Sun] , which [belongs] to Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."

2 Chronicles,25,24,"And [he took] all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] with ‘Oved-Edom [servant of Edom] , and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Shomron [watch mountain]."
2 Chronicles,25,25,And Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] the son of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] lived after the death of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] son of Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] fifteen years.
2 Chronicles,25,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] , first and last, behold, [are] they not written in the book of the kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
2 Chronicles,25,27,"Now after the time that Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] did turn away from following the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) they made a conspiracy against him in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; and he fled to Lakhish [Invincible] : but they sent to Lakhish [Invincible] after him, and killed him there."

2 Chronicles,26,4,"And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , according to all that his father Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] did."
2 Chronicles,26,5,"And he sought God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in the days of Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers] , who had understanding in the visions of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : and as long as he sought the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] made him to prosper."
2 Chronicles,26,6,"And he went forth and warred against the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and broke down the wall of Gat [Winepress] , and the wall of Yavneh [building of God] , and the wall of Ashdod [powerful] , and built cities about Ashdod [powerful] , and among the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."
2 Chronicles,26,7,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] helped him against the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-Ba’al [dwelling of lord] , and the Me’unim [habitations]."
2 Chronicles,26,8,And the ‘Amon [Inbred] gave gifts to ‘Uziyah [my strength is Yehovah] : and his name spread abroad [even] to the entering in of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ; for he strengthened [himself] exceedingly.
2 Chronicles,26,9,"Moreover ‘Uziyah [my strength is Yehovah] built towers in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning [of the wall] , and fortified them."
2 Chronicles,26,10,"Also he built towers in the desert, and excavated many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen [also] , and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel [Garden-land] : for he loved husbandry."
2 Chronicles,26,11,"Moreover ‘Uziyah [my strength is Yehovah] had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Ye’i’el [God sweeps away] the scribe and Ma’aseiyah [work of Yehovah] the ruler, under the hand of Hananyah [God has favoured], [one] of the king’s captains."

2 Chronicles,26,15,"And he made in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong."
2 Chronicles,26,16,"But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to [his] destruction: for he transgressed against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and went into the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to burn incense upon the altar of incense."
2 Chronicles,26,17,"And ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [that were] valiant men:"
2 Chronicles,26,18,"And they withstood ‘Uziyah [my strength is Yehovah] the king, and said unto him, [It pertains] not unto you i , ‘Uziyah [my strength is Yehovah] , to burn incense unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , but to the priests the sons of Aharon [Bright, Very High] , that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for you i have trespassed; neither [shall it be] for you i honour from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
2 Chronicles,26,19,"Then ‘Uziyah [my strength is Yehovah] was exceedingly angry, and [had] a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was exceedingly angry with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , from beside the incense altar."
2 Chronicles,26,20,"And ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he [was] leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from there; yes, himself hasted also to go out, because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had smitten him."
2 Chronicles,26,21,"And ‘Uziyah [my strength is Yehovah] the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, [being] a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] his son [was] over the king’s house, judging the people of the land."
2 Chronicles,26,22,"Now the rest of the acts of ‘Uziyah [my strength is Yehovah] , first and last, did Yesha’yahu [Yehovah has saved] the prophet, the son of Amotz [strong] , write."
2 Chronicles,26,23,"So ‘Uziyah [my strength is Yehovah] slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which [belonged] to the kings; for they said, He [is] a leper: and Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] his son reigned in his stead."
2 Chronicles,27,1,"Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] [was] twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . His mother’s name also [was] Yerushah [dispossessor] , the daughter of Tzadok [righteous]."
2 Chronicles,27,2,"And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , according to all that his father ‘Uziyah [my strength is Yehovah] did: howbeit he entered not into the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . And the people did yet corruptly."
2 Chronicles,27,3,"He built the high gate of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and on the wall of ‘Ofel [hill] he built much."
2 Chronicles,27,4,"Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and in the forests he built castles and towers."
2 Chronicles,27,5,"He fought also with the king of the ‘Amon [Inbred] , and prevailed against them. And the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] pay unto him, both the second year, and the third."
2 Chronicles,27,6,"So Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
2 Chronicles,27,7,"Now the rest of the acts of Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] , and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they [are] written in the book of the kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."

2 Chronicles,27,9,"And Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David [beloved] : and Achaz [he has grasped] his son reigned in his stead."
2 Chronicles,28,1,"Achaz [he has grasped] [was] twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : but he did not [that which was] right in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , like David [beloved] his father:"
2 Chronicles,28,2,"For he walked in the ways of the kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and made also molten images for Ba’alim [lords (false gods)]."
2 Chronicles,28,3,"Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom [Lamentation] , and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had cast out before the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,28,4,"He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree."
2 Chronicles,28,5,"For what reason the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] delivered him into the hand of the king of Aram [exalted] (Syria) [exalted] ; and they struck him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought [them] to Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] . And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , who struck him with a great slaughter."
2 Chronicles,28,6,"For Pekach [opened] the son of Remalyahu [protected by Yehovah] killed in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, [which were] all valiant men; because they had forsaken the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,28,7,"And Zikhri [Illustrious] , a mighty man of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , killed Ma’aseiyah [work of Yehovah] the king’s son, and ‘Azrikam [help against the enemy] the governor of the house, and Elkanah [God Has Taken Possession] [that was] next to the king."
2 Chronicles,28,8,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil (plunder; prey; booty) from them, and brought the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) to Shomron [watch mountain]."
2 Chronicles,28,9,"But a prophet of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was there, whose name [was] ‘Oded [restorer] : and he went out before the host that came to Shomron [watch mountain] , and said unto them, Behold, because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of your fathers was exceedingly angry with Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , he has delivered them into your hand, and you 2f have slain them in a rage [that] reaches up unto heaven."
2 Chronicles,28,10,"And now you 2f purpose to keep under the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: [but are there] not with you, even with you, sins against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]?"
2 Chronicles,28,11,"Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which you 2f have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] upon you."
2 Chronicles,28,12,"Then certain of the heads of the children of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] the son of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , Berekhyah [Yehovah blesses] the son of Meshillemot [recompense] , and Y’chizkiyah [Yehovah has made me strong] the son of Shalum [retribution] , and ‘Amasa [burden] the son of Hadlai [rest of God] , stood up against them that came from the war,"
2 Chronicles,28,13,"And said unto them, You 2f shall not bring in the captives here: for whereas we have offended against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [already] , you 2f intend to add [more] to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and [there is] fierce wrath against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,28,14,So the armed men left the captives and the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) before the princes and all the congregation.
2 Chronicles,28,15,"And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Yericho [Its Moon] , the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Shomron [watch mountain]."
2 Chronicles,28,16,"At that time did king Achaz [he has grasped] send unto the kings of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem [name] (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) to help him."
2 Chronicles,28,17,"For again the Edomi [red] had come and smitten Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and carried away captives."
2 Chronicles,28,18,"The P’lishtim [Immigrants] also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and had taken Beit-Shemesh [House of the Sun] , and Ayalon [Field of Deer] , and G’derot [Walls] , and Sokho [bushy] with the villages thereof, and Timnah [Portion] with the villages thereof, Gimzo [fertile sycamores] also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there."
2 Chronicles,28,19,"For the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) brought Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] low because of Achaz [he has grasped] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; for he made Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] naked, and transgressed sore against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Chronicles,28,20,"And Tigat-Piln’eser [you will uncover the wonderful bond] king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem [name] (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not."
2 Chronicles,28,21,"For Achaz [he has grasped] took away a portion [out] of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and [out] of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave [it] unto the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem [name] (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) : but he helped him not."
2 Chronicles,28,22,And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : this [is that] king Achaz [he has grasped].
2 Chronicles,28,23,"For he sacrificed unto the gods of Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] , which struck him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Aram [exalted] (Syria) [exalted] help them, [therefore] will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,28,24,"And Achaz [he has grasped] gathered together the vessels of the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and shut up the doors of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and he made him altars in every corner of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Chronicles,28,25,"And in every single (each one separately) city of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of his fathers."
2 Chronicles,28,26,"Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they [are] written in the book of the kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,28,27,"And Achaz [he has grasped] slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, [even] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] his son reigned in his stead."
2 Chronicles,29,1,"Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] began to reign [when he was] five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And his mother’s name [was] Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father] , the daughter of Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers]."

2 Chronicles,29,6,"For our fathers have trespassed, and done [that which was] evil in the eyes of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and turned [their] backs."
2 Chronicles,29,7,"Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy [place] unto the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,29,8,"For what reason the wrath of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was upon Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and he has delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as you 2f see with your eyes."

2 Chronicles,29,22,"So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled [it] on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar."
2 Chronicles,29,23,And they brought forth the he goats [for] the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:
2 Chronicles,29,24,"And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : for the king commanded [that] the burnt offering and the sin offering [should be made] for all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,29,25,"And he set the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David [beloved] , and of Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] the king’s seer, and Natan [giver] the prophet: for [so was] the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) by his prophets."
2 Chronicles,29,26,"And the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] stood with the instruments of David [beloved] , and the priests with the trumpets."
2 Chronicles,29,27,"And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) began [also] with the trumpets, and with the instruments [ordained] by David [beloved] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,29,28,"And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: [and] all [this continued] until the burnt offering was finished."
2 Chronicles,29,29,"And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped."
2 Chronicles,29,30,"Moreover Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] the king and the princes commanded the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] to sing praise unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) with the words of David [beloved] , and of Asaf [gatherer] the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped."
2 Chronicles,29,31,"Then Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] answered and said, Now you 2f have consecrated yourselves unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings."
2 Chronicles,29,32,"And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, [and] two hundred lambs: all these [were] for a burnt offering to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Chronicles,29,33,And the consecrated things [were] six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
2 Chronicles,29,34,"But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay (stip the skin off) all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] did help them, till the work was ended, and until the [other] priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] [were] more upright in heart to sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) themselves than the priests."
2 Chronicles,29,35,"And also the burnt offerings [were] in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for [every] burnt offering. So the service of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was set in order."
2 Chronicles,29,36,"And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] rejoiced, and all the people, that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had prepared the people: for the thing was [done] suddenly."
2 Chronicles,30,1,"And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] sent to all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and wrote letters also to Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] and M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , that they should come to the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , to keep the Passover unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,30,2,"For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , to keep the Passover in the second month."
2 Chronicles,30,3,"For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Chronicles,30,4,And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
2 Chronicles,30,5,"So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , from Be’er-sheva [Well of the sevenfold Oath] even to Dan [Judge] , that they should come to keep the Passover unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : for they had not done [it] of a long [time in such sort] as it was written."
2 Chronicles,30,6,"So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and according to the commandment of the king, saying, You 2f people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , turn again unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Avraham [Exalted Father] , Yitz’khak [Laughter] , and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem [name] (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known)))."
2 Chronicles,30,7,"And be not you 2f like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of their fathers, [who] therefore gave them up to desolation, as you 2f see."
2 Chronicles,30,8,"Now be you 2f not stiffnecked, as your fathers [were, but] yield yourselves unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever: and serve the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you."
2 Chronicles,30,9,"For if you 2f turn again unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , your brethren and your children [shall find] compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is] gracious and merciful, and will not turn away [his] face from you, if you 2f return unto him."
2 Chronicles,30,10,"So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] and M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] even unto Z’vulun [Glorious Dwelling Place] : but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them."
2 Chronicles,30,11,"Nevertheless diverse of Asher [Happy] and M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] and of Z’vulun [Glorious Dwelling Place] humbled themselves, and came to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Chronicles,30,12,"Also in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] the hand of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Chronicles,30,13,"And there assembled at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation."
2 Chronicles,30,14,"And they arose and took away the altars that [were] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast [them] into the brook Kidron [dark]."
2 Chronicles,30,15,"Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth [day] of the second month: and the priests and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Chronicles,30,16,"And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : the priests sprinkled the blood, [which they received] of the hand of the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to]."
2 Chronicles,30,17,"For [there were] many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one [that was] not clean, to sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) [them] unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Chronicles,30,18,"For a multitude of the people, [even] many of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , and M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , Yissakhar [There Is Recompense] , and Z’vulun [Glorious Dwelling Place] , had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the Passover otherwise than it was written. But Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] prayed for them, saying, The good Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) pardon every one"
2 Chronicles,30,19," [That] prepares his heart to seek God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of his fathers, though [he be] not [cleansed] according to the purification of the sanctuary."
2 Chronicles,30,20,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) listened to Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] , and healed the people."
2 Chronicles,30,21,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that were present at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] and the priests praised the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) day by day, [singing] with loud instruments unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Chronicles,30,22,"And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] spoke comfortably unto all the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] that taught the good knowledge of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of their fathers."
2 Chronicles,30,23,And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept [other] seven days with gladness.
2 Chronicles,30,24,For Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
2 Chronicles,30,25,"And all the congregation of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , with the priests and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , and all the congregation that came out of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and the strangers that came out of the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and that dwelt in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , rejoiced."
2 Chronicles,30,26,So there was great joy in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : for since the time of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] the son of David [beloved] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [there was] not the like in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace].
2 Chronicles,30,27,"Then the priests the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] arose and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came [up] to his holy dwelling place, [even] unto heaven."
2 Chronicles,31,1,"Now when all this was finished, all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that were present went out to the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and broke the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , in Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] also and M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities."
2 Chronicles,31,2,"And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] appointed the courses of the priests and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Chronicles,31,3," [He appointed] also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, [that is to say] , for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the Shabbat, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as [it is] written in the law of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Chronicles,31,4,"Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to give the portion of the priests and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , that they might be encouraged in the law of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Chronicles,31,5,"And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all [things] brought they in abundantly."
2 Chronicles,31,6,"And [concerning] the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , that dwelt in the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and laid [them] by heaps."
2 Chronicles,31,7,"In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished [them] in the seventh month."
2 Chronicles,31,8,"And when Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] and the princes came and saw the heaps, they Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and his people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,31,9,Then Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] questioned with the priests and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] concerning the heaps.
2 Chronicles,31,10,"And ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] the chief priest of the house of Tzadok [righteous] answered him, and said, Since [the people] began to bring the offerings into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) his people; and that which is left [is] this great store."
2 Chronicles,31,11,"Then Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and they prepared [them],"
2 Chronicles,31,12,"And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated [things] faithfully: over which Konanyahu [Yehovah has established] the Levi (Levite) [Joined to] [was] ruler, and Shime’i [Fame] his brother [was] the next."
2 Chronicles,31,13,"And Jehiel, and ‘Azazyahu [Yehovah is mighty] , and Nachat [rest] , and ‘Asah’el [God-made] , and Yerimot [He is Most High] , and Yozavad [Yehovah has endowed] , and Eli’el [my God is God] , and Yishmachyah [Yehovah sustains] , and Machat [grasping] , and B’nayahu [Yehovah has built], [were] overseers under the hand of Konanyahu [Yehovah has established] and Shime’i [Fame] his brother, at the commandment of Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] the king, and ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] the ruler of the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
2 Chronicles,31,14,"And Kore [crier] the son of Yimnah [right hand] the Levi (Levite) [Joined to] , the porter toward the east, [was] over the freewill offerings of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , to distribute the oblations of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the most holy things."
2 Chronicles,31,15,"And next him [were] ‘Eden [pleasure] , and Minyamin [from the right hand] , and Yeshua [he is saved] , and Sh’may’yah [Yehovah hears] , Amaryah [Yehovah speaks] , and Sh’khanyahu [dweller with Yehovah] , in the cities of the priests, in [their] set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:"

2 Chronicles,31,20,"And thus did Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] throughout all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and wrought [that which was] good and right and tbefore the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
2 Chronicles,31,21,"And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , he did [it] with all his heart, and prospered."
2 Chronicles,32,1,"After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sancheriv [Sin (the moon) multiplied brothers] king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem [name] (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) came, and entered into Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself."
2 Chronicles,32,2,"And when Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] saw that Sancheriv [Sin (the moon) multiplied brothers] was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace],"
2 Chronicles,32,3,He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which [were] without the city: and they did help him.
2 Chronicles,32,4,"So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem [name] (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) come, and find much water?"
2 Chronicles,32,5,"Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised [it] up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo [fortification (defensive structure) or mound] [in] the city of David [beloved] , and made darts and shields in abundance."
2 Chronicles,32,6,"And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spoke comfortably to them, saying,"
2 Chronicles,32,7,"Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem [name] (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , nor for all the multitude that [is] with him: for [there be] more with us than with him:"

And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
2 Chronicles,32,9,"After this did Sancheriv [Sin (the moon) multiplied brothers] king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem [name] (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) send his servants to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace], (but he [himself laid siege] against Lakhish [Invincible], and all his power with him,) unto Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and unto all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] that [were] at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , saying,"
2 Chronicles,32,10,"Thus says Sancheriv [Sin (the moon) multiplied brothers] king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem [name] (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , Whereon do you 2f trust, that you 2f abide in the siege in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]?"
2 Chronicles,32,11,"Does not Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem [name] (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known)))?"
2 Chronicles,32,12,"Has not the same Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , saying, You 2f shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?"
2 Chronicles,32,13,Know you 2f not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of [other] lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of my hand?
2 Chronicles,32,14,"Who [was there] among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] should be able to deliver you out of my hand?"
2 Chronicles,32,15,"Now therefore let not Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] deliver you out of my hand?"
2 Chronicles,32,16,"And his servants spoke yet [more] against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and against his servant Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength]."

2 Chronicles,32,18,"Then they cried with a loud voice in the Y’hudit (Y’hudim (Judeans)’) speech unto the people of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] that [were] on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city."
2 Chronicles,32,19,"And they spoke against the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , as against the gods of the people of the earth, [which were] the work of the hands of man."

2 Chronicles,32,21,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem [name] (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) . So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels (inward parts; affections) killed him there with the sword."
2 Chronicles,32,22,"Thus the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) saved Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] from the hand of Sancheriv [Sin (the moon) multiplied brothers] the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem [name] (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , and from the hand of all [other] , and guided them on every side."
2 Chronicles,32,23,"And many brought gifts unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and presents to Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] : so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth."
2 Chronicles,32,24,"In those days Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] was sick to the death, and prayed unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and he spoke unto him, and he gave him a sign."
2 Chronicles,32,25,"But Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] rendered not again according to the benefit [done] unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Chronicles,32,26,"Yet Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] humbled himself for the pride of his heart, [both] he and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , so that the wrath of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came not upon them in the days of Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength]."
2 Chronicles,32,27,"And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;"

2 Chronicles,32,30,"This same Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] also stopped the upper watercourse of Gikhon (Bursting Forth) , and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David [beloved] . And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] prospered in all his works."
2 Chronicles,32,31,"However in [the business of] the ambassadors of the princes of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was [done] in the land, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] left him, to try him, that he might know all [that was] in his heart."
2 Chronicles,32,32,"Now the rest of the acts of Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] , and his goodness, behold, they [are] written in the vision of Yesha’yahu [Yehovah has saved] the prophet, the son of Amotz [strong], [and] in the book of the kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,32,33,"And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the most important of the sepulchres of the sons of David [beloved] : and all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] did him honour at his death. And M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] his son reigned in his stead."
2 Chronicles,33,1,"M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] [was] twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]:"
2 Chronicles,33,2,"But did [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had cast out before the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,33,3,"For he built again the high places which Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Ba’alim [lords (false gods)] , and made groves, and worshipped all the army of heaven, and served them."
2 Chronicles,33,4,"Also he built altars in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , whereof the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had said, In Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] shall my name be forever."

2 Chronicles,33,6,"And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom [Lamentation] : also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to provoke him to anger."
2 Chronicles,33,7,"And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , of which God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had said to David [beloved] and to Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] his son, In this house, and in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , which I have chosen before all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , will I put my name forever:"
2 Chronicles,33,8,"Neither will I any more remove the foot of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
2 Chronicles,33,9,"So M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] made Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to err, [and] to do worse than the heathen, whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had destroyed before the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Chronicles,33,10,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke to M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , and to his people: but they would not hearken."
2 Chronicles,33,11,"For what reason the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem [name] (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , which took M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
2 Chronicles,33,12,"And when he was in affliction, he besought the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and humbled himself greatly before the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of his fathers,"
2 Chronicles,33,13,"And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] into his kingdom. Then M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] knew that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) he [was] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
2 Chronicles,33,14,"Now after this he built a wall without the city of David [beloved] , on the west side of Gikhon (Bursting Forth) , in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about ‘Ofel [hill] , and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
2 Chronicles,33,15,"And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and cast [them] out of the city."
2 Chronicles,33,16,"And he repaired the altar of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] to serve the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."

2 Chronicles,33,22,"But he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , as did M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] his father: for ‘Amon [master workman] sacrificed unto all the carved images which M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] his father had made, and served them;"
2 Chronicles,33,23,"And humbled not himself before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , as M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] his father had humbled himself; but ‘Amon [master workman] trespassed more and more."
2 Chronicles,33,24,"And his servants conspired against him, and killed him in his own house."
2 Chronicles,33,25,But the people of the land killed all them that had conspired against king ‘Amon [master workman] ; and the people of the land made Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] his son king in his stead.

2 Chronicles,34,3,"For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of David [beloved] his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images."
2 Chronicles,34,4,"And they broke down the altars of Ba’alim [lords (false gods)] in his presence; and the images, that [were] on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust [of them] , and strewed [it] upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them."
2 Chronicles,34,5,"And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
