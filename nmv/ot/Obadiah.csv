Obadiah,1,1,"The vision of ‘Ovadyah [servant of Yehovah] . Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) concerning Edom [Red] ; We have heard a rumour from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise you 2f , and let us rise up against her in battle."
Obadiah,1,2,"Behold, I have made you i small among the heathen: you i are greatly despised."
Obadiah,1,3,"The pride of your i heart has deceived you i , you i that dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation [is] high; that says in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?"
Obadiah,1,4,"Though you i exalt [yourself] as the eagle, and though you i set your i nest among the stars, there will I bring you i down, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Obadiah,1,5,"If thieves came to you i , if robbers by night, (how are you i cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to you i , would they not leave [some] grapes?"
Obadiah,1,6,How are [the things] of ‘Esav [Hairy] searched out! [how] are his hidden things sought up!
Obadiah,1,7,"All the men of your i alliance have brought you i [even] to the border: the men that were at peace with you i have deceived you i, [and] prevailed against you i; [they that eat] your i bread have laid a wound under you i: [there is] none understanding in him."
Obadiah,1,8,"Shall I not in that day, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , even destroy the wise [men] out of Edom [Red] , and understanding out of the mount of ‘Esav [Hairy]?"
Obadiah,1,9,"And your i mighty [men] , O Teman [south] , shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of ‘Esav [Hairy] may be cut off by slaughter."
Obadiah,1,10,"For [your i ] violence against you i brother Ya’akov [Heal of God] shame shall cover you i , and you i shall be cut off forever."
Obadiah,1,11,"In the day that you i stood on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , even you i [were] as one of them."
Obadiah,1,12,But you i should not have looked on the day of your i brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither should you i have rejoiced over the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] in the day of their destruction; neither should you i have spoken proudly in the day of distress.
Obadiah,1,13,"you i should not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yes, you i should not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid [hands] on their substance in the day of their calamity;"
Obadiah,1,14,"Neither should you i have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither should you i have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress."
Obadiah,1,15,"For the day of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] near upon all the heathen: as you i have done, it shall be done unto you i : your i reward shall return upon your i own head."
Obadiah,1,16,"For as you 2f have drunk upon my holy mountain, [so] shall all the heathen drink continually, yes, they shall drink, and they shall swallow (to approve, commend, accept) down, and they shall be as though they had not been."
Obadiah,1,17,"But upon mount Tziyon [parched place] shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Ya’akov [Heal of God] shall possess their possessions."
Obadiah,1,18,"And the house of Ya’akov [Heal of God] shall be a fire, and the house of Yosef [(God) He Shall Add] a flame, and the house of ‘Esav [Hairy] for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be [any] remaining of the house of ‘Esav [Hairy] ; for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has spoken [it]."
Obadiah,1,19,"And [they of] the south shall possess the mount of ‘Esav [Hairy] ; and [they of] the plain the P’lishtim [Immigrants] : and they shall possess the fields of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , and the fields of Shomron [watch mountain] : and Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] [shall possess] Gil’ad [Rocky Region]."
Obadiah,1,20,"And the captivity of this host of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [shall possess] that of the Kena’ani [Merchant], [even] unto Tzarfat [refinery] ; and the captivity of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , which [is] in S’farad [separated] , shall possess the cities of the south."
Obadiah,1,21,And saviours shall come up on mount Tziyon [parched place] to judge the mount of ‘Esav [Hairy] ; and the kingdom shall be the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate].
