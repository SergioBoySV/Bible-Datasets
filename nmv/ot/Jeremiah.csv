Jeremiah,6,10,"To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear [is] uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) is unto them a reproach (disgrace; shame) ; they have no delight in it."
Jeremiah,6,11,"Therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with [him that is] full of days."

Jeremiah,7,2,"Stand in the gate of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , all [you 2f of] Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , that enter in at these gates to worship the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,7,3,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place."

Jeremiah,7,18,"The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead [their] dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger."
Jeremiah,7,19,Do they provoke me to anger? says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate): [do they] not [provoke] themselves to the confusion of their own faces?
Jeremiah,7,20,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, my anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched."

Jeremiah,7,22,"For I spoke not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:"
Jeremiah,7,23,"But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and you 2f shall be my people: and walk you 2f in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you."
Jeremiah,7,24,"But they listened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels [and] in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward."
Jeremiah,7,25,"Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending [them]:"
Jeremiah,7,26,"Yet they listened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers."
Jeremiah,7,27,Therefore you i shall speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to you i : you i shall also call unto them; but they will not answer you i.
Jeremiah,7,28,"But you i shall say unto them, This [is] a nation that obeys not the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , nor receives correction: tis perished, and is cut off from their mouth."
Jeremiah,7,29,"Cut off you i hair, [O Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]] , and cast [it] away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath."
Jeremiah,7,30,"For the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] have done evil in my sight, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it."
Jeremiah,7,31,"And they have built the high places of Tofet [place of fire] , which [is] in the valley of the son of Hinnom [Lamentation] , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded [them] not, neither came it into my heart."
Jeremiah,7,32,"Therefore, behold, the days come, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that it shall no more be called Tofet [place of fire] , nor the valley of the son of Hinnom [Lamentation] , but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tofet [place of fire] , till there be no place."
Jeremiah,7,33,"And the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall frighten (make afriad) [them] away."

Jeremiah,8,1,"At that time, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , out of their graves:"
Jeremiah,8,2,"And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the army of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth."
Jeremiah,8,3,"And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue (part that remains, the rest) of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places to which I have driven them, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."

Jeremiah,8,6,"I listened and heard, [but] they spoke not aright (in the right way) : no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? everyone turned to his course, as the horse rushes into the battle."
Jeremiah,8,7,"Yes, the stork in the heaven knows her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow (to approve, commend, accept) observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,8,8,"How do you 2f say, We [are] wise, and the law of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he [it] ; the pen of the scribes [is] in vain."
Jeremiah,8,9,"The wise [men] are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and what wisdom [is] in them?"
Jeremiah,8,10,"Therefore will I give their wives unto others, [and] their fields to them that shall inherit [them] : for everyone from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest everyone deals falsely."
Jeremiah,8,11,"For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when [there is] no peace."
Jeremiah,8,12,"Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,8,13,"I will surely consume them, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate): [there shall be] no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and [the things that] I have given them shall pass away from them."
Jeremiah,8,14,"Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has put us to silence, and given us water of gall (something bitter or poisonous) to (to do entirely, do wholly) drink, because we have sinned against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."

[is] not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, [and] with strange vanities?"
Jeremiah,8,20,"The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved."
Jeremiah,8,21,For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment has taken hold on me.
Jeremiah,8,22, [Is there] no balm (a medicine; rosin from a bush) in Gil’ad [Rocky Region]; [is there] no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?

Jeremiah,9,9,Shall I not visit them for these [things] ? says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
Jeremiah,9,10,"For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through [them] ; neither can [men] hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone."
Jeremiah,9,11,"And I will make Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] heaps, [and] a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] desolate, without an inhabitant."

Jeremiah,9,18,"And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters."

Jeremiah,10,8,But they are altogether cruel and foolish: the stock [is] a doctrine of vanities.
Jeremiah,10,9,"Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish [yellow jasper] , and gold from Ufaz [desire of fine gold] , the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple [is] their clothing: they [are] all the work of cunning [men]."
Jeremiah,10,10,"But the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] the true God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , he [is] the living God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation."

Jeremiah,20,7,"O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , you i have deceived me, and I was deceived: you i are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am in ridicule (laughing at enemies’ threats) daily, everyone mocks me."
Jeremiah,20,8,"For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil (plunder; prey; booty) ; because the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was made a reproach (disgrace; shame) unto me, and a ridicule (laughing at enemies’ threats), daily."

Jeremiah,21,2,"Enquire, I pray you i , of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) for us; for N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] makes war against us; if so be that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us."
Jeremiah,21,3,"Then said Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] unto them, Thus shall you 2f say to Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous]:"
Jeremiah,21,4,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that [are] in your hands, which you 2f fight against the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and [against] the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city."

Jeremiah,22,14,"That says, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cuts him out windows; and [it’s] cieling with cedar, and painted with vermilion."
Jeremiah,22,15,"Shalt you i reign, because you i clothe [yourself] in cedar? did not your i father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, [and] then [it was] well with him?"
Jeremiah,22,16,He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then [it was] well [with him: was] not this to know me? says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
Jeremiah,22,17,"But your i eyes and your i heart [are] not but for your i covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do [it]."

Jeremiah,22,24," [As] I live, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , though Koniyahu [Yehovah will establish] the son of Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] were the signet (seal or stamp) upon my right hand, yet would I pluck you i there;"
Jeremiah,22,25,"And I will give you i into the hand of them that seek your i life, and into the hand [of them] whose face you i fear, even into the hand of N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and into the hand of the Kasdim [clod-breakers]."

Jeremiah,22,28," [Is] this man Koniyahu [Yehovah will establish] a despised broken idol? [is he] a vessel wherein [is] no pleasure? therefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?"
Jeremiah,22,29,"O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,22,30,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Write you 2f this man childless, a man [that] shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David [beloved] , and ruling any more in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
Jeremiah,23,1,Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).

Jeremiah,23,7,"Therefore, behold, the days come, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that they shall no more say, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, which brought up the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place];"
Jeremiah,23,8,"But, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of the north country, and from all countries to which I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land."
Jeremiah,23,9,"Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and because of the words of his holiness."

Jeremiah,23,13,"And I have seen folly in the prophets of Shomron [watch mountain] ; they prophesied in Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , and caused my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to err."
Jeremiah,23,14,"I have seen also in the prophets of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none does return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as S’dom [Burning] , and the inhabitants thereof as ‘Amora [Submersion]."
Jeremiah,23,15,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall (something bitter or poisonous) : for from the prophets of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] is profaneness gone forth into all the land."
Jeremiah,23,16,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , Listen not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, [and] not out of the mouth of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,23,17,"They say still unto them that despise me, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has said, You 2f shall have peace; and they say unto everyone that walks after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you."

Jeremiah,23,33,"And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you i , saying, What [is] the burden of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ? you i shall then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,23,34,"And [as for] the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , I will even punish that man and his house."
Jeremiah,23,35,"Thus shall you 2f say everyone to his neighbour, and everyone to his brother, What has the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) answered? and, What has the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoken?"
Jeremiah,23,36,"And the burden of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall you 2f mention no more: for every man’s word shall be his burden; for you 2f have perverted the words of El Chai [The Living God] , of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Jeremiah,23,37,"Thus shall you i say to the prophet, What has the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) answered you i ? and, What has the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoken?"
Jeremiah,23,38,"But since you 2f say, The burden of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; therefore thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; Because you 2f say this word, The burden of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and I have sent unto you, saying, You 2f shall not say, The burden of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate);"
Jeremiah,23,39,"Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, [and cast you] out of my presence:"
Jeremiah,23,40,"And I will bring an everlasting reproach (disgrace; shame) upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten."
Jeremiah,24,1,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs [were] set before the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , after that N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] had carried away captive Y’khanyahu [Yehovah will establish] the son of Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and the princes of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , with the carpenters and smiths, from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and had brought them to Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Jeremiah,24,2,"One basket [had] very good figs, [even] like the figs [that are] first ripe: and the other basket [had] very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad."
Jeremiah,24,3,"Then said the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto me, What see you i , Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] ? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil."
Jeremiah,24,4,"Again the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Jeremiah,24,5,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] for [their] good."
Jeremiah,24,6,"For I will set my eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull [them] down; and I will plant them, and not pluck [them] up."
Jeremiah,24,7,"And I will give them an heart to know me, that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and they shall be my people, and I will be their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : for they shall return unto me with their whole heart."
Jeremiah,24,8,"And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , So will I give Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] the king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and his princes, and the residue (part that remains, the rest) of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]:"
Jeremiah,24,9,"And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for [their] hurt, [to be] a reproach (disgrace; shame) and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places to which I shall drive them."
Jeremiah,24,10,"And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers."
Jeremiah,25,1,"The word that came to Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] concerning all the people of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] in the fourth year of Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] the son of Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , that [was] the first year of N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion];"
Jeremiah,25,2,"The which Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] the prophet spoke unto all the people of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and to all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , saying,"
Jeremiah,25,3,"From the thirteenth year of Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] the son of ‘Amon [master workman] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , even unto this day, that [is] the three and twentieth year, the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but you 2f have not listened."
Jeremiah,25,4,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending [them] ; but you 2f have not listened, nor inclined your ear to hear."
Jeremiah,25,5,"They said, Turn you 2f again now everyone from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has given unto you and to your fathers forever and ever:"
Jeremiah,25,6,"And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt."
Jeremiah,25,7,"Yet you 2f have not listened unto me, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; that you 2f might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt."
Jeremiah,25,8,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; Because you 2f have not heard my words,"
Jeremiah,25,9,"Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations."
Jeremiah,25,10,"Moreover I will take from them the voice of gladness, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle."
Jeremiah,25,11,"And this whole land shall be a desolation, [and] an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] seventy years."
Jeremiah,25,12,"And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, [that] I will punish the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and that nation, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , for their iniquity, and the land of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , and will make it perpetual desolations."
Jeremiah,25,13,"And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, [even] all that is written in this book, which Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] has prophesied against all the nations."
Jeremiah,25,14,"For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands."
Jeremiah,25,15,"For thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you i , to drink it."
Jeremiah,25,16,"And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them."
Jeremiah,25,17,"Then took I the cup at the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had sent me:"
Jeremiah,25,18," [To wit] , Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as [it is] this day;"

Jeremiah,25,27,"Therefore you i shall say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; Drink you 2f , and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you."
Jeremiah,25,28,"And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at your i hand to drink, then shall you i say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; You 2f shall certainly drink."
Jeremiah,25,29,"For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should you 2f be utterly unpunished? You 2f shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Jeremiah,25,30,"Therefore prophesy you i against them all these words, and say unto them, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that trample [the grapes] , against all the inhabitants of the earth."
Jeremiah,25,31,"A noise shall come [even] to the ends of the earth; for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them [that are] wicked to the sword, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,25,32,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth."
Jeremiah,25,33,"And the slain of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall be at that day from [one] end of the earth even unto the [other] end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground."
Jeremiah,25,34,"Howl, you 2f shepherds, and cry; and wallow (to approve, commend, accept) yourselves [in the ashes] , you 2f principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and you 2f shall fall like a prized vase."
Jeremiah,25,35,"And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape."
Jeremiah,25,36,"A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, [shall be heard] : for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has spoiled their pasture."
Jeremiah,25,37,And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
Jeremiah,25,38,"He has forsaken his colonnade, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger."
Jeremiah,26,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] the son of Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] came this word from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying,"
Jeremiah,26,2,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; Stand in the court of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] house, and speak unto all the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , which come to worship in the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] house, all the words that I command you i to speak unto them; diminish not a word:"

Jeremiah,26,4,"And you i shall say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; If you 2f will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,"
Jeremiah,26,5,"To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending [them] , but you 2f have not listened;"
Jeremiah,26,6,"Then will I make this house like Shiloh [Place of Rest] , and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth."
Jeremiah,26,7,So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] speaking these words in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
Jeremiah,26,8,"Now it came to pass, when Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] had made an end of speaking all that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had commanded [him] to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, you i shall surely die."
Jeremiah,26,9,"Why have you i prophesied in the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, This house shall be like Shiloh [Place of Rest] , and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,26,10,"When the princes of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] heard these things, then they came up from the king’s house unto the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] [house]."
Jeremiah,26,11,"Then spoke the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man [is] worthy to die; for he has prophesied against this city, as you 2f have heard with your ears."
Jeremiah,26,12,"Then spoke Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you 2f have heard."
Jeremiah,26,13,"Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will repent him of the evil that he has pronounced against you."

Jeremiah,26,15,"But know you 2f for certain, that if you 2f put me to death, you 2f shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a tthe Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears."
Jeremiah,26,16,Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man [is] not worthy to die: for he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered].
Jeremiah,26,17,"Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,26,18,"Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] from Moreshet [possession of Gat (wine-vat)] prophesied in the days of Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and spoke to all the people of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , saying, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; Tziyon [parched place] shall be plowed [like] a field, and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest."
Jeremiah,26,19,"Did Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] put him at all to (to do entirely, do wholly) death? did he not fear the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and besought the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls."
Jeremiah,26,20,"And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Uriyah [Yehovah is my flame] the son of Sh’may’yah [Yehovah hears] of Kiryat-Ye’arim [City of Forests] , who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed]:"
Jeremiah,26,21,"And when Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Uriyah [Yehovah is my flame] heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place];"
Jeremiah,26,22,"And Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] the king sent men into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place], [namely] , Elnatan [God has given] the son of ‘Akhbor [mouse] , and [certain] men with him into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
Jeremiah,26,23,"And they fetched forth Uriyah [Yehovah is my flame] out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and brought him unto Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] the king; who killed him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people."
Jeremiah,26,24,"Nevertheless the hand of Achikam [my brother has arisen] the son of Shafan [coney] was with Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death."
Jeremiah,27,1,"In the beginning of the reign of Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] the son of Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] came this word unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying,"

Jeremiah,27,8,"And it shall come to pass, [that] the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , that nation will I punish, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand."
Jeremiah,27,9,"Therefore hearken not you 2f to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, You 2f shall not serve the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]:"

Jeremiah,30,17,"For I will restore health unto you i , and I will heal you i of your i wounds, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; because they called you i an Outcast, [saying] , This [is] Tziyon [parched place] , whom no man seeks after."

Jeremiah,31,32,"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day [that] I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ; which my covenant they broke, although I was an husband unto them, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):"
Jeremiah,31,33,"But this [shall be] the covenant that I will make with the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; After those days, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and they shall be my people."
Jeremiah,31,34,"And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more."
Jeremiah,31,35,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which gives the sun for a light by day, [and] the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divides the sea when the waves thereof roar; The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] [is] his name:"
Jeremiah,31,36,"If those ordinances depart from before me, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [then] the seed of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] also shall cease from being a nation before me forever."
Jeremiah,31,37,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] for all that they have done, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."

Jeremiah,32,1,"The word that came to Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in the tenth year of Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , which [was] the eighteenth year of N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown]."
Jeremiah,32,2,"For then the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] ’s army besieged Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : and Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which [was] in the king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ’s house."
Jeremiah,32,3,"For Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] had shut him up, saying, For what reason do you i prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and he shall take it;"
Jeremiah,32,4,"And Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] shall not escape out of the hand of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;"
Jeremiah,32,5,"And he shall lead Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] to Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and there shall he be until I visit him, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : though you 2f fight with the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , you 2f shall not prosper."
Jeremiah,32,6,"And Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] said, The word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Jeremiah,32,7,"Behold, ‘Hanam’el [God is gracious] the son of Shalum [retribution] your i uncle shall come unto you i , saying, Buy you i my field that [is] in ‘Anatot [answers to prayer] : for the right of redemption [is] yoursi, so buy [it]."
Jeremiah,32,8,"So ‘Hanam’el [God is gracious] my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray you i , that [is] in ‘Anatot [answers to prayer] , which [is] in the country of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] : for the right of inheritance [is] yoursi, and the redemption [is] yoursi; buy [it] for yourself. Then I knew that this [was] the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,32,9,"And I bought the field of ‘Hanam’el [God is gracious] my uncle’s son, that [was] in ‘Anatot [answers to prayer] , and weighed him the money, [even] seventeen shekels of silver."
Jeremiah,32,10,"And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed [it] , and took witnesses, and weighed [him] the money in the balances."
Jeremiah,32,11,"So I took the evidence of the purchase, [both] that which was sealed [according] to the law and custom, and that which was open:"
Jeremiah,32,12,"And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] the son of Neriyah [lamp of Yehovah] , the son of Ma’aseiyah [work of Yehovah] , in the sight of ‘Hanam’el [God is gracious] my uncle’s [son] , and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Y’hudim (Judeans) that sat in the court of the prison."
Jeremiah,32,13,"And I charged Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] before them, saying,"
Jeremiah,32,14,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days."
Jeremiah,32,15,"For thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land."
Jeremiah,32,16,"Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] the son of Neriyah [lamp of Yehovah] , I prayed unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying,"
Jeremiah,32,17,"Ah Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ! behold, you i have made the heaven and the earth by your i great power and stretched out arm, [and] there is nothing too hard for you i:"
Jeremiah,32,18,"you i show lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies], [is] His Name,"
Jeremiah,32,19,"Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for your i eyes [are] open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give everyone according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:"
Jeremiah,32,20,"Which have set signs and wonders in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place], [even] unto this day, and in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and among [other] men; and have made you i a name, as at this day;"
Jeremiah,32,21,"And have brought forth your i people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;"
Jeremiah,32,22,"And have given them this land, which you i did swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;"
Jeremiah,32,23,"And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not your i voice, neither walked in you i law; they have done nothing of all that you i commanded them to do: therefore you i have caused all this evil to come upon them:"
Jeremiah,32,24,"Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what you i have spoken is come to pass; and, behold, you i see [it]."
Jeremiah,32,25,"And you i have said unto me, O Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , Buy you i the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Kasdim [clod-breakers]."
Jeremiah,32,26,"Then came the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , saying,"
Jeremiah,32,27,"Behold, I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?"
Jeremiah,32,28,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , and into the hand of N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and he shall take it:"
Jeremiah,32,29,"And the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger."
Jeremiah,32,30,"For the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] have only done evil before me from their youth: for the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,32,31,"For this city has been to me [as] a provocation of my anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,"
Jeremiah,32,32,"Because of all the evil of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and of the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Jeremiah,32,33,"And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching [them] , yet they have not listened to receive instruction."
Jeremiah,32,34,"But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it."
Jeremiah,32,35,"And they built the high places of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , which [are] in the valley of the son of Hinnom [Lamentation] , to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through [the fire] unto Molekh [king] ; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] to sin."
Jeremiah,32,36,"And now therefore thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , concerning this city, whereof you 2f say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;"
Jeremiah,32,37,"Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, to which I have driven them in my anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:"
Jeremiah,32,38,"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]:"
Jeremiah,32,39,"And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me forever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:"
Jeremiah,32,40,"And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me."
Jeremiah,32,41,"Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul."
Jeremiah,32,42,"For thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them."
Jeremiah,32,43,"And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof you 2f say, [It is] desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Kasdim [clod-breakers]."
Jeremiah,32,44,"Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal [them] , and take witnesses in the land of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , and in the places about Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and in the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,33,1,"Moreover the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,"
Jeremiah,33,2,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) the maker thereof, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) that formed it, to establish it; the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] his name;"
Jeremiah,33,3,"Call unto me, and I will answer you i , and show you i great and mighty things, which you i know not."
Jeremiah,33,4,"For thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;"
Jeremiah,33,5,"They come to fight with the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , but [it is] to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in my anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city."
Jeremiah,33,6,"Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth."
Jeremiah,33,7,"And I will cause the captivity of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and the captivity of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to return, and will build them, as at the first."
Jeremiah,33,8,"And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me."
Jeremiah,33,9,"And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it."
Jeremiah,33,10,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; Again there shall be heard in this place, which you 2f say [shall be] desolate without man and without beast, [even] in the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and in the streets of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,"
Jeremiah,33,11,"The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] : for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] good; for his mercy [endures] forever: [and] of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,33,12,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing [their] flocks to lie down."
Jeremiah,33,13,"In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , and in the places about Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and in the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that tells [them] , says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,33,14,"Behold, the days come, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and to the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
Jeremiah,33,15,"In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of Righteousness to grow up unto David [beloved] ; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land."
Jeremiah,33,16,"In those days shall Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] be saved, and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] shall dwell safely: and this [is the name] which she shall be called, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our righteousness."
Jeremiah,33,17,For thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; David [beloved] shall never lack a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God];
Jeremiah,33,18,"Neither shall the priests the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] lack a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually."
Jeremiah,33,19,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , saying,"
Jeremiah,33,20,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; If you 2f can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;"
Jeremiah,33,21," [Then] may also my covenant be broken with David [beloved] my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] the priests, my ministers."
Jeremiah,33,22,"As the army of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David [beloved] my servant, and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] that minister unto me."
Jeremiah,33,23,"Moreover the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came to Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , saying,"
Jeremiah,33,24,"Consider you i not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has chosen, he has even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them."
Jeremiah,33,25,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; If my covenant [be] not with day and night, [and if] I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;"
Jeremiah,33,26,"Then will I cast away the seed of Ya’akov [Heal of God] , and David [beloved] my servant, [so] that I will not take [any] of his seed [to be] rulers over the seed of Avraham [Exalted Father] , Yitz’khak [Laughter] , and Ya’akov [Heal of God] : for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them."
Jeremiah,34,1,"The word which came unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , when N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and against all the cities thereof, saying,"
Jeremiah,34,2,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; Go and speak to Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and tell him, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and he shall burn it with fire:"
Jeremiah,34,3,"And you i shall not escape out of his hand, but shall surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and your i eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and he shall speak with you i mouth to mouth, and you i shall go to Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Jeremiah,34,4,"Yet hear the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , O Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ; Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) of you i , you i shall not die by the sword:"
Jeremiah,34,5," [But] you i shall die in peace: and with the burnings of your i fathers, the former kings which were before you i , so shall they burn [odours] for you i ; and they will lament you i, [saying] , Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,34,6,"Then Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] the prophet spoke all these words unto Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace],"
Jeremiah,34,7,"When the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] ’s army fought against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and against all the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] that were left, against Lakhish [Invincible] , and against ‘Azekah [Dug Over] : for these fortified cities remained of the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
Jeremiah,34,8," [This is] the word that came unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , after that the king Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] had made a covenant with all the people which [were] at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , to proclaim liberty unto them;"
Jeremiah,34,9,"That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, [being] an ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew male] or an ‘Evri’ah [Hebrew female] , go free; that none should serve himself of them, [that is to say] , of a Y’hudi (Jewish person) his brother."
Jeremiah,34,10,"Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that everyone should let his manservant, and everyone his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them anymore, then they obeyed, and let [them] go."
Jeremiah,34,11,"But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids."
Jeremiah,34,12,"Therefore the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came to Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying,"
Jeremiah,34,13,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , out of the house of bondmen, saying,"
Jeremiah,34,14,"At the end of seven years let you 2f go every man his brother an ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] , which has been sold unto you i ; and when he has served you i six years, you i shall let him go free from you i : but your fathers listened not unto me, neither inclined their ear."
Jeremiah,34,15,"And you 2f were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and you 2f had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:"
Jeremiah,34,16,"But you 2f turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his female servant, whom you 2f had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids."
Jeremiah,34,17,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; You 2f have not listened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, everyone to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth."
Jeremiah,34,18,"And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in two, and passed between the parts thereof,"
Jeremiah,34,19,"The princes of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and the princes of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;"
Jeremiah,34,20,"I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth."
Jeremiah,34,21,"And Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] ’s army, which are gone up from you."
Jeremiah,34,22,"Behold, I will command, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] a desolation without an inhabitant."
Jeremiah,35,1,"The word which came unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in the days of Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] the son of Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , saying,"
Jeremiah,35,2,"Go unto the house of the Rekhavim [uttermost part] , and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink."
Jeremiah,35,3,"Then I took Ya’azanyahu [Yehovah hears] the son of Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , the son of Havatzinyah [light of Yehovah] , and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rekhavim [uttermost part];"
Jeremiah,35,4,"And I brought them into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , into the chamber of the sons of Hanan [he is merciful] , the son of Yigdalyahu [Yehovah is great] , a man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which [was] by the chamber of the princes, which [was] above the chamber of Ma’aseiyah [work of Yehovah] the son of Shalum [retribution] , the keeper of the door:"
Jeremiah,35,5,"And I set before the sons of the house of the Rekhavim [uttermost part] pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink you 2f wine."
Jeremiah,35,6,"But they said, We will drink no wine: for Yonadav [Yehovah is willing] [Generous] the son of Rekhav [rider] our father commanded us, saying, You 2f shall drink no wine, [neither you 2f ], nor your sons forever:"
Jeremiah,35,7,"Neither shall you 2f build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have [any] : but all your days you 2f shall dwell in tents; that you 2f may live many days in the land where you 2f [be] strangers."
Jeremiah,35,8,"Thus have we obeyed the voice of Yonadav [Yehovah is willing] [Generous] the son of Rekhav [rider] our father in all that he has charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;"
Jeremiah,35,9,"Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:"
Jeremiah,35,10,"But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Yonadav [Yehovah is willing] [Generous] our father commanded us."
Jeremiah,35,11,"But it came to pass, when N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] for fear of the army of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , and for fear of the army of the Aram [Syrians] : so we dwell at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Jeremiah,35,12,"Then came the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , saying,"
Jeremiah,35,13,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; Go and tell the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , Will you 2f not receive instruction to hearken to my words? says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,35,14,"The words of Yonadav [Yehovah is willing] [Generous] the son of Rekhav [rider] , that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father’s commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but you 2f listened not unto me."
Jeremiah,35,15,"I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending [them] , saying, Return you 2f now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and you 2f shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but you 2f have not inclined your ear, nor listened unto me."
Jeremiah,35,16,"Because the sons of Yonadav [Yehovah is willing] [Generous] the son of Rekhav [rider] have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people has not listened unto me:"
Jeremiah,35,17,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; Behold, I will bring upon Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and upon all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered."
Jeremiah,35,18,"And Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] said unto the house of the Rekhavim [uttermost part] , Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; Because you 2f have obeyed the commandment of Yonadav [Yehovah is willing] [Generous] your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he has commanded you:"
Jeremiah,35,19,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; Yonadav [Yehovah is willing] [Generous] the son of Rekhav [rider] shall not lack a man to stand before me forever."
Jeremiah,36,1,"And it came to pass in the fourth year of Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] the son of Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised], [that] this word came unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying,"
Jeremiah,36,2,"Take you i a roll of a book, and write in it all the words that I have spoken unto you i against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and against Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and against all the nations, from the day I spoke unto you i , from the days of Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] , even unto this day."
Jeremiah,36,3,It may be that the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
Jeremiah,36,4,"Then Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] called Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] the son of Neriyah [lamp of Yehovah] : and Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] wrote from the mouth of Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] all the words of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book."
Jeremiah,36,5,"And Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] commanded Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] , saying, I [am] shut up; I cannot go into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):"
Jeremiah,36,6,"Therefore go you i , and read in the roll, which you i have written from my mouth, the words of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in the ears of the people in the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] house upon the fasting day: and also you i shall read them in the ears of all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] that come out of their cities."
Jeremiah,36,7,"It may be they will present their supplication before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and will return everyone from his evil way: for great [is] the anger and the fury that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has pronounced against this people."
Jeremiah,36,8,"And Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] the son of Neriyah [lamp of Yehovah] did according to all that Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] the prophet commanded him, reading in the Book the words of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] house."
Jeremiah,36,9,"And it came to pass in the fifth year of Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] the son of Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , in the ninth month, [that] they proclaimed a fast before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to all the people in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and to all the people that came from the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Jeremiah,36,10,"Then read Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] in the book the words of Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , in the chamber of G’maryah [Yehovah has accomplished] the son of Shafan [coney] the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] house, in the ears of all the people."
Jeremiah,36,11,"When Mikhayah [who is like God?] the son of G’maryah [Yehovah has accomplished] , the son of Shafan [coney] , had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate),"
Jeremiah,36,12,"Then he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, [even] Elishama [My God has Heard] the scribe, and D’layahu [Yehovah has accomplished] the son of Sh’may’yah [Yehovah hears] , and Elnatan [God has given] the son of ‘Akhbor [mouse] , and G’maryah [Yehovah has accomplished] the son of Shafan [coney] , and Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] the son of Hananyah [God has favoured] , and all the princes."
Jeremiah,36,13,"Then Mikhayah [who is like God?] declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] read the book in the ears of the people."
Jeremiah,36,14,"Therefore all the princes sent Y’hudi [the Jewish one] the son of N’tanyah [given of Yehovah] , the son of Shelemyah [repaid by Yehovah] [repaid by Yehovah] , the son of Kushi [their blackness] , unto Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] , saying, Take in your i hand the roll wherein you i have read in the ears of the people, and come. So Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] the son of Neriyah [lamp of Yehovah] took the roll in his hand, and came unto them."
Jeremiah,36,15,"And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] read [it] in their ears."
Jeremiah,36,16,"Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] , We will surely tell the king of all these words."
Jeremiah,36,17,"And they asked Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] , saying, Tell us now, How did you i write all these words at his mouth?"
Jeremiah,36,18,"Then Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote [them] with ink in the book."
Jeremiah,36,19,"Then said the princes unto Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] , Go, hide you i , you i and Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] ; and let no man know where you 2f be."
Jeremiah,36,20,"And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama [My God has Heard] the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king."
Jeremiah,36,21,"So the king sent Y’hudi [the Jewish one] to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama [My God has Heard] the scribe’s chamber. And Y’hudi [the Jewish one] read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king."
Jeremiah,36,22,Now the king sat in the winter house in the ninth month: and [there was a fire] on the hearth burning before him.
Jeremiah,36,23,"And it came to pass, [that] when Y’hudi [the Jewish one] had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast [it] into the fire that [was] on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that [was] on the hearth."
Jeremiah,36,24,"Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, [neither] the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words."
Jeremiah,36,25,Nevertheless Elnatan [God has given] and D’layahu [Yehovah has accomplished] and G’maryah [Yehovah has accomplished] had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.
Jeremiah,36,26,"But the king commanded Yerachme’el [my God have pity] the son of the king, and S’rayah [Yehovah is ruler] the son of ‘Azri’el [my help is God] , and Shelemyah [repaid by Yehovah] [repaid by Yehovah] the son of ‘Acde’el [servant of God] , to take Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] the scribe and Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] the prophet: but the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) hid them."
Jeremiah,36,27,"Then the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came to Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] wrote at the mouth of Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , saying,"
Jeremiah,36,28,"Take you i again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] the king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] has burned."
Jeremiah,36,29,"And you i shall say to Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; you i have burned this roll, saying, Why have you i written in it, saying, The king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from there man and beast?"
Jeremiah,36,30,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) of Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David [beloved] : and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost."
Jeremiah,36,31,"And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and upon the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they listened not."
Jeremiah,36,32,"Then took Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] another roll, and gave it to Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] the scribe, the son of Neriyah [lamp of Yehovah] ; who wrote in it from the mouth of Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] all the words of the book which Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words."
Jeremiah,37,1,"And king Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] the son of Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] reigned instead of Koniyahu [Yehovah will establish] the son of Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] , whom N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] made king in the land of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
Jeremiah,37,2,"But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he spoke by the prophet Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed]."
Jeremiah,37,3,"And Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] the king sent Y’hukhal [Yehovah is able] the son of Shelemyah [repaid by Yehovah] [repaid by Yehovah] and Tzefan’yahu [Yehovah has treasured] the son of Ma’aseiyah [work of Yehovah] the priest to the prophet Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , saying, Pray now unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] for us."
Jeremiah,37,4,Now Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.
Jeremiah,37,5,"Then Par’oh’s [Pharaoh - Great House] army was come forth out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : and when the Kasdim [clod-breakers] that besieged Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] heard tidings of them, they departed from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Jeremiah,37,6,"Then came the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto the prophet Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , saying,"
Jeremiah,37,7,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; Thus shall you 2f say to the king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Par’oh’s [Pharaoh - Great House] army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] into their own land."
Jeremiah,37,8,"And the Kasdim [clod-breakers] shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire."
Jeremiah,37,9,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Kasdim [clod-breakers] shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart."
Jeremiah,37,10,"For though you 2f had smitten the whole army of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] that fight against you, and there remained [but] wounded men among them, [yet] should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire."
Jeremiah,37,11,"And it came to pass, that when the army of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] was broken up from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] for fear of Par’oh’s [Pharaoh - Great House] army,"
Jeremiah,37,12,"Then Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] went forth out of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to go into the land of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , to separate himself there in the midst of the people."
Jeremiah,37,13,"And when he was in the gate of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , a captain of the ward (in custody, with a guard; prison) [was] there, whose name [was] Yir’iyah [speak] , the son of Shelemyah [repaid by Yehovah] [repaid by Yehovah] , the son of Hananyah [God has favoured] ; and he took Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] the prophet, saying, you i fall away to the Kasdim [clod-breakers]."
Jeremiah,37,14,"Then said Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed], [It is] false; I fall not away to the Kasdim [clod-breakers] . But he listened not to him: so Yir’iyah [speak] took Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , and brought him to the princes."
Jeremiah,37,15,"For what reason the princes were exceedingly angry with Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] the scribe: for they had made that the prison."
Jeremiah,37,16,"When Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] had remained there many days;"
Jeremiah,37,17,"Then Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there [any] word from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ? And Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] said, There is: for, said he, you i shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Jeremiah,37,18,"Moreover Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] said unto king Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] , What have I offended against you i , or against your i servants, or against this people, that you 2f have put me in prison?"
Jeremiah,37,19,"Where [are] now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] shall not come against you, nor against this land?"
Jeremiah,37,20,"Therefore hear now, I pray you i , O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray you i , be accepted before you i ; that you i cause me not to return to the house of Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] the scribe, lest I die there."
Jeremiah,37,21,"Then Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] the king commanded that they should commit Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] remained in the court of the prison."
Jeremiah,38,1,"Then Sh’fatyah [Yehovah has judged] the son of Mattan [a gift] , and G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] the son of Pash’chur [freedom] , and Yukhal [Yehovah is able] the son of Shelemyah [repaid by Yehovah] [repaid by Yehovah] , and Pash’chur [freedom] the son of Malkiyah [my king is Yehovah] , heard the words that Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] had spoken unto all the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,38,2,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , He that remains in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goes forth to the Kasdim [clod-breakers] shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live."
Jeremiah,38,3,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] ’s army, which shall take it."
Jeremiah,38,4,"Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , let this man be put to death: for thus he weakens the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeks not the welfare of this people, but the hurt."
Jeremiah,38,5,"Then Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] the king said, Behold, he [is] in your hand: for the king [is] not [he that] can do [any] thing against you."
Jeremiah,38,6,"Then took they Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , and cast him into the dungeon of Malkiyah [my king is Yehovah] the son of the king, that [was] in the court of the prison: and they let down Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] with cords. And in the dungeon [there was] no water, but mire: so Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] sunk in the mire."
Jeremiah,38,7,"Now when ‘Eved-Melekh [servant of the king] the Cushi (Ethiopian) , one of the eunuchs which was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength];"
Jeremiah,38,8,"‘Eved-Melekh [servant of the king] went forth out of the king’s house, and spoke to the king, saying,"
Jeremiah,38,9,"My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for [there is] no more bread in the city."
Jeremiah,38,10,"Then the king commanded ‘Eved-Melekh [servant of the king] the Cushi (Ethiopian) , saying, Take from hence thirty men with you i , and take up Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die."
Jeremiah,38,11,"So ‘Eved-Melekh [servant of the king] took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took there old cast clouts (pieces of cloth used to patch) and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed]."
Jeremiah,38,12,"And ‘Eved-Melekh [servant of the king] the Cushi (Ethiopian) said unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , Put now [these] old cast clouts (pieces of cloth used to patch) and rotten rags under your i armholes under the cords. And Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] did so."
Jeremiah,38,13,"So they drew up Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] remained in the court of the prison."
Jeremiah,38,14,"Then Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] the king sent, and took Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] the prophet unto him into the third entry that [is] in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and the king said unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , I will ask you i a thing; hide nothing from me."
Jeremiah,38,15,"Then Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] said unto Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] , If I declare [it] unto you i , will you i not surely put me to death? and if I give you i counsel, will you i not hearken unto me?"
Jeremiah,38,16,"So Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] the king swore secretly unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , saying, [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, that made us this soul, I will not put you i to death, neither will I give you i into the hand of these men that seek your i life."
Jeremiah,38,17,"Then said Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] unto Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] , Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; If you i will assuredly go forth unto the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity)’s (Babylon) [confusion] ’s princes, then your i soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and you i shall live, and your i house:"
Jeremiah,38,18,"But if you i will not go forth to the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity)’s (Babylon) [confusion] ’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , and they shall burn it with fire, and you i shall not escape out of their hand."
Jeremiah,38,19,"And Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] the king said unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , I am afraid of the Y’hudim (Judeans) that are fallen to the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me."
Jeremiah,38,20,"But Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] said, They shall not deliver [you i ] . Obey, I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which I speak unto you i : so it shall be well unto you i , and your i soul shall live."
Jeremiah,38,21,"But if you i refuse to go forth, this [is] the word that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has showed me:"
Jeremiah,38,22,"And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ’s house [shall be] brought forth to the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] ’s princes, and those [women] shall say, Your 1s friends have set you i on, and have prevailed against you i : your i feet are sunk in the mire, [and] they are turned away back."
Jeremiah,38,23,"So they shall bring out all your i wives and your i children to the Kasdim [clod-breakers] : and you i shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] : and you i shall cause this city to be burned with fire."
Jeremiah,38,24,"Then said Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , Let no man know of these words, and you i shall not die."
Jeremiah,38,25,"But if the princes hear that I have talked with you i , and they come unto you i , and say unto you i , Declare unto us now what you i have said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put you i to death; also what the king said unto you i:"
Jeremiah,38,26,"Then you i shall say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Y’honatan’s [Yehovah has Given] ’s house, to die there."
Jeremiah,38,27,"Then came all the princes unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived."
Jeremiah,38,28,So Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] abode in the court of the prison until the day that Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] was taken: and he was [there] when Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] was taken.
Jeremiah,39,1,"In the ninth year of Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , in the tenth month, came N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] and all his army against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and they besieged it."
Jeremiah,39,2," [And] in the eleventh year of Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] , in the fourth month, the ninth [day] of the month, the city was broken up."
Jeremiah,39,3,"And all the princes of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] came in, and sat in the middle gate, [even] Nergal-Sar’etzer [prince of fire] , Samgar-N’vo [sword of Nebo] , Sars’khim [prince of eunuchs] , Rav-Saris [chief eunuch] , Nergal-Sar’etzer [prince of fire] , Rav-Mag [chief magician] , with all the residue (part that remains, the rest) of the princes of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Jeremiah,39,4,"And it came to pass, [that] when Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] the king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, by the gate between the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain."
Jeremiah,39,5,"But the Kasdim [clod-breakers] army pursued after them, and overtook Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] in the plains of Yericho [Its Moon] : and when they had taken him, they brought him up to N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] to Rivlah [Fertility] in the land of Hamat [Fortress] , where he gave judgment upon him."
Jeremiah,39,6,"Then the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] killed the sons of Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] in Rivlah [Fertility] before his eyes: also the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] killed all the nobles of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
Jeremiah,39,7,"Moreover he put out Tzidkiyah’s [Yehovah is righteous] ’s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Jeremiah,39,8,"And the Kasdim [clod-breakers] burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Jeremiah,39,9,"Then N’vuzar’adan [Nebo has given seed] the captain of the guard carried away captive into Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained."
Jeremiah,39,10,"But N’vuzar’adan [Nebo has given seed] the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time."
Jeremiah,39,11,"Now N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] gave charge concerning Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] to N’vuzar’adan [Nebo has given seed] the captain of the guard, saying,"
Jeremiah,39,12,"Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto you i."
Jeremiah,39,13,"So N’vuzar’adan [Nebo has given seed] the captain of the guard sent, and N’vushazban [Nebo delivers me] , Rav-Saris [chief eunuch] , and Nergal-Sar’etzer [prince of fire] , Rav-Mag [chief magician] , and all the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity)’s (Babylon) [confusion] ’s princes;"
Jeremiah,39,14,"Even they sent, and took Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] the son of Achikam [my brother has arisen] the son of Shafan [coney] , that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people."
Jeremiah,39,15,"Now the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,"
Jeremiah,39,16,"Go and speak to ‘Eved-Melekh [servant of the king] the Cushi (Ethiopian) , saying, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be [accomplished] in that day before you i."
Jeremiah,39,17,"But I will deliver you i in that day, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and you i shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you i [are] afraid."
Jeremiah,39,18,"For I will surely deliver you i , and you i shall not fall by the sword, but your i life shall be for a prey unto you i : because you i have put your i trust in me, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,40,1,"The word that came to Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , after that N’vuzar’adan [Nebo has given seed] the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah [Hill] , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , which were carried away captive unto Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Jeremiah,40,2,"And the captain of the guard took Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , and said unto him, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has pronounced this evil upon this place."
Jeremiah,40,3,"Now the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has brought [it] , and done according as he has said: because you 2f have sinned against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you."
Jeremiah,40,4,"And now, behold, I loose you i this day from the chains which [were] upon your i hand. If it seem good unto you i to come with me into Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , come; and I will look well unto you i : but if it seem ill unto you i to come with me into Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , refrain (restrain; refrein from acting) : behold, all the land [is] before you i : to which it seems good and convenient (fit; appropriate; proper (one’s own; peculiar; particular)) for you i to go, there go."
Jeremiah,40,5,"Now while he was not yet gone back, [he said] , Go back also to G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] the son of Achikam [my brother has arisen] the son of Shafan [coney] , whom the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] has made governor over the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and dwell with him among the people: or go wherever it seems convenient (fit; appropriate; proper (one’s own; peculiar; particular)) unto you i to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals (food for humans) and a reward, and let him go."
Jeremiah,40,6,Then went Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] unto G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] the son of Achikam [my brother has arisen] to Mitzpah [watchtower] ; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.
Jeremiah,40,7,"Now when all the captains of the forces which [were] in the fields, [even] they and their men, heard that the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] had made G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] the son of Achikam [my brother has arisen] governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion];"
Jeremiah,40,8,"Then they came to G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] to Mitzpah [watchtower] , even Yishma’el [God will hear] the son of N’tanyah [given of Yehovah] , and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] the sons of Kareach [bald] , and S’rayah [Yehovah is ruler] the son of Tanchumet [consolation] , and the sons of ‘Efai [gloomy] the N’tofati [dropping] , and Y’zanyahu [Yehovah has listened] the son of a Ma’akhati [pressure (literally, she has pressed)] , they and their men."
Jeremiah,40,9,"And G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] the son of Achikam [my brother has arisen] the son of Shafan [coney] swore unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Kasdim [clod-breakers] : dwell in the land, and serve the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and it shall be well with you."
Jeremiah,40,10,"As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mitzpah [watchtower] to serve the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , which will come unto us: but you 2f , gather your 2f wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put [them] in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you 2f have taken."
Jeremiah,40,11,"Likewise when all the Y’hudim (Judeans) that [were] in Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , and among the ‘Amon [Inbred] , and in Edom [Red] , and that [were] in all the countries, heard that the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] had left a remnant of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and that he had set over them G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] the son of Achikam [my brother has arisen] the son of Shafan [coney];"
Jeremiah,40,12,"Even all the Y’hudim (Judeans) returned out of all places to which they were driven, and came to the land of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , to G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] , unto Mitzpah [watchtower] , and gathered wine and summer fruits very much."
Jeremiah,40,13,"Moreover Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the son of Kareach [bald] , and all the captains of the forces that [were] in the fields, came to G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] to Mitzpah [watchtower],"
Jeremiah,40,14,"And said unto him, Do you i certainly know that Ba’al [lord (a false god)] is the king of the ‘Amon [Inbred] has sent Yishma’el [God will hear] the son of N’tanyah [given of Yehovah] to slay you i ? But G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] the son of Achikam [my brother has arisen] believed them not."
Jeremiah,40,15,"Then Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the son of Kareach [bald] spoke to G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] in Mitzpah [watchtower] secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray you i , and I will slay Yishma’el [God will hear] the son of N’tanyah [given of Yehovah] , and no man shall know [it] : wherefore should he slay you i , that all the Y’hudim (Judeans) which are gathered unto you i should be scattered, and the remnant in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] perish?"
Jeremiah,40,16,"But G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] the son of Achikam [my brother has arisen] said unto Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the son of Kareach [bald] , you i shall not do this thing: for you i speak falsely of Yishma’el [God will hear]."
Jeremiah,41,1,"Now it came to pass in the seventh month, [that] Yishma’el [God will hear] the son of N’tanyah [given of Yehovah] the son of Elishama [My God has Heard] , of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] the son of Achikam [my brother has arisen] to Mitzpah [watchtower] ; and there they did eat bread together in Mitzpah [watchtower]."
Jeremiah,41,2,"Then arose Yishma’el [God will hear] the son of N’tanyah [given of Yehovah] , and the ten men that were with him, and struck G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] the son of Achikam [my brother has arisen] the son of Shafan [coney] with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] had made governor over the land."
Jeremiah,41,3,"Yishma’el [God will hear] also killed all the Y’hudim (Judeans) that were with him, [even] with G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] , at Mitzpah [watchtower] , and the Kasdim [clod-breakers] that were found there, [and] the men of war."
Jeremiah,41,4,"And it came to pass the second day after he had slain G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] , and no man knew [it],"
Jeremiah,41,5,"That there came certain from Sh’khem [Shoulder] , from Shiloh [Place of Rest] , and from Shomron [watch mountain], [even] eighty men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring [them] to the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jeremiah,41,6,"And Yishma’el [God will hear] the son of N’tanyah [given of Yehovah] went forth from Mitzpah [watchtower] to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] the son of Achikam [my brother has arisen]."
Jeremiah,41,7,"And it was [so] , when they came into the midst of the city, that Yishma’el [God will hear] the son of N’tanyah [given of Yehovah] killed them, [and cast them] into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that [were] with him."
Jeremiah,41,8,"But ten men were found among them that said unto Yishma’el [God will hear] , Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and killed them not among their brethren."
Jeremiah,41,9,"Now the pit wherein Yishma’el [God will hear] had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great], [was] it which Asa [healer; injurious?] the king had made for fear of Ba’sha [wicked] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]: [and] Yishma’el [God will hear] the son of N’tanyah [given of Yehovah] filled it with [them that were] slain."
Jeremiah,41,10,"Then Yishma’el [God will hear] carried away captive all the residue (part that remains, the rest) of the people that [were] in Mitzpah [watchtower], [even] the king’s daughters, and all the people that remained in Mitzpah [watchtower] , whom N’vuzar’adan [Nebo has given seed] the captain of the guard had committed to G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] the son of Achikam [my brother has arisen] : and Yishma’el [God will hear] the son of N’tanyah [given of Yehovah] carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the ‘Amon [Inbred]."
Jeremiah,41,11,"But when Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the son of Kareach [bald] , and all the captains of the forces that [were] with him, heard of all the evil that Yishma’el [God will hear] the son of N’tanyah [given of Yehovah] had done,"
Jeremiah,41,12,"Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Yishma’el [God will hear] the son of N’tanyah [given of Yehovah] , and found him by the great waters that [are] in Giv’on [Hill City]."
Jeremiah,41,13,"Now it came to pass, [that] when all the people which [were] with Yishma’el [God will hear] saw Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the son of Kareach [bald] , and all the captains of the forces that [were] with him, then they were glad."
Jeremiah,41,14,"So all the people that Yishma’el [God will hear] had carried away captive from Mitzpah [watchtower] cast about and returned, and went unto Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the son of Kareach [bald]."
Jeremiah,41,15,"But Yishma’el [God will hear] the son of N’tanyah [given of Yehovah] escaped from Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] with eight men, and went to the ‘Amon [Inbred]."
Jeremiah,41,16,"Then took Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the son of Kareach [bald] , and all the captains of the forces that [were] with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Yishma’el [God will hear] the son of N’tanyah [given of Yehovah] , from Mitzpah [watchtower] , after [that] he had slain G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] the son of Achikam [my brother has arisen], [even] mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Giv’on [Hill City]:"
Jeremiah,41,17,"And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Khimham [their longing] , which is by Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] , to go to enter into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place],"
Jeremiah,41,18,"Because of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] : for they were afraid of them, because Yishma’el [God will hear] the son of N’tanyah [given of Yehovah] had slain G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] the son of Achikam [my brother has arisen] , whom the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] made governor in the land."
Jeremiah,42,1,"Then all the captains of the forces, and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the son of Kareach [bald] , and Y’zanyahu [Yehovah has listened] the son of Hosha’yah [Yehovah has saved] , and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,"
Jeremiah,42,2,"And said unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] the prophet, Let, we beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , our supplication be accepted before you i , and pray for us unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered], [even] for all this remnant; (for we are left [but] a few of many, as you i eyes do behold us)"
Jeremiah,42,3,"That the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] may show us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do."
Jeremiah,42,4,"Then Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] the prophet said unto them, I have heard [you] ; behold, I will pray unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] according to your words; and it shall come to pass, [that] whatsoever thing the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall answer you, I will declare [it] unto you; I will keep nothing back from you."
Jeremiah,42,5,"Then they said to Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shall send you i to us."
Jeremiah,42,6,"Whether [it be] good, or whether [it be] evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , to whom we send you i ; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Jeremiah,42,7,"And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed]."
Jeremiah,42,8,"Then called he Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the son of Kareach [bald] , and all the captains of the forces which [were] with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,"
Jeremiah,42,9,"And said unto them, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , unto whom you 2f sent me to present your supplication before him;"
Jeremiah,42,10,"If you 2f will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull [you] down, and I will plant you, and not pluck [you] up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you."
Jeremiah,42,11,"Be not afraid of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , of whom you 2f are afraid; be not afraid of him, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : for I [am] with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand."
Jeremiah,42,12,"And I will show mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land."
Jeremiah,42,13,"But if you 2f say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered],"
Jeremiah,42,14,"Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:"
Jeremiah,42,15,"And now therefore hear the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , you 2f remnant of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ; Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; If you 2f wholly set your faces to enter into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and go to sojourn there;"
Jeremiah,42,16,"Then it shall come to pass, [that] the sword, which you 2f feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and the famine, whereof you 2f were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ; and there you 2f shall die."
Jeremiah,42,17,"So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them."
Jeremiah,42,18,"For thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; As my anger and my fury has been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when you 2f shall enter into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : and you 2f shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach (disgrace; shame) ; and you 2f shall see this place no more."
Jeremiah,42,19,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has said concerning you, O you 2f remnant of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ; Go you 2f not into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : know certainly that I have admonished you this day."
Jeremiah,42,20,"For you 2f dissembled (used deceit; pretended; feigned) in your hearts, when you 2f sent me unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , saying, Pray for us unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; and according unto all that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do [it]."
Jeremiah,42,21,"And [now] I have this day declared [it] to you; but you 2f have not obeyed the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , nor any [thing] for the which he has sent me unto you."
Jeremiah,42,22,"Now therefore know certainly that you 2f shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place to which you 2f desire to go [and] to sojourn."
Jeremiah,43,1,"And it came to pass, [that] when Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , for which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had sent him to them, [even] all these words,"
Jeremiah,43,2,"Then spoke ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] the son of Hosha’yah [Yehovah has saved] , and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the son of Kareach [bald] , and all the proud men, saying unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , you i speak falsely: the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has not sent you i to say, Go not into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] to sojourn there:"
Jeremiah,43,3,"But Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] the son of Neriyah [lamp of Yehovah] sets you i on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Jeremiah,43,4,"So Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the son of Kareach [bald] , and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to dwell in the land of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
Jeremiah,43,5,"But Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the son of Kareach [bald] , and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , that were returned from all nations, to which they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised];"
Jeremiah,43,6," [Even] men, and women, and children, and the king’s daughters, and every person that N’vuzar’adan [Nebo has given seed] the captain of the guard had left with G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] the son of Achikam [my brother has arisen] the son of Shafan [coney] , and Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] the prophet, and Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] the son of Neriyah [lamp of Yehovah]."
Jeremiah,43,7,So they came into the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : for they obeyed not the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : thus came they [even] to Tachpanches [you will fill hands with pity].
Jeremiah,43,8,"Then came the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] in Tachpanches [you will fill hands with pity] , saying,"
Jeremiah,43,9,"Take great stones in you i hand, and hide them in the clay in the brick factory, which [is] at the entry of Par’oh’s [Pharaoh - Great House] house in Tachpanches [you will fill hands with pity] , in the sight of the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised];"
Jeremiah,43,10,"And say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; Behold, I will send and take N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them."
Jeremiah,43,11,"And when he comes, he shall strike the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place], [and deliver] such [as are] for death to death; and such [as are] for captivity to captivity; and such [as are] for the sword to the sword."
Jeremiah,43,12,"And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array (to put on; to clothe) himself with the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he shall go forth from there in peace."
Jeremiah,43,13,"He shall break also the images of Beit-Shemesh [House of the Sun] , that [is] in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ; and the houses of the gods of the Mitzri shall he burn with fire."
Jeremiah,44,1,"The word that came to Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] concerning all the Y’hudim (Judeans) which dwell in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , which dwell at Migdol [Tower] , and at Tachpanches [you will fill hands with pity] , and at Nof [presentability] , and in the country of Patros [region of the south] , saying,"
Jeremiah,44,2,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; You 2f have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and upon all the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ; and, behold, this day they [are] a desolation, and no man dwells in it,"
Jeremiah,44,3,"Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, [and] to serve other gods, whom they knew not, [neither] they, you 2f , nor your fathers."
Jeremiah,44,4,"However I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending [them] , saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate."
Jeremiah,44,5,"But they listened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods."
Jeremiah,44,6,"For what reason my fury and my anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and in the streets of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; and they are wasted [and] desolate, as at this day."
Jeremiah,44,7,"Therefore now thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; For what reason commit you 2f [this] great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , to leave you none to remain;"
Jeremiah,44,8,"In that you 2f provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , to which you 2f be gone to dwell, that you 2f might cut yourselves off, and that you 2f might be a curse and a reproach (disgrace; shame) among all the nations of the earth?"
Jeremiah,44,9,"Have you 2f forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and in the streets of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]?"
Jeremiah,44,10,"They are not humbled [even] unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers."
Jeremiah,44,11,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
Jeremiah,44,12,"And I will take the remnant of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , that have set their faces to go into the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, [and] fall in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ; they shall [even] be consumed by the sword [and] by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, [and] an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach (disgrace; shame)."
Jeremiah,44,13,"For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , as I have punished Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:"
Jeremiah,44,14,"So that none of the remnant of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , which are gone into the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape."
Jeremiah,44,15,"Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , in Patros [region of the south] , answered Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , saying,"
Jeremiah,44,16," [As for] the word that you i have spoken unto us in the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , we will not hearken unto you i."
Jeremiah,44,17,"But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and in the streets of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : for [then] had we plenty of victuals (food for humans) , and were well, and saw no evil."
Jeremiah,44,18,"But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all [things] , and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine."
Jeremiah,44,19,"And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?"
Jeremiah,44,20,"Then Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him [that] answer, saying,"
Jeremiah,44,21,"The incense that you 2f burned in the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and in the streets of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , you 2f , and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) remember them, and came it [not] into his mind?"
Jeremiah,44,22,"So that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, [and] because of the abominations which you 2f have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day."
Jeremiah,44,23,"Because you 2f have burned incense, and because you 2f have sinned against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day."
Jeremiah,44,24,"Moreover Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] that [are] in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]:"
Jeremiah,44,25,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying; You 2f and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: you 2f will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows."
Jeremiah,44,26,"Therefore hear you 2f the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] that dwell in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] in all the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , saying, The Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) lives."
Jeremiah,44,27,"Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] that [are] in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them."
Jeremiah,44,28,"Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] into the land of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and all the remnant of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , that are gone into the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, my, or theirs."
Jeremiah,44,29,"And this [shall be] a sign unto you, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that I will punish you in this place, that you 2f may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:"
Jeremiah,44,30,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hofra [the great house - covering evil] king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] into the hand of N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , his enemy, and that sought his life."
Jeremiah,45,1,"The word that Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] the prophet spoke unto Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)] the son of Neriyah [lamp of Yehovah] , when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] , in the fourth year of Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] the son of Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , saying,"
Jeremiah,45,2,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , unto you i , O Barukh [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)];"
Jeremiah,45,3,"you i did say, Woe is me now! for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest."
Jeremiah,45,4,"Thus shall you i say unto him, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) says thus; Behold, [that] which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land."
Jeremiah,45,5,"And seek you i great things for yourself? seek [them] not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : but you i life will I give unto you i for a prey in all places to which you i go."
Jeremiah,46,1,The word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) which came to Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] the prophet against the Gentiles;

Jeremiah,52,3,"For through the anger of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) it came to pass in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , till he had cast them out from his presence, that Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] rebelled against the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Jeremiah,52,4,"And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, [that] N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] came, he and all his army, against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about."
Jeremiah,52,5,So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous].
Jeremiah,52,6,"And in the fourth month, in the ninth [day] of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land."
Jeremiah,52,7,"Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which [was] by the king’s garden; (now the Kasdim [clod-breakers] [were] by the city round about) and they went by the way of the plain."
Jeremiah,52,8,"But the army of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] pursued after the king, and overtook Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] in the plains of Yericho [Its Moon] ; and all his army was scattered from him."
Jeremiah,52,9,"Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] to Rivlah [Fertility] in the land of Hamat [Fortress] ; where he gave judgment upon him."
Jeremiah,52,10,"And the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] killed the sons of Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] before his eyes: he killed also all the princes of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] in Rivlah [Fertility]."
Jeremiah,52,11,"Then he put out the eyes of Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] ; and the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] bound him in chains, and carried him to Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and put him in prison till the day of his death."
Jeremiah,52,12,"Now in the fifth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, which [was] the nineteenth year of N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , came N’vuzar’adan [Nebo has given seed] , captain of the guard, [which] served the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , into Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace],"
Jeremiah,52,13,"And burned the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the king’s house; and all the houses of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and all the houses of the great [men] , burned he with fire:"
Jeremiah,52,14,"And all the army of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , that [were] with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] round about."
Jeremiah,52,15,"Then N’vuzar’adan [Nebo has given seed] the captain of the guard carried away captive [certain] of the poor of the people, and the residue (part that remains, the rest) of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and the rest of the multitude."
Jeremiah,52,16,But N’vuzar’adan [Nebo has given seed] the captain of the guard left [certain] of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.
Jeremiah,52,17,"Also the pillars of brass that [were] in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the bases, and the brazen sea that [was] in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the Kasdim [clod-breakers] broke, and carried all the brass of them to Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Jeremiah,52,18,"The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass which they ministered, took they away."
Jeremiah,52,19,"And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; [that] which [was] of gold [in] gold, and [that] which [was] of silver [in] silver, took the captain of the guard away."
Jeremiah,52,20,"The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that [were] under the bases, which king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] had made in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : the brass of all these vessels was without weight."
Jeremiah,52,21,"And [concerning] the pillars, the height of one pillar [was] eighteen cubits; and a fillet (an ornamental band around the top of a pillar; a thin band or strip) of twelve cubits did compass (go around, encircle; encompass) it; and the thickness thereof [was] four fingers: [it was] hollow."
Jeremiah,52,22,"And a column of brass [was] upon it; and the height of one column [was] five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the columns round about, all [of] brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates [were] like unto these."
Jeremiah,52,23,And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; [and] all the pomegranates upon the network [were] an hundred round about.
Jeremiah,52,24,"And the captain of the guard took S’rayah [Yehovah is ruler] the chief priest, and Tzefan’yahu [Yehovah has treasured] the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:"
Jeremiah,52,25,"He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king’s person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city."
Jeremiah,52,26,"So N’vuzar’adan [Nebo has given seed] the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] to Rivlah [Fertility]."
Jeremiah,52,27,"And the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] struck them, and put them to death in Rivlah [Fertility] in the land of Hamat [Fortress] . Thus Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] was carried away captive out of his own land."
Jeremiah,52,28,This [is] the people whom N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Y’hudim (Judeans) and three and twenty:
Jeremiah,52,29,In the eighteenth year of N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] he carried away captive from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] eight hundred thirty and two persons:
Jeremiah,52,30,In the three and twentieth year of N’vukhadretzar [may Nebo protect the crown] N’vuzar’adan [Nebo has given seed] the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Y’hudim (Judeans) seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons [were] four thousand and six hundred.
Jeremiah,52,31,"And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Y’hoyakhin [Yehovah establishes] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth [day] of the month, [that] Eveel-M’rodakh [man of bitter contrition] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] in the [first] year of his reign lifted up the head of Y’hoyakhin [Yehovah establishes] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and brought him forth out of prison,"
Jeremiah,52,32,"And spoke kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that [were] with him in Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion],"
Jeremiah,52,33,And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.
Jeremiah,52,34,"And [for] his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life."
