Job,1,1,"There was a man in the land of ‘Utz [wooded] , whose name [was] Iyov [hated] ; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and eschewed evil."
Job,1,2,And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
Job,1,3,"His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east."
Job,1,4,"And his sons went and feasted [in their] houses, everyone his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them."
Job,1,5,"And it was so, when the days of [their] feasting were gone about, that Iyov [hated] sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings [according] to the number of them all: for Iyov [hated] said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in their hearts. Thus did Iyov [hated] continually."
Job,1,6,"Now there was a day when the sons of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] came to present themselves before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and Satan came also among them."
Job,1,7,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Satan, Whence come you i ? Then Satan answered the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it."
Job,1,8,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Satan, Have you i considered my servant Iyov [hated] , that [there is] none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and eschews evil?"
Job,1,9,"Then Satan answered the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, Does Iyov [hated] fear God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] for nothing?"
Job,1,10,"Have not you i made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has on every side? you i have Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land."
Job,1,11,"But put forth you i hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse you i to you i face."
Job,1,12,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Satan, Behold, all that he has [is] in you i power; only upon himself put not forth you i hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Job,1,13,And there was a day when his sons and his daughters [were] eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house:
Job,1,14,"And there came a messenger unto Iyov [hated] , and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:"
Job,1,15,"And the S’va [drunkards] fell [upon them] , and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you i."
Job,1,16,"While he [was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] is fallen from heaven, and has burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell you i."
Job,1,17,"While he [was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Kasdim [clod-breakers] made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yes, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you i."
Job,1,18,"While he [was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, You 1s sons and you i daughters [were] eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house:"
Job,1,19,"And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell you i."
Job,1,20,"Then Iyov [hated] arose, and rent his Mantle (cloak; covering garment) (cloak) , and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,"
Job,1,21,"And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there: the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) gave, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has taken away; Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) be the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Job,1,22,"In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] foolishly."
Job,2,1,"Again there was a day when the sons of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] came to present themselves before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Job,2,2,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Satan, From what place come you i ? And Satan answered the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it."
Job,2,3,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Satan, Have you i considered my servant Iyov [hated] , that [there is] none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and eschews evil? and still he holds fast his integrity, although you i moved me against him, to destroy him without cause."
Job,2,4,"And Satan answered the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, Skin for skin, yes, all that a man has will he give for his life."
Job,2,5,"But put forth you i hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you i to you i face."
Job,2,6,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Satan, Behold, he [is] in your i hand; but save his life."
Job,2,7,"So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and struck Iyov [hated] with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown."
Job,2,8,And he took him a potsherd (piece of broken pottery) to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.
Job,2,9,"Then said his wife unto him, Do you i still retain you i integrity? curse God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and die."
Job,2,10,"But he said unto her, you i speak as one of the foolish women speaks. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Iyov [hated] sin with his lips."
Job,2,11,"Now when Iyov’s [hated] three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Elifaz [my God is (fine) gold] the Temani [southward] , and Bildad [confusing by mingling love] the Shuchi [wealth] , and Tzofar [sparrow] the Na’amti [pleasantness] : for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him."
Job,2,12,"And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his Mantle (cloak; covering garment) (cloak) , and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven."
Job,2,13,"So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word unto him: for they saw that [his] grief was very great."
Job,3,1,"After this opened Iyov [hated] his mouth, and cursed his day."
Job,3,2,"And Iyov [hated] spoke, and said,"
Job,3,3,"Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night [in which] it was said, There is a man child conceived."
Job,3,4,"Let that day be darkness; let not God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it."
Job,3,5,Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
Job,3,6,"As [for] that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months."
Job,3,7,"Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come in it."
Job,3,8,"Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning."
Job,3,9,"Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but [have] none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:"
Job,3,10,"Because it shut not up the doors of my [mother’s] womb, nor hid sorrow from my eyes."
Job,3,11,Why died I not from the womb? [why] did I [not] give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
Job,3,12,Why did the knees prevent (come before; go before; anticipate) me? or why the breasts that I should suck?
Job,3,13,"For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,"
Job,3,14,"With kings and counselors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;"
Job,3,15,"Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:"
Job,3,16,Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants [which] never saw light.
Job,3,17,There the wicked cease [from] troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
Job,3,18, [There] the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
Job,3,19,The small and great are there; and the servant [is] free from his master.
Job,3,20,"For what reason is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter [in] soul;"
Job,3,21,"Which long for death, but it [comes] not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;"
Job,3,22,"Which rejoice exceedingly, [and] are glad, when they can find the grave?"
Job,3,23," [Why is light given] to a man whose way is hid, and whom God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has hedged in?"
Job,3,24,"For my sighing comes before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters."
Job,3,25,"For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me."
Job,3,26,"I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came."
Job,4,1,"Then Elifaz [my God is (fine) gold] the Temani [southward] answered and said,"
Job,4,2," [If] we assay to commune with you i , will you i be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?"
Job,4,3,"Behold, you i have instructed many, and you i have strengthened the weak hands."
Job,4,4,"You 1s words have upholden him that was falling, and you i have strengthened the feeble knees."
Job,4,5,"But now it is come upon you i , and you i faintest; it touches you i , and you i are troubled."
Job,4,6," [Is] not [this] your i fear, your i confidence, your i hope, and the uprightness of your i ways?"
Job,4,7,"Remember, I pray you i , who [ever] perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?"
Job,4,8,"Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same."
Job,4,9,"By the blast of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed."
Job,4,10,"The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken."
Job,4,11,"The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad."
Job,4,12,"Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a little thereof."
Job,4,13,"In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,"
Job,4,14,"Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake."
Job,4,15,Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
Job,4,16,"It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image [was] before my eyes, [there was] silence, and I heard a voice, [saying],"
Job,4,17,Shall mortal man be more just than God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
Job,4,18,"Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:"
Job,4,19,"How much less [in] them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation [is] in the dust, [which] are crushed before the moth?"
Job,4,20,They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish forever without any regarding [it].
Job,4,21,"Does not their excellency [which is] in them go away? they die, even without wisdom."
Job,5,1,"Call now, if there be any that will answer you i ; and to which of the saints will you i turn?"
Job,5,2,"For wrath kills the foolish man, and envy slays the silly one."
Job,5,3,I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
Job,5,4,"His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither [is there] any to deliver [them]."
Job,5,5,"Whose harvest the hungry eats up, and takes it even out of the thorns, and the robber swallow (to approve, commend, accept) s up their substance."
Job,5,6,"Although affliction comes not forth of the dust, neither does trouble spring out of the ground;"
Job,5,7,"Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward."
Job,5,8,"I would seek unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] would I commit my cause:"
Job,5,9,Which does great things and unsearchable; marvelous things without number:
Job,5,10,"Who gives rain upon the earth, and send waters upon the fields:"
Job,5,11,To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
Job,5,12,"He disappoints the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform [their] enterprise."
Job,5,13,He takes the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the perverse (twisted) [habitually disposed to disobedience and opposition] is carried headlong.
Job,5,14,"They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night."
Job,5,15,"But he saves the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty."
Job,5,16,"So the poor has hope, and iniquity stops her mouth."
Job,5,17,"Behold, happy [is] the man whom God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] corrects: therefore despise not you i the chastening of the Almighty:"
Job,5,18,"For he makes sore, and binds up: he wounds, and his hands make whole."
Job,5,19,"He shall deliver you i in six troubles: yes, in seven there shall no evil touch you i."
Job,5,20,In famine he shall redeem you i from death: and in war from the power of the sword.
Job,5,21,you i shall be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shall you i be afraid of destruction when it comes.
Job,5,22,At destruction and famine you i shall laugh: neither shall you i be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
Job,5,23,For you i shall be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you i.
Job,5,24,"And you i shall know that you i tabernacle [shall be] in peace; and you i shall visit you i habitation, and shall not sin."
Job,5,25,"you i shall know also that you i seed [shall be] great, and you i offspring as the grass of the earth."
Job,5,26,"you i shall come to [you i ] grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn comes in in his season."
Job,5,27,"Lo this, we have searched it, so it [is] ; hear it, and know you i [it] for you i good."
Job,6,1,"But Iyov [hated] answered and said,"
Job,6,2,"Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!"
Job,6,3,"For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallow (to approve, commend, accept) ed up."
Job,6,4,"For the arrows of the Almighty [are] within me, the poison whereof drink up my spirit: the terrors of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] do set themselves in array (to put on; to clothe) against me."
Job,6,5,Does the wild ass groan (wail; make a foul noise) when he has grass? or lows the ox over his fodder?
Job,6,6,Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there [any] taste in the white of an egg?
Job,6,7,The things [that] my soul refused to touch [are] as my sorrowful meat.
Job,6,8,Oh that I might have my request; and that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] would grant [me] the thing that I long for!
Job,6,9,"Even that it would please God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!"
Job,6,10,"Then should I yet have comfort; yes, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One."
Job,6,11,"What [is] my strength, that I should hope? and what [is] my end, that I should prolong my life?"
Job,6,12, [Is] my strength the strength of stones? or [is] my flesh of brass?
Job,6,13, [Is] not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
Job,6,14,To him that is afflicted pity [should be showed] from his friend; but he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
Job,6,15,"My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, [and] as the stream of brooks they pass away;"
Job,6,16,"Which are blackish by reason of the ice, [and] wherein the snow is hid:"
Job,6,17,"What time they grow (become; advance) warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place."
Job,6,18,"The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish."
Job,6,19,"The troops of Teima [desert] looked, the companies of Sheva [Seven] waited for them."
Job,6,20,"They were confounded because they had hoped; they came there, and were ashamed."
Job,6,21,"For now you 2f are nothing; you 2f see [my] casting down, and are afraid."
Job,6,22,"Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?"
Job,6,23,"Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?"
Job,6,24,"Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred."
Job,6,25,How forcible are right words! but what does your arguing reprove?
Job,6,26,"Do you 2f imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, [which are] as wind?"
Job,6,27,"Yes, you 2f overwhelm the fatherless, and you 2f dig [a pit] for your friend."
Job,6,28,"Now therefore be content, look upon me; for [it is] evident unto you if I lie."
Job,6,29,"Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yes, return again, my righteousness [is] in it."
Job,6,30,Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
Job,7,1, [Is there] not an appointed time to man upon earth? [are not] his days also like the days of an employee (hired laborer)?
Job,7,2,"As a servant earnestly desires the shadow, and as an employee (hired laborer) looks for [the reward of] his work:"
Job,7,3,"So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me."
Job,7,4,"When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day."
Job,7,5,"My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome."
Job,7,6,"My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope."
Job,7,7,O remember that my life [is] wind: my eye shall no more see good.
Job,7,8,"The eye of him that has seen me shall see me no [more] : you i eyes [are] upon me, and I [am] not."
Job,7,9, [As] the cloud is consumed and vanishes away: so he that goes down to the grave shall come up no [more].
Job,7,10,"He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him anymore."
Job,7,11,Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,7,12," [Am] I a sea, or a whale, that you i set a watch over me?"
Job,7,13,"When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;"
Job,7,14,"Then you i terrify me with dreams, and terrify me through visions:"
Job,7,15,"So that my soul chooses strangling, [and] death rather than my life."
Job,7,16,I loathe [it] ; I would not live always: let me alone; for my days [are] vanity.
Job,7,17,"What [is] man, that you i should magnify him? and that you i should set you i heart upon him?"
Job,7,18,"And [that] you i should visit him every morning, [and] try him every moment?"
Job,7,19,"How long will you i not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow (to approve, commend, accept) down my spittle?"
Job,7,20,"I have sinned; what shall I do unto you i , O you i preserver of men? why have you i set me as a mark against you i , so that I am a burden to myself?"
Job,7,21,"And why do you i not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and you i shall seek me in the morning, but I [shall] not [be]."
Job,8,1,"Then answered Bildad [confusing by mingling love] the Shuchi [wealth] , and said,"
Job,8,2,How long will you i speak these [things] ? and [how long shall] the words of you i mouth [be like] a strong wind?
Job,8,3,Does God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] pervert judgment? or does the Almighty pervert justice?
Job,8,4,"If you i children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;"
Job,8,5,"If you i would seek unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] early, and make you i supplication to the Almighty;"
Job,8,6,"If you i [were] pure and upright; surely now he would awake for you i , and make the habitation of you i righteousness prosperous."
Job,8,7,"Though you i beginning was small, yet you i latter end should greatly increase."
Job,8,8,"For enquire, I pray you i , of the former age, and prepare yourself to the search of their fathers:"
Job,8,9,"(For we [are but of] yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth [are] a shadow)"
Job,8,10,"Shall not they teach you i, [and] tell you i , and utter words out of their heart?"
Job,8,11,Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?
Job,8,12,"Whilst it [is] yet in his greenness, [and] not cut down, it withers before any [other] herb."
Job,8,13,So [are] the paths of all that forget God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; and the hypocrite’s hope shall perish:
Job,8,14,"Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust [shall be] a spider’s web."
Job,8,15,"He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure."
Job,8,16,"He [is] green before the sun, and his branch shoots forth in his garden."
Job,8,17,"His roots are wrapped about the heap, [and] sees the place of stones."
Job,8,18,"If he destroy him from his place, then [it] shall deny him, [saying] , I have not seen you i."
Job,8,19,"Behold, this [is] the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow."
Job,8,20,"Behold, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] will not cast away a perfect [man] , neither will he help the evil doers:"
Job,8,21,"Till he fill you i mouth with laughing, and you i lips with rejoicing."
Job,8,22,They that hate you i shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nothing.
Job,9,1,"Then Iyov [hated] answered and said,"
Job,9,2,I know [it is] so of a truth: but how should man be just with God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]?
Job,9,3,"If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand."
Job,9,4," [He is] wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who has hardened [himself] against him, and has prospered?"
Job,9,5,"Which removes the mountains, and they know not: which overturns them in his anger."
Job,9,6,"Which shakes the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble."
Job,9,7,"Which commands the sun, and it rises not; and seals up the stars."
Job,9,8,"Which alone spreads out the heavens, and treads upon the waves of the sea."
Job,9,9,"Which makes ‘Ash (Arcturus) [bear watcher] , Kesil (Orion) [The Fool] , and Kimah (Pleiades) [a cluster] , and the chambers of the south."
Job,9,10,"Which does great things past finding out; yes, and wonders without number."
Job,9,11,"Lo, he goes by me, and I see [him] not: he passes on also, but I perceive him not."
Job,9,12,"Behold, he takes away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What do you i?"
Job,9,13," [If] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him."
Job,9,14,"How much less shall I answer him, [and] choose out my words [to reason] with him?"
Job,9,15,"Whom, though I were righteous, [yet] would I not answer, [but] I would make supplication to my judge."
Job,9,16,"If I had called, and he had answered me; [yet] would I not believe that he had listened unto my voice."
Job,9,17,"For he breaks me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause."
Job,9,18,"He will not suffer me to take my breath, but fills me with bitterness."
Job,9,19,"If [I speak] of strength, lo, [he is] strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time [to plead]?"
Job,9,20,"If I justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: [if I say] , I [am] perfect, it shall also prove me perverse."
Job,9,21," [Though] I [were] perfect, [yet] would I not know my soul: I would despise my life."
Job,9,22,"This [is] one [thing] , therefore I said [it] , He destroys the perfect and the wicked."
Job,9,23,"If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent."
Job,9,24,"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covers the faces of the thereof; if not, where, [and] who [is] he?"
Job,9,25,"Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good."
Job,9,26,They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle [that] hastes to the prey.
Job,9,27,"If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort [myself]:"
Job,9,28,"I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that you i will not hold me innocent."
Job,9,29," [If] I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?"
Job,9,30,"If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;"
Job,9,31,"Yet shall you i plunge me in the ditch, and my own clothes shall abhor me."
Job,9,32,"For [he is] not a man, as I [am, that] I should answer him, [and] we should come together in judgment."
Job,9,33,"Neither is there any arbitrator between us, [that] might lay his hand upon us both."
Job,9,34,"Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:"
Job,9,35," [Then] would I speak, and not fear him; but [it is] not so with me."
Job,10,1,My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,10,2,"I will say unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , Do not condemn me; show me wherefore you i contend with me."
Job,10,3," [Is it] good unto you i that you i should oppress, that you i should despise the work of you i hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?"
Job,10,4,Have you i eyes of flesh? or see you i as man sees?
Job,10,5," [Are] you i days as the days of man? [are] you i years as man’s days,"
Job,10,6,"That you i enquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin?"
Job,10,7,you i know that I am not wicked; and [there is] none that can deliver out of you i hand.
Job,10,8,Your 1s hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet you i do destroy me.
Job,10,9,"Remember, I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , that you i have made me as the clay; and will you i bring me into dust again?"
Job,10,10,"Have you i not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?"
Job,10,11,"you i have clothed me with skin and flesh, and have fenced me with bones and sinews."
Job,10,12,"you i have granted me life and favour, and you i visitation has preserved my spirit."
Job,10,13,And these [things] have you i hid in you i heart: I know that this [is] with you i.
Job,10,14,"If I sin, then you i mark me, and you i will not acquit me from my iniquity."
Job,10,15,"If I be wicked, woe unto me; and [if] I be righteous, [yet] will I not lift up my head. [I am] full of confusion; therefore see you i my affliction;"
Job,10,16,For it increases. you i hunt me as a fierce lion: and again you i show yourself marvelous upon me.
Job,10,17,"you i renew your i witnesses against me, and increase your i indignation upon me; changes and war [are] against me."
Job,10,18,"For what reason then have you i brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!"
Job,10,19,I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
Job,10,20," [Are] not my days few? cease [then, and] let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,"
Job,10,21,"Before I go [from what place] I shall not return, [even] to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;"
Job,10,22,"A land of darkness, as darkness [itself; and] of the shadow of death, without any order, and [where] the light [is] as darkness."
Job,11,1,"Then answered Tzofar [sparrow] the Na’amti [pleasantness] , and said,"
Job,11,2,Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?
Job,11,3,"Should you i lies make men hold their peace? and when you i mock, shall no man make you i ashamed?"
Job,11,4,"For you i have said, My doctrine [is] pure, and I am clean in you i eyes."
Job,11,5,"But oh that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] would speak, and open his lips against you i;"
Job,11,6,"And that he would show you i the secrets of wisdom, that [they are] double to that which is! Know therefore that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] exacts of you i [less] than your i iniquity [deserves]."
Job,11,7,Can you i by searching find out God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ? can you i find out the Almighty’s limits?
Job,11,8, [It is] as high as heaven; what can you i do? deeper than hell; what can you i know?
Job,11,9,"The measure thereof [is] longer than the earth, and broader than the sea."
Job,11,10,"If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?"
Job,11,11,For he knows vain men: he sees wickedness also; will he not then consider [it]?
Job,11,12,"For vain man would be wise, though man be born [like] a wild ass’s colt."
Job,11,13,"If you i prepare you i heart, and stretch out you i hands toward him;"
Job,11,14,"If iniquity [be] in you i hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in you i tabernacles."
Job,11,15,"For then shall you i lift up you i face without spot; yes, you i shall be steadfast, and shall not fear:"
Job,11,16,"Because you i shall forget [you i ] misery, [and] remember [it] as waters [that] pass away:"
Job,11,17,"And [you i ] age shall be clearer than the noonday; you i shall shine forth, you i shall be as the morning."
Job,11,18,"And you i shall be secure, because there is hope; yes, you i shall dig [about you i , and] you i shall take you i rest in safety."
Job,11,19,"Also you i shall lie down, and none shall make [you i ] afraid; yes, many shall make suit unto you i."
Job,11,20,"But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope [shall be as] the giving up of the ghost."
Job,12,1,"And Iyov [hated] answered and said,"
Job,12,2,"No doubt but you 2f [are] the people, and wisdom shall die with you."
Job,12,3,"But I have understanding as well as you; I [am] not inferior to you: yes, who knows not such things as these?"
Job,12,4,"I am [as] one mocked of his neighbour, who calls upon God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and he answer him: the just upright [man is] laughed to scorn."
Job,12,5,He that is ready to slip with [his] feet [is as] a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
Job,12,6,"The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] are secure; into whose hand God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] brings [abundantly]."
Job,12,7,"But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach you i ; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell you i:"
Job,12,8,"Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach you i : and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto you i."
Job,12,9,Who knows not in all these that the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has wrought this?
Job,12,10,"In whose hand [is] the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind."
Job,12,11,Does not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?
Job,12,12,With the ancient [is] wisdom; and in length of days understanding.
Job,12,13,"With him [is] wisdom and strength, he has counsel and understanding."
Job,12,14,"Behold, he breaks down, and it cannot be built again: he shuts up a man, and there can be no opening."
Job,12,15,"Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up: also he send them out, and they overturn the earth."
Job,12,16,With him [is] strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver [are] his.
Job,12,17,"He leads counselors away spoiled, and makes the fools."
Job,12,18,"He looses the bond of kings, and put on their waist with a belt."
Job,12,19,"He leads princes away spoiled, and overthrows the mighty."
Job,12,20,"He removes away the speech of the trusty, and takes away the understanding of the aged."
Job,12,21,"He pours contempt upon princes, and weakens the strength of the mighty."
Job,12,22,"He discovers deep things out of darkness, and brings out to light the shadow of death."
Job,12,23,"He increases the nations, and destroys them: he enlarges the nations, and straitens them [again]."
Job,12,24,"He takes away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness [where there is] no way."
Job,12,25,"They grope in the dark without light, and he makes them to stagger like [a] drunken [man]."
Job,13,1,"Lo, my eye has seen all [this] , my ear has heard and understood it."
Job,13,2,"What you 2f know, [the same] do I know also: I [am] not inferior unto you."
Job,13,3,"Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Job,13,4,"But you 2f [are] forgers of lies, you 2f [are] all physicians of no value."
Job,13,5,O that you 2f would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.
Job,13,6,"Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips."
Job,13,7,Will you 2f speak wickedly for God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ? and talk deceitfully for him?
Job,13,8,Will you 2f accept his person? will you 2f contend for God-El [The Powerful Living Word]?
Job,13,9,"Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocks another, do you 2f [so] mock him?"
Job,13,10,"He will surely reprove you, if you 2f do secretly accept persons."
Job,13,11,Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
Job,13,12,"Your remembrances [are] like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay."
Job,13,13,"Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what [will]."
Job,13,14,"For what reason do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand?"
Job,13,15,"Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain my own ways before him."
Job,13,16,He also [shall be] my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.
Job,13,17,"Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears."

Job,13,19,"Who [is] he [that] will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost."
Job,13,20,Only do not two [things] unto me: then will I not hide myself from you i.
Job,13,21,Withdraw you i hand far from me: and let not you i dread make me afraid.
Job,13,22,"Then call you i , and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer you i me."
Job,13,23,How many [are] my iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
Job,13,24,"For what reason hide you i your i face, and hold me for you i enemy?"
Job,13,25,Will you i break a leaf driven to and fro? and will you i pursue the dry stubble?
Job,13,26,"For you i write bitter things against me, and makes me to possess the iniquities of my youth."
Job,13,27,"you i put my feet also in the stocks, and look narrowly unto all my paths; you i set a print upon the heels of my feet."

Job,14,4,Who can bring a clean [thing] out of an unclean? not one.
Job,14,5,"Seeing his days [are] determined, the number of his months [are] with you i , you i have appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;"
Job,14,6,"Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an employee (hired laborer) , his day."
Job,14,7,"For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease."
Job,14,8,"Though the root thereof grow (become; advance) old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;"
Job,14,9," [Yet] through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant."
Job,14,10,"But man dies, and wastes away: yes, man gives up the ghost, and where [is] he?"
Job,14,11," [As] the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decays and dries up:"
Job,14,12,"So man lies down, and rises not: till the heavens [be] no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep."
Job,14,13,"O that you i would hide me in the grave, that you i would keep me secret, until you i wrath be past, that you i would appoint me a set time, and remember me!"
Job,14,14,"If a man die, shall he live [again] ? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come."
Job,14,15,"you i shall call, and I will answer you i : you i will have a desire to the work of you i hands."
Job,14,16,For now you i my steps: do you i not watch over my sin?
Job,14,17,"My transgression [is] sealed up in a bag, and you i sews up my iniquity."
Job,14,18,"And surely the mountain falling comes to nothing, and the rock is removed out of his place."
Job,14,19,The waters wear the stones: you i washes away the things which grow [out] of the dust of the earth; and you i destroy the hope of man.
Job,14,20,"you i prevail forever against him, and he passes: you i change his Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor), and send him away."
Job,14,21,"His sons come to honour, and he knows [it] not; and they are brought low, but he perceives [it] not of them."
Job,14,22,"But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn."
Job,15,1,"Then answered Elifaz [my God is (fine) gold] the Temani [southward] , and said,"
Job,15,2,"Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?"
Job,15,3,Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches which he can do no good?
Job,15,4,"Yes, you i cast off fear, and restraints prayer before God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Job,15,5,"For your i mouth utters your i iniquity, and you i choose the tongue of the crafty."
Job,15,6,"Your 1s own mouth condemns you i , and not I: yes, your i own lips testify against you i."
Job,15,7, [Are] you i the first man [that] was born? or were you i made before the hills?
Job,15,8,Have you i heard the secret of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ? and do you i restrain wisdom to yourself?
Job,15,9,"What know you i , that we know not? [what] understand you i , which [is] not in us?"
Job,15,10,"With us [are] both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than you i father."
Job,15,11, [Are] the consolations of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] small with you i ? is there any secret thing with you i?
Job,15,12,"Why does you i heart carry you i away? and what do you i eyes wink at,"
Job,15,13,"That you i turn your i spirit against God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and let [such] words go out of your i mouth?"

Job,15,23,"He wanders abroad for bread, [saying] , Where [is it] ? he knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand."
Job,15,24,"Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle."

Job,15,26,"He runs upon him, [even] on [his] neck, upon the thick bosses (bump-like shapes on a shield) of his bucklers:"
Job,15,27,"Because he covers his face with his fatness, and makes blubber of fat on [his] flanks."
Job,15,28,"And he dwells in desolate cities, [and] in houses which no man inhabits, which are ready to become heaps."
Job,15,29,"He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth."
Job,15,30,"He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away."

Job,15,34,"For the congregation of hypocrites [shall be] desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery."
Job,15,35,"They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepares deceit."
Job,16,1,"Then Iyov [hated] answered and said,"
Job,16,2,I have heard many such things: miserable comforters [are] you 2f all.
Job,16,3,Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldens you i that you i answer?
Job,16,4,"I also could speak as you 2f [do] : if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake my head at you."
Job,16,5," [But] I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should assuage [your grief]."
Job,16,6,"Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and [though] I refrain (restrain; refrein from acting) , what am I eased?"
Job,16,7,But now he has made me weary: you i have made desolate all my company.
Job,16,8,"And you i have filled me with wrinkles, [which] is a witness [against me] : and my leanness rising up in me bears witness to my face."
Job,16,9,"He tears [me] in his wrath, who hates me: he gnashes upon me with his teeth; my enemy sharpens his eyes upon me."

Job,16,19,"Also now, behold, my witness [is] in heaven, and my record [is] on high."
Job,16,20,My friends scorn me: [but] my eye pours out [tears] unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered].

Job,17,3,"Lay down now, put me in a surety with you i ; who [is] he [that] will strike hands with me?"
Job,17,4,For you i have hid their heart from understanding: therefore shall you i not exalt [them].
Job,17,5,"He that speaks flattery to [his] friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail."

Job,18,2,"How long [will it be before] you 2f make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak."
Job,18,3,"For what reason are we counted as beasts, [and] reputed vile in your sight?"
Job,18,4,He tears himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for you i ? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?
Job,18,5,"Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine."
Job,18,6,"The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him."

Job,19,1,"Then Iyov [hated] answered and said,"
Job,19,2,"How long will you 2f vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?"
Job,19,3,These ten times have you 2f reproached me: you 2f are not ashamed [that] you 2f make yourselves strange to me.
Job,19,4,"And be it indeed [that] I have erred, my error remains with myself."
Job,19,5,"If indeed you 2f will magnify [yourselves] against me, and plead against me my reproach (disgrace; shame):"

Job,20,10,"His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods."
Job,20,11,"His bones are full [of the sin] of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust."
Job,20,12,"Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, [though] he hide it under his tongue;"
Job,20,13," [Though] he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:"
Job,20,14," [Yet] his meat in his bowels (inward parts; affections) is turned, [it is] the gall (something bitter or poisonous) of asps within him."
Job,20,15,"He has swallow (to approve, commend, accept)ed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shall cast them out of his belly."
Job,20,16,He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him.
Job,20,17,"He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter."
Job,20,18,"That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow (to approve, commend, accept) [it] down: according to [his] substance [shall] the restitution [be] , and he shall not rejoice [in it]."
Job,20,19,Because he has oppressed [and] has forsaken the poor; [because] he has violently taken away an house which he built not;
Job,20,20,"Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired."
Job,20,21,There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.
Job,20,22,In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.

Job,21,15,"What [is] the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?"
Job,21,16,"Lo, their good [is] not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me."
Job,21,17,How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and [how oft] comes their destruction upon them! [God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ] distributes sorrows in his anger.
Job,21,18,"They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carries away."

Job,22,15,Have you i marked the old way which wicked men have trampled?
Job,22,16,"Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:"
Job,22,17,"Which said unto God-El [The Powerful Living Word] , Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?"
Job,22,18,Yet he filled their houses with good [things] : but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job,22,19,"The righteous see [it] , and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn."

Job,23,4,"I would order [my] cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments."
Job,23,5,"I would know the words [which] he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me."
Job,23,6,Will he plead against me with [his] great power? No; but he would put [strength] in me.
Job,23,7,There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered forever from my judge.
Job,23,8,"Behold, I go forward, but he [is] not [there] ; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:"
Job,23,9,"On the left hand, where he does work, but I cannot behold [him] : he hides himself on the right hand, that I cannot see [him]:"
Job,23,10,"But he knows the way that I take: [when] he has tried me, I shall come forth as gold."
Job,23,11,"My foot has held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined."
Job,23,12,Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary [food].
Job,23,13,"But he [is] in one [mind] , and who can turn him? and [what] his soul desires, even [that] he does."
Job,23,14,For he performs [the thing that is] appointed for me: and many such [things are] with him.
Job,23,15,"Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him."
Job,23,16,"For God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] makes my heart soft, and the Almighty troubles me:"
Job,23,17,"Because I was not cut off before the darkness, [neither] has he covered the darkness from my face."

Job,24,2," [Some] remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed [thereof]."
Job,24,3,"They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge."
Job,24,4,They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
Job,24,5,"Behold, [as] wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising early for a prey: the wilderness [yields] food for them [and] for [their] children."

Job,24,19,Drought and heat consume the snow waters: [so does] the grave [those which] have sinned.
Job,24,20,The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
Job,24,21,He evil entreats the barren [that] bears not: and does not good to the widow.
Job,24,22,"He draws also the mighty with his power: he rises up, and no [man] is sure of life."
Job,24,23," [Though] it be given him [to be] in safety, whereon he rests; yet his eyes [are] upon their ways."
Job,24,24,"They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all [other] , and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn."
Job,24,25,"And if [it be] not [so] now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?"
Job,25,1,"Then answered Bildad [confusing by mingling love] the Shuchi [wealth] , and said,"
Job,25,2,"Dominion and fear [are] with him, he makes peace in his high places."
Job,25,3,Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom does not his light arise?
Job,25,4,How then can man be justified with God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ? or how can he be clean [that is] born of a woman?
Job,25,5,"Behold even to the moon, and it shines not; yes, the stars are not pure in his sight."
Job,25,6,"How much less man, [that is] a worm? and the Son of man, [which is] a worm?"
Job,26,1,"But Job answered and said,"
Job,26,2,How have you i helped [him that is] without power? [how] save you i the arm [that has] no strength?
Job,26,3,How have you i counseled [him that has] no wisdom? and [how] have you i plentifully declared the thing as it is?

Job,26,14,"Lo, these [are] parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?"
Job,27,1,"Moreover Iyov [hated] continued his parable, and said,"

Job,28,11,He binds the floods from overflowing; and [the thing that is] hid brings he forth to light.
Job,28,12,But where shall wisdom be found? and where [is] the place of understanding?
Job,28,13,Man knows not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.

Job,28,15,"It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed [for] the price thereof."

Job,30,1,"But now [they that are] younger than I have me in ridicule (laughing at enemies’ threats) , whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock."
Job,30,2,"Yes, whereto [might] the strength of their hands [profit] me, in whom old age was perished?"
Job,30,3,For lack and famine [they were] solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
Job,30,4,"Who cut up mallow (to approve, commend, accept) s by the bushes, and juniper roots [for] their meat."
Job,30,5,"They were driven forth from among [men] , (they cried after them as [after] a thief;)"
Job,30,6,"To dwell in the clefts of the valleys, [in] caves of the earth, and [in] the rocks."
Job,30,7,Among the bushes they groan (wail; make a foul noise) ed; under the nettles they were gathered together.
Job,30,8," [They were] children of fools, yes, children of base men: they were viler than the earth."
Job,30,9,"And now am I their song, yes, I am their byword."

Job,30,18,By the great force [of my disease] is my garment changed: it binds me about as the collar of my coat.
Job,30,19,"He has cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes."
Job,30,20,"I cry unto you i , and you i do not hear me: I stand up, and you i regard me [not]."
Job,30,21,you i are become cruel to me: with your i strong hand you i oppose yourself against me.
Job,30,22,"you i lift me up to the wind; you i cause me to ride [upon it] , and dissolve my substance."
Job,30,23,"For I know [that] you i will bring me [to] death, and [to] the house appointed for all living."
Job,30,24,"However he will not stretch out [his] hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction."
Job,30,25,Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was [not] my soul grieved for the poor?
Job,30,26,"When I looked for good, then evil came [unto me] : and when I waited for light, there came darkness."
Job,30,27,"My bowels (inward parts; affections) boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me."
Job,30,28,"I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, [and] I cried in the congregation."
Job,30,29,"I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls."
Job,30,30,"My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat."
Job,30,31,"My harp also is [turned] to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep."
Job,31,1,I made a covenant with my eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
Job,31,2,For what portion of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is there] from above? and [what] inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
Job,31,3, [Is] not destruction to the wicked? and a strange [punishment] to the workers of iniquity?
Job,31,4,"Does not he see my ways, and count all my steps?"
Job,31,5,"If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot has hasted to deceit;"
Job,31,6,"Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] may know my integrity."
Job,31,7,"If my step has turned out of the way, and my heart walked after my eyes, and if any blot has cleaved to my hands;"
Job,31,8," [Then] let me sow, and let another eat; yes, let my offspring be rooted out."
Job,31,9,"If my heart have been deceived by a woman, or [if] I have laid wait at my neighbour’s door;"
Job,31,10," [Then] let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her."
Job,31,11,"For this [is] an heinous crime; yes, it [is] an iniquity [to be punished by] the judges."
Job,31,12,"For it [is] a fire [that] consumes to destruction, and would root out all my increase."
Job,31,13,"If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;"
Job,31,14,"What then shall I do when God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] rises up? and when he visits, what shall I answer him?"
Job,31,15,Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
Job,31,16,"If I have withheld the poor from [their] desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;"
Job,31,17,"Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless has not eaten thereof;"
Job,31,18,"(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as [with] a father, and I have guided her from my mother’s womb;)"
Job,31,19,"If I have seen any perish for lack of clothing, or any poor without covering;"
Job,31,20,"If his waist have not Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) me, and [if] he were [not] warmed with the fleece of my sheep;"
Job,31,21,"If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:"
Job,31,22," [Then] let my arm fall from my shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from the bone."
Job,31,23,"For destruction [from] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [was] a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure."
Job,31,24,"If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, [you i are] my confidence;"
Job,31,25,"If I rejoiced because my wealth [was] great, and because my hand had gotten much;"
Job,31,26,"If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking [in] brightness;"
Job,31,27,"And my heart has been secretly enticed, or my mouth has kissed my hand:"
Job,31,28,This also [were] an iniquity [to be punished by] the judge: for I should have denied the God-El [The Powerful Living Word] [that is] above.
Job,31,29,"If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:"
Job,31,30,Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
Job,31,31,"If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied."
Job,31,32,The stranger did not lodge in the street: [but] I opened my doors to the traveller.
Job,31,33,"If I covered my transgressions as Adam (Man, ground; red; earthling), by hiding my iniquity in my bosom:"
Job,31,34,"Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, [and] went not out of the door?"
Job,31,35,"Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire [is, that] the Almighty would answer me, and [that] my adversary had written a book."
Job,31,36,"Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, [and] bind it [as] a crown to me."
Job,31,37,I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
Job,31,38,"If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;"
Job,31,39,"If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:"
Job,31,40,"Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle (a weed resembling wheat) instead of barley. The words of Iyov [hated] are ended."
Job,32,1,"So these three men ceased to answer Iyov [hated] , because he [was] righteous in his own eyes."
Job,32,2,"Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu [He is my God] the son of Barakh’el [God blesses] the Buzi [contempt] , of the family of Ram [high or exalted] : against Iyov [hated] was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Job,32,3,"Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and [yet] had condemned Iyov [hated]."
Job,32,4,"Now Elihu [He is my God] had waited till Iyov [hated] had spoken, because they [were] elder than he."
Job,32,5,"When Elihu [He is my God] saw that [there was] no answer in the mouth of [these] three men, then his wrath was kindled."
Job,32,6,"And Elihu [He is my God] the son of Barakh’el [God blesses] the Buzi [contempt] answered and said, I [am] young, and you 2f [are] very old; wherefore I was afraid, and dared (was bold enough) not show you my opinion."
Job,32,7,"I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom."
Job,32,8,But [there is] a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty gives them understanding.
Job,32,9,Great men are not [always] wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
Job,32,10,"Therefore I said, Listen to me; I also will show my opinion."
Job,32,11,"Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst you 2f searched out what to say."
Job,32,12,"Yes, I attended unto you, and, behold, [there was] none of you that convinced Iyov [hated], [or] that answered his words:"
Job,32,13,"Lest you 2f should say, We have found out wisdom: God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] thrusts him down, not man."
Job,32,14,Now he has not directed [his] words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.
Job,32,15,"They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking."
Job,32,16,"When I had waited, (for they spoke not, but stood still, [and] answered no more;)"
Job,32,17," [I said] , I will answer also my part, I also will show my opinion."
Job,32,18,"For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constrains me."
Job,32,19,"Behold, my belly [is] as wine [which] has no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles."
Job,32,20,"I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer."
Job,32,21,"Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man."
Job,32,22,For I know not to give flattering titles; [in so doing] my maker would soon take me away.
Job,33,1,"For what reason, Iyov [hated] , I pray you i , hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words."
Job,33,2,"Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue has spoken in my mouth."
Job,33,3,My words [shall be of] the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
Job,33,4,"The Spirit of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has made me, and the breath of the Almighty has given me life."
Job,33,5,"If you i can answer me, set [you i words] in order before me, stand up."
Job,33,6,"Behold, I [am] according to you i wish in God-El’s [The Powerful Living Word] stead: I also am formed out of the clay."
Job,33,7,"Behold, my terror shall not make you i afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon you i."
Job,33,8,"Surely you i have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of [you i ] words, [saying],"
Job,33,9,"I am clean without transgression, I [am] innocent; neither [is there] iniquity in me."
Job,33,10,"Behold, he finds occasions against me, he counts me for his enemy,"
Job,33,11,"He puts my feet in the stocks, he marks all my paths."
Job,33,12,"Behold, [in] this you i are not just: I will answer you i , that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] is greater than man."
Job,33,13,Why do you i strive against him? for he gives not account of any of his matters.
Job,33,14,"For God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] speaks once, yes twice, [yet man] perceives it not."
Job,33,15,"In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;"
Job,33,16,"Then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction,"
Job,33,17,"That he may withdraw man [from his] purpose, and hide pride from man."
Job,33,18,"He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword."
Job,33,19,"He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong [pain]:"
Job,33,20,"So that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty meat."
Job,33,21,"His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones [that] were not seen stick out."
Job,33,22,"Yes, his soul draws near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers."
Job,33,23,"If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show unto man his uprightness:"
Job,33,24,"Then he is gracious unto him, and says, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom."
Job,33,25,His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth:
Job,33,26,"He shall pray unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness."
Job,33,27,"He looks upon men, and [if any] say, I have sinned, and perverted [that which was] right, and it profited me not;"
Job,33,28,"He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light."
Job,33,29,"Lo, all these [things] works God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] oftentimes with man,"
Job,33,30,"To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living."
Job,33,31,"Mark well, O Iyov [hated] , hearken unto me: hold you i peace, and I will speak."
Job,33,32,"If you i have anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify you i."
Job,33,33,"If not, hearken unto me: hold you i peace, and I shall teach you i wisdom."
Job,34,1,"Furthermore Elihu [He is my God] answered and said,"
Job,34,2,"Hear my words, O you 2f wise [men] ; and give ear unto me, you 2f that have knowledge."
Job,34,3,"For the ear tries words, as the mouth tastes meat."
Job,34,4,Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what [is] good.
Job,34,5,"For Iyov [hated] has said, I am righteous: and God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has taken away my judgment."
Job,34,6,Should I lie against my right? my wound [is] incurable without transgression.
Job,34,7,"What man [is] like Iyov [hated], [who] drink up scorning like water?"
Job,34,8,"Which goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men."
Job,34,9,"For he has said, It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Job,34,10,"Therefore hearken unto me, you 2f men of understanding: far be it from God-El [The Powerful Living Word] [that he should do] wickedness; and [from] the Almighty, [that he should commit] iniquity."
Job,34,11,"For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to [his] ways."
Job,34,12,"Yes, surely God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment."
Job,34,13,Who has given him a charge over the earth? or who has disposed the whole world?
Job,34,14,"If he set his heart upon man, [if] he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;"
Job,34,15,"All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust."
Job,34,16,"If now [you i have] understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words."
Job,34,17,Shall even he that hates right govern? and will you i condemn him that is most just?
Job,34,18," [Is it fit] to say to a king, [you i are] wicked? [and] to princes, [You 2f are] ungodly?"
Job,34,19," [How much less to him] that accepts not the persons of princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor? for they all [are] the work of his hands."
Job,34,20,"In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand."
Job,34,21,"For his eyes [are] upon the ways of man, and he sees all his goings."
Job,34,22," [There is] no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves."
Job,34,23,For he will not lay upon man more [than right] ; that he should enter into judgment with God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered].
Job,34,24,"He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead."
Job,34,25,"Therefore he knows their works, and he overturns [them] in the night, so that they are destroyed."
Job,34,26,He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
Job,34,27,"Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:"
Job,34,28,"So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he hears the cry of the afflicted."
Job,34,29,"When he gives quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hides [his] face, who then can behold him? whether [it be done] against a nation, or against a man only:"
Job,34,30,"That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared."
Job,34,31,"Surely it is meet to be said unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , I have borne [chastisement] , I will not offend (make angry; make one stumble; violate) [any more]:"
Job,34,32," [That which] I see not teach you i me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more."
Job,34,33," [Should it be] according to you i mind? he will recompense it, whether you i refuse, or whether you i choose; and not I: therefore speak what you i know."
Job,34,34,"Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me."
Job,34,35,"Iyov [hated] has spoken without knowledge, and his words [were] without wisdom."
Job,34,36,My desire [is that] Iyov [hated] may be tried unto the end because of [his] answers for wicked men.
Job,34,37,"For he adds rebellion unto his sin, he claps [his hands] among us, and multiplies his words against God-El [The Powerful Living Word]."
Job,35,1,"Elihu [He is my God] spoke moreover, and said,"
Job,35,2,"Think you i this to be right, [that] you i said, My righteousness [is] more than God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ’s?"
Job,35,3,"For you i said, What advantage will it be unto you i? [and] , What profit shall I have, [if I be cleansed] from my sin?"
Job,35,4,"I will answer you i , and you i companions with you i."
Job,35,5,"Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds [which] are higher than you i."
Job,35,6,"If you i sin, what do you i against him? or [if] you i transgressions be multiplied, what do you i unto him?"
Job,35,7,"If you i be righteous, what give you i him? or what receives he of you i hand?"
Job,35,8,You 1s wickedness [may hurt] a man as you i [are] ; and you i righteousness [may profit] the Son of man.
Job,35,9,By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make [the oppressed] to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
Job,35,10,"But none says, Where [is] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] my maker, who gives songs in the night;"
Job,35,11,"Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth, and makes us wiser than the fowls of heaven?"
Job,35,12,"There they cry, but none gives answer, because of the pride of evil men."
Job,35,13,"Surely God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it."
Job,35,14,"Although you i say you i shall not see him, [yet] judgment [is] before him; therefore trust you i in him."
Job,35,15,"But now, because [it is] not [so] , he has visited in his anger; yet he knows [it] not in great extremity:"
Job,35,16,Therefore does Iyov [hated] open his mouth in vain; he multiplies words without knowledge.
Job,36,1,"Elihu [He is my God] also proceeded, and said,"
Job,36,2,"Suffer me a little, and I will show you i that [I have] yet to speak on God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ’s behalf."
Job,36,3,"I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker."
Job,36,4,For truly my words [shall] not [be] false: he that is perfect in knowledge [is] with you i.
Job,36,5,"Behold, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is] mighty, and despises not [any: he is] mighty in strength [and] wisdom."
Job,36,6,He preserves not the life of the wicked: but gives right to the poor.
Job,36,7,"He withdraws not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings [are they] on the throne; yes, he does establish them forever, and they are exalted."
Job,36,8,"And if [they be] bound in fetters, [and] be held in cords of affliction;"
Job,36,9,"Then he shows them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded."
Job,36,10,"He opens also their ear to discipline, and commands that they return from iniquity."
Job,36,11,"If they obey and serve [him] , they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures."
Job,36,12,"But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge."
Job,36,13,But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he binds them.
Job,36,14,"They die in youth, and their life [is] among the unclean."
Job,36,15,"He delivers the poor in his affliction, and opens their ears in oppression."
Job,36,16,"Even so would he have removed you i out of the strait [into] a broad place, where [there is] no straitness; and that which should be set on you i table [should be] full of fatness."
Job,36,17,But you i have fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold [on you i ].
Job,36,18,"Because [there is] wrath, [beware] lest he take you i away with [his] stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver you i."
Job,36,19,"Will he esteem you i riches? [no] , not gold, nor all the forces of strength."
Job,36,20,"Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place."
Job,36,21,"Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this have you i chosen rather than affliction."
Job,36,22,"Behold, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] exalts by his power: who teaches like him?"
Job,36,23,"Who has enjoined him his way? or who can say, you i have wrought iniquity?"
Job,36,24,"Remember that you i magnify his work, which men behold."
Job,36,25,Every man may see it; man may behold [it] afar off.
Job,36,26,"Behold, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is] great, and we know [him] not, neither can the number of his years be searched out."
Job,36,27,For he makes small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
Job,36,28,Which the clouds do drop [and] distil upon man abundantly.
Job,36,29,"Also can [any] understand the spreadings of the clouds, [or] the noise of his tabernacle?"
Job,36,30,"Behold, he spreads his light upon it, and covers the bottom of the sea."
Job,36,31,For by them he the people; he gives meat in abundance.
Job,36,32,With clouds he covers the light; and commands it [not to shine] by [the cloud] that comes between.
Job,36,33,"The noise thereof shows concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour."
Job,37,1,"At this also my heart trembles, and is moved out of his place."
Job,37,2,"Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound [that] goes out of his mouth."
Job,37,3,"He directs it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth."
Job,37,4,After it a voice roars: he thunders with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
Job,37,5,"God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] thunders marvelously with his voice; great things does he, which we cannot comprehend."
Job,37,6,"For he says to the snow, Be you i [on] the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength."
Job,37,7,He seals up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.
Job,37,8,"Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places."
Job,37,9,Out of the south comes the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.
Job,37,10,"By the breath of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened (impeded or restricted; narrowed, distressed)."
Job,37,11,Also by watering he wears the thick cloud: he scatters his bright cloud:
Job,37,12,And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commands them upon the face of the world in the earth.
Job,37,13,"He causes it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy."
Job,37,14,"Listen unto this, O Iyov [hated] : stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Job,37,15,"Do you i know when God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?"
Job,37,16,"Do you i know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?"
Job,37,17,"How you i garments [are] warm, when he quiets the earth by the south [wind]?"
Job,37,18,"Have you i with him spread out the sky, [which is] strong, [and] as a molten looking glass?"
Job,37,19,Teach us what we shall say unto him; [for] we cannot order [our speech] by reason of darkness.
Job,37,20,"Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallow (to approve, commend, accept) ed up."
Job,37,21,"And now [men] see not the bright light which [is] in the clouds: but the wind passes, and cleanses them."
Job,37,22,Fair weather comes out of the north: with God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is] terrible majesty.
Job,37,23," [Touching] the Almighty, we cannot find him out: [he is] excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict."
Job,37,24,Men do therefore fear him: he respects not any [that are] wise of heart.
Job,38,1,"Then the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) answered Iyov [hated] out of the whirlwind, and said,"
Job,38,2,Who [is] this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?
Job,38,3,"Gird up now you i waist like a man; for I will demand of you i , and answer you i me."
Job,38,4,"Where were you i when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if you i have understanding."
Job,38,5,"Who has laid the measures thereof, if you i know? or who has stretched the line upon it?"
Job,38,6,Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;
Job,38,7,"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shouted for joy?"
Job,38,8,"Or [who] shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth, [as if] it had issued out of the womb?"
Job,38,9,"When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddling clothes (cloths for wrapping infants tightly) for it,"
Job,38,10,"And broke up for it my decreed [place] , and set bars and doors,"
Job,38,11,"And said, Till this point in time shall you i come, but no further: and here shall you i proud waves be detained (held)?"
Job,38,12,Have you i commanded the morning since you i days; [and] caused the Dayspring (sunrise) to know his place;
Job,38,13,"That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?"
Job,38,14,It is turned as clay [to] the seal; and they stand as a garment.
Job,38,15,"And from the wicked their light is withheld, and the high arm shall be broken."
Job,38,16,Have you i entered into the springs of the sea? or have you i walked in the search of the depth?
Job,38,17,Have the gates of death been opened unto you i ? or have you i seen the doors of the shadow of death?
Job,38,18,Have you i perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if you i know it all.
Job,38,19,"Where [is] the way [where] light dwells? and [as for] darkness, where [is] the place thereof,"
Job,38,20,"That you i should take it to the bound thereof, and that you i should know the paths [to] the house thereof?"

Job,41,31,He makes the deep to boil like a pot: he makes the sea like a pot of ointment.

Job,42,5,I have heard of you i by the hearing of the ear: but now my eye sees you i.
Job,42,6,"For what reason I abhor [myself] , and repent in dust and ashes."
Job,42,7,"And it was [so] , that after the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had spoken these words unto Iyov [hated] , the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said to Elifaz [my God is (fine) gold] the Temani [southward] , My wrath is kindled against you i , and against you i two friends: for you 2f have not spoken of me [the thing that is] right, as my servant Iyov [hated] [has]."
Job,42,8,"Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Iyov [hated] , and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Iyov [hated] shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you [after your] folly, in that you 2f have not spoken of me [the thing which is] right, like my servant Iyov [hated]."
Job,42,9,"So Elifaz [my God is (fine) gold] the Temani [southward] and Bildad [confusing by mingling love] the Shuchi [wealth] [and] Tzofar [sparrow] the Na’amti [pleasantness] went, and did according as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded them: the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) also accepted Iyov [hated]."
Job,42,10,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) turned the captivity of Iyov [hated] , when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) gave Iyov [hated] twice as much as he had before."
Job,42,11,"Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold."
Job,42,12,"So the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) the latter end of Iyov [hated] more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses."
Job,42,13,He had also seven sons and three daughters.
Job,42,14,"And he called the name of the first, Y’mimah [day by day] ; and the name of the second, K’tzi’ah [cassia] ; and the name of the third, Keren-Hapukh [horn of the antimony]."
Job,42,15,And in all the land were no women found [so] fair as the daughters of Iyov [hated] : and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
Job,42,16,"After this lived Iyov [hated] an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, [even] four generations."
Job,42,17,"So Iyov [hated] died, [being] old and full of days."
