1 Samuel,1,1,"Now there was a certain man of Ramatayim-Tzofim [double height of the watchers] , of mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , and his name [was] Elkanah [God Has Taken Possession] , the son of Yerocham [showing pity] , the son of Elihu [He is my God] , the son of Tochu [lowly] , the son of Tzuf [honeycomb] , an Efrat [ashiness: fruitfulness]:"
1 Samuel,1,2,"And he had two wives; the name of the one [was] Hannah [grace] , and the name of the other P’ninah [jewel] : and P’ninah [jewel] had children, but Hannah [grace] had no children."
1 Samuel,1,3,"And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] in Shiloh [Place of Rest] . And the two sons of ‘Eli [ascension] , Hofni [fighter] and Pinchas [mouth of brass] , the priests of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [were] there."
1 Samuel,1,4,"And when the time was that Elkanah [God Has Taken Possession] offered, he gave to P’ninah [jewel] his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:"
1 Samuel,1,5,But unto Hannah [grace] he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah [grace] : but the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had shut up her womb.
1 Samuel,1,6,"And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her be troubled (be grieved; be displeased) , because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had shut up her womb."
1 Samuel,1,7,"And [as] he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat."
1 Samuel,1,8,"Then said Elkanah [God Has Taken Possession] her husband to her, Hannah [grace] , why weep you i ? and why eat you i not? and why is you i heart grieved? [am] not I better to you i than ten sons?"
1 Samuel,1,9,"So Hannah [grace] rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh [Place of Rest] , and after they had drunk. Now ‘Eli [ascension] the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,1,10,"And she [was] in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and wept sore."
1 Samuel,1,11,"And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , if you i will indeed look on the affliction of you i female servant, and remember me, and not forget you i female servant, but will give unto you i female servant a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head."
1 Samuel,1,12,"And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that ‘Eli [ascension] marked her mouth."
1 Samuel,1,13,"Now Hannah [grace] , she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore ‘Eli [ascension] thought she had been drunken."
1 Samuel,1,14,"And ‘Eli [ascension] said unto her, How long will you i be drunken? put away you i wine from you i."
1 Samuel,1,15,"And Hannah [grace] answered and said, No, my lord, I [am] a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,1,16,"Count not you i female servant for a daughter of Belial [Worthless, Good for Nothing] : for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken up to this time."
1 Samuel,1,17,"Then ‘Eli [ascension] answered and said, Go in peace: and the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] grant [you i ] you i petition that you i have asked of him."
1 Samuel,1,18,"And she said, Let your i female servant find grace in your i sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor) was no more [sad]."
1 Samuel,1,19,"And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and returned, and came to their house to Ramah [Hill] : and Elkanah [God Has Taken Possession] knew Hannah [grace] his wife; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) remembered her."
1 Samuel,1,20,"For what reason it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah [grace] had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Sh’mu’el [His name is El], [saying] , Because I have asked him of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,1,21,"And the man Elkanah [God Has Taken Possession] , and all his house, went up to offer unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) the yearly sacrifice, and his vow."
1 Samuel,1,22,"But Hannah [grace] went not up; for she said unto her husband, [I will not go up] until the child be weaned, and [then] I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and there abide forever."
1 Samuel,1,23,"And Elkanah [God Has Taken Possession] her husband said unto her, Do what seems you i good; wait until you i have weaned him; only the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him."
1 Samuel,1,24,"And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one eifah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in Shiloh [Place of Rest] : and the child [was] young."
1 Samuel,1,25,"And they killed a bullock, and brought the child to ‘Eli [ascension]."
1 Samuel,1,26,"And she said, Oh my lord, [as] you i soul lives, my lord, I [am] the woman that stood by you i here, praying unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,1,27,For this child I prayed; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has given me my petition which I asked of him:
1 Samuel,1,28,Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . And he worshipped the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) there.
1 Samuel,2,1,"And Hannah [grace] prayed, and said, My heart rejoices in the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , my horn is exalted in the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : my mouth is enlarged over my enemies; because I rejoice in you i salvation."
1 Samuel,2,2, [There is] none holy as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : for [there is] none beside you i : neither [is there] any rock like our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered].
1 Samuel,2,3,"Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let [not] arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] a God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed."
1 Samuel,2,4,"The bows of the mighty men [are] broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength."
1 Samuel,2,5, [They that were] full have hired out themselves for bread; and [they that were] hungry ceased: so that the barren has born seven; and she that has many children is waxed feeble.
1 Samuel,2,6,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) kills, and makes alive: he brings down to the grave, and brings up."
1 Samuel,2,7,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) makes poor, and makes rich: he brings low, and lifts up."
1 Samuel,2,8,"He raises up the poor out of the dust, [and] lifts up the beggar from the dunghill, to set [them] among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth [are] the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] , and he has set the world upon them."
1 Samuel,2,9,"He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail."
1 Samuel,2,10,"The adversaries of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed."
1 Samuel,2,11,And Elkanah [God Has Taken Possession] went to Ramah [Hill] to his house. And the child did minister unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) before ‘Eli [ascension] the priest.
1 Samuel,2,12,"Now the sons of ‘Eli [ascension] [were] sons of Belial [Worthless, Good for Nothing] ; they knew not the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,2,13,"And the priests’ custom with the people [was, that] , when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;"
1 Samuel,2,14,"And he struck [it] into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh [Place of Rest] unto all the Yisra’eli’s that came there."
1 Samuel,2,15,"Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have coocked (boiled) flesh of you i , but raw."
1 Samuel,2,16,"And [if] any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and [then] take [as much] as your i soul desires; then he would answer him, [No] ; but you i shall give [it me] now: and if not, I will take [it] by force."
1 Samuel,2,17,For what reason the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : for men abhorred the offering of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
1 Samuel,2,18,"But Sh’mu’el [His name is El] ministered before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [being] a child, girded with a linen ephod (vest)."
1 Samuel,2,19,"Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought [it] to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice."
1 Samuel,2,20,"And ‘Eli [ascension] Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) Elkanah [God Has Taken Possession] and his wife, and said, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) give you i seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . And they went unto their own home."
1 Samuel,2,21,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) visited Hannah [grace] , so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Sh’mu’el [His name is El] grew before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,2,22,"Now ‘Eli [ascension] was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and how they lay with the women that assembled [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation."
1 Samuel,2,23,"And he said unto them, Why do you 2f such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people."
1 Samuel,2,24,"No, my sons; for [it is] no good report that I hear: you 2f make the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] people to transgress."
1 Samuel,2,25,"If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , who shall entreat for him? Yet they listened not unto the voice of their father, because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) would slay them."
1 Samuel,2,26,"And the child Sh’mu’el [His name is El] grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and also with men."
1 Samuel,2,27,"And there came a man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] unto ‘Eli [ascension] , and said unto him, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Did I plainly appear unto the house of you i father, when they were in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] in Par’oh’s [Pharaoh - Great House] house?"
1 Samuel,2,28,"And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [to be] my priest, to offer upon my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod (vest) before me? and did I give unto the house of you i father all the offerings made by fire of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
1 Samuel,2,29,"For what reason kick you 2f at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded [in my] habitation; and honour you i sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the most important of all the offerings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] my people?"
1 Samuel,2,30,"For what reason the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] says, I said indeed [that] you i house, and the house of you i father, should walk before me forever: but now the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) says, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed."
1 Samuel,2,31,"Behold, the days come, that I will cut off you i arm, and the arm of you i father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in you i house."
1 Samuel,2,32,"And you i shall see an enemy [in my] habitation, in all [the wealth] which [God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]] shall give Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and there shall not be an old man in you i house forever."
1 Samuel,2,33,"And the man of you i, [whom] I shall not cut off from my altar, [shall be] to consume you i eyes, and to grieve you i heart: and all the increase of you i house shall die in the flower of their age."
1 Samuel,2,34,"And this [shall be] a sign unto you i , that shall come upon your i two sons, on Hofni [fighter] and Pinchas [mouth of brass] ; in one day they shall die both of them."
1 Samuel,2,35,"And I will raise me up a faithful priest, [that] shall do according to [that] which [is] in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed forever."
1 Samuel,2,36,"And it shall come to pass, [that] everyone that is left in you i house shall come [and] crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray you i , into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread."
1 Samuel,3,1,And the child Sh’mu’el [His name is El] ministered unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) before ‘Eli [ascension] . And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was precious in those days; [there was] no open vision.
1 Samuel,3,2,"And it came to pass at that time, when ‘Eli [ascension] [was] laid down in his place, and his eyes began to grow (become; advance) dim, [that] he could not see;"
1 Samuel,3,3,"And before the lamp of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] went out in the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , where the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [was] , and Sh’mu’el [His name is El] was laid down [to sleep];"
1 Samuel,3,4,"That the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) called Sh’mu’el [His name is El] : and he answered, Here [am] I."
1 Samuel,3,5,"And he ran unto ‘Eli [ascension] , and said, Here [am] I; for you i called me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down."
1 Samuel,3,6,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) called yet again, Sh’mu’el [His name is El] . And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] arose and went to ‘Eli [ascension] , and said, Here [am] I; for you i did call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again."
1 Samuel,3,7,"Now Sh’mu’el [His name is El] did not yet know the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , neither was the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) yet revealed unto him."
1 Samuel,3,8,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) called Sh’mu’el [His name is El] again the third time. And he arose and went to ‘Eli [ascension] , and said, Here [am] I; for you i did call me. And ‘Eli [ascension] perceived that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had called the child."
1 Samuel,3,9,"Therefore ‘Eli [ascension] said unto Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call you i , that you i shall say, Speak, Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; for you i servant hears. So Sh’mu’el [His name is El] went and lay down in his place."
1 Samuel,3,10,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came, and stood, and called as at other times, Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , Sh’mu’el [His name is El] . Then Sh’mu’el [His name is El] answered, Speak; for you i servant hears."
1 Samuel,3,11,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said to Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , Behold, I will do a thing in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , at which both the ears of everyone that hears it shall tingle."
1 Samuel,3,12,"In that day I will perform against ‘Eli [ascension] all [things] which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end."
1 Samuel,3,13,"For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knows; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not."
1 Samuel,3,14,"And therefore I have sworn unto the house of ‘Eli [ascension] , that the iniquity of ‘Eli [ascension] ’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering forever."
1 Samuel,3,15,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] feared to show ‘Eli [ascension] the vision."
1 Samuel,3,16,"Then ‘Eli [ascension] called Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , and said, Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , my son. And he answered, Here [am] I."
1 Samuel,3,17,"And he said, What [is] the thing that [the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)] has said unto you i ? I pray you i hide [it] not from me: God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] do so to you i , and more also, if you i hide [any] thing from me of all the things that he said unto you i."
1 Samuel,3,18,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It [is] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : let him do what seems him good."
1 Samuel,3,19,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] grew, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was with him, and did let none of his words fall to (to do entirely, do wholly) the ground."
1 Samuel,3,20,And all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] from Dan [Judge] even to Be’er-sheva [Well of the sevenfold Oath] knew that Sh’mu’el [His name is El] [was] established [to be] a prophet of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
1 Samuel,3,21,And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) appeared again in Shiloh [Place of Rest] : for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) revealed himself to Sh’mu’el [His name is El] in Shiloh [Place of Rest] by the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
1 Samuel,4,1,"And the word of Sh’mu’el [His name is El] came to all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] . Now Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went out against the P’lishtim [Immigrants] to battle, and pitched beside Even-’’Ezer [treasure] [stone of help] : and the P’lishtim [Immigrants] pitched in Aphek [Enclosure]."
1 Samuel,4,2,"And the P’lishtim [Immigrants] put themselves in array (to put on; to clothe) against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and when they joined battle, Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] was smitten before the P’lishtim [Immigrants] : and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men."
1 Samuel,4,3,"And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said, For what reason has the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) smitten us to day before the P’lishtim [Immigrants] ? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) out of Shiloh [Place of Rest] unto us, that, when it comes among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies."
1 Samuel,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh [Place of Rest] , that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , which dwells [between] the k’vurim (cherubim) : and the two sons of ‘Eli [ascension] , Hofni [fighter] and Pinchas [mouth of brass], [were] there with the ark of the covenant of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
1 Samuel,4,5,"And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came into the camp, all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again."
1 Samuel,4,6,"And when the P’lishtim [Immigrants] heard the noise of the shout, they said, What [means] the noise of this great shout in the camp of the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] ? And they understood that the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was come into the camp."
1 Samuel,4,7,"And the P’lishtim [Immigrants] were afraid, for they said, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there has not been such a thing heretofore."
1 Samuel,4,8,Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these [are] the Gods that struck the Mitzri with all the plagues in the wilderness.
1 Samuel,4,9,"Be strong, and quit (acquitted; found not guilty) yourselves like men, O you 2f P’lishtim [Immigrants] , that you 2f be not servants unto the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] , as they have been to you: quit (acquitted; found not guilty) yourselves like men, and fight."
1 Samuel,4,10,"And the P’lishtim [Immigrants] fought, and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] thirty thousand footmen."
1 Samuel,4,11,"And the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was taken; and the two sons of ‘Eli [ascension] , Hofni [fighter] and Pinchas [mouth of brass] , were slain."
1 Samuel,4,12,"And there ran a man of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] out of the army, and came to Shiloh [Place of Rest] the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head."
1 Samuel,4,13,"And when he came, lo, ‘Eli [ascension] sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] . And when the man came into the city, and told [it] , all the city cried out."
1 Samuel,4,14,"And when ‘Eli [ascension] heard the noise of the crying, he said, What [means] the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told ‘Eli [ascension]."
1 Samuel,4,15,"Now ‘Eli [ascension] was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see."
1 Samuel,4,16,"And the man said unto ‘Eli [ascension] , I [am] he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?"
1 Samuel,4,17,"And the messenger answered and said, Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] is fled before the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and you i two sons also, Hofni [fighter] and Pinchas [mouth of brass] , are dead, and the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] is taken."
1 Samuel,4,18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] forty years."
1 Samuel,4,19,"And his daughter in law, Pinchas [mouth of brass] ’ wife, was with child, [near] to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her."
1 Samuel,4,20,"And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for you i have born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard [it]."
1 Samuel,4,21,"And she named the child I-Khavod, saying, The glory is departed from Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : because the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband."
1 Samuel,4,22,"And she said, The glory is departed from Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : for the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] is taken."
1 Samuel,5,1,"And the P’lishtim [Immigrants] took the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and brought it from Even-’’Ezer [treasure] [stone of help] unto Ashdod [powerful]."
1 Samuel,5,2,"When the P’lishtim [Immigrants] took the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon."
1 Samuel,5,3,"And when they of Ashdod [powerful] arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon [was] fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again."
1 Samuel,5,4,"And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon [was] fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands [were] cut off upon the threshold; only [the stump of] Dagon was left to him."
1 Samuel,5,5,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, trample on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod [powerful] unto this day."
1 Samuel,5,6,"But the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was heavy upon them of Ashdod [powerful] , and he destroyed them, and struck them with hemorrhoids, [even] Ashdod [powerful] and the coasts thereof."
1 Samuel,5,7,"And when the men of Ashdod [powerful] saw that [it was] so, they said, The ark of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god."
1 Samuel,5,8,"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ? And they answered, Let the ark of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] be carried about unto Gat [Winepress] . And they carried the ark of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] about [there]."
1 Samuel,5,9,"And it was [so] , that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was against the city with a very great destruction: and he struck the men of the city, both small and great, and they had hemorrhoids in their secret parts."
1 Samuel,5,10,"Therefore they sent the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] to ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots] . And it came to pass, as the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] came to ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots] , that the ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots] cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to us, to slay us and our people."
1 Samuel,5,11,"So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and said, Send away the ark of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was very heavy there."
1 Samuel,5,12,And the men that died not were smitten with the hemorrhoids: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1 Samuel,6,1,And the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was in the country of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] seven months.
1 Samuel,6,2,"And the P’lishtim [Immigrants] called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ? tell us which we shall send it to his place."
1 Samuel,6,3,"And they said, If you 2f send away the ark of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then you 2f shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you."
1 Samuel,6,4,"Then said they, What [shall be] the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden hemorrhoids, and five golden mice, [according to] the number of the lords of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] : for one plague [was] on you all, and on your lords."
1 Samuel,6,5,"For what reason you 2f shall make images of your hemorrhoids, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you 2f shall give glory unto the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land."
1 Samuel,6,6,"For what reason then do you 2f harden your hearts, as the Mitzri and Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?"
1 Samuel,6,7,"Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milk cattle, on which there has come no yoke, and tie the cattle to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:"
1 Samuel,6,8,"And take the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which you 2f return him [for] a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go."
1 Samuel,6,9,"And see, if it goes up by the way of his own coast to Beit-Shemesh [House of the Sun], [then] he has done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that [it is] not his hand [that] struck us: it [was] a chance [that] happened to us."
1 Samuel,6,10,"And the men did so; and took two milk cattle, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:"
1 Samuel,6,11,"And they laid the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their hemorrhoids."
1 Samuel,6,12,"And the cattle took the straight way to the way of Beit-Shemesh [House of the Sun], [and] went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside [to] the right hand or [to] the left; and the lords of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] went after them unto the border of Beit-Shemesh [House of the Sun]."
1 Samuel,6,13,"And [they of] Beit-Shemesh [House of the Sun] [were] reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see [it]."
1 Samuel,6,14,"And the cart came into the field of Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , a Beit-Shimshi [house of the sun] , and stood there, where [there was] a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the cattle a burnt offering unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,6,15,"And the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] took down the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the coffer that [was] with it, wherein the jewels of gold [were] , and put [them] on the great stone: and the men of Beit-Shemesh [House of the Sun] offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,6,16,"And when the five lords of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] had seen [it] , they returned to ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots] the same day."
1 Samuel,6,17,"And these [are] the golden hemorrhoids which the P’lishtim [Immigrants] returned [for] a trespass offering unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; for Ashdod [powerful] one, for ‘Azah [The Strong] one, for Askelon [The Fire of Infamy: I shall be Weighed] one, for Gat [Winepress] one, for ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots] one;"
1 Samuel,6,18,"And the golden mice, [according to] the number of all the cities of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] [belonging] to the five lords, [both] of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great [stone of] Hevel (herdsman) , whereon they set down the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate): [which stone remains] unto this day in the field of Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , the Beit-Shimshi [house of the sun]."
1 Samuel,6,19,"And he struck the men of Beit-Shemesh [House of the Sun] , because they had looked into the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , even he struck of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had smitten [many] of the people with a great slaughter."
1 Samuel,6,20,"And the men of Beit-Shemesh [House of the Sun] said, Who is able to stand before this holy Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ? and to whom shall he go up from us?"
1 Samuel,6,21,"And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiryat-Ye’arim [City of Forests] , saying, The P’lishtim [Immigrants] have brought again the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; come you 2f down, [and] fetch it up to you."
1 Samuel,7,1,"And the men of Kiryat-Ye’arim [City of Forests] came, and fetched up the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and brought it into the house of Avinadav [my father is noble] in the hill, and sanctified El’azar [God has helped] his son to keep the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,7,2,"And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kiryat-Ye’arim [City of Forests] , that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] lamented after the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,7,3,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] spoke unto all the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, If you 2f do return unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) with all your hearts, [then] put away the strange gods and ‘Ashtarot [Star (female deity)] from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."
1 Samuel,7,4,"Then the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did put away Ba’alim [lords (false gods)] and ‘Ashtarot [Star (female deity)] , and served the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) only."
1 Samuel,7,5,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said, Gather all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to Mitzpah [Watchtower] , and I will pray for you unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,7,6,"And they gathered together to Mitzpah [Watchtower] , and drew water, and poured [it] out before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] judged the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in Mitzpah [Watchtower]."
1 Samuel,7,7,"And when the P’lishtim [Immigrants] heard that the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were gathered together to Mitzpah [Watchtower] , the lords of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] went up against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] . And when the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] heard [it] , they were afraid of the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."
1 Samuel,7,8,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said to Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , Cease not to cry unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."
1 Samuel,7,9,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] took a sucking lamb, and offered [it for] a burnt offering wholly unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and Sh’mu’el [His name is El] cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) for Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) heard him."
1 Samuel,7,10,"And as Sh’mu’el [His name is El] was offering up the burnt offering, the P’lishtim [Immigrants] drew near to battle against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : but the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and scattered (defeated in battle) them; and they were smitten before Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Samuel,7,11,"And the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went out of Mitzpah [Watchtower] , and pursued the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and struck them, until [they came] under Beit-Kar [house of the ram]."
1 Samuel,7,12,"Then Sh’mu’el [His name is El] took a stone, and set [it] between Mitzpah [Watchtower] and Shen [crag] , and called the name of it Even-’’Ezer [treasure] [stone of help] , saying, Until now has the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) helped us."
1 Samuel,7,13,"So the P’lishtim [Immigrants] were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was against the P’lishtim [Immigrants] all the days of Sh’mu’el [His name is El]."
1 Samuel,7,14,"And the cities which the P’lishtim [Immigrants] had taken from Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were restored to Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , from ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots] even unto Gat [Winepress] ; and the coasts thereof did Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] deliver out of the hands of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] . And there was peace between Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and the Emori [Highlanders]."
1 Samuel,7,15,And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] judged Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] all the days of his life.
1 Samuel,7,16,"And he went from year to year in circuit to Beit-El [House of God] , and Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] , and Mitzpah [Watchtower] , and judged Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in all those places."
1 Samuel,7,17,And his return [was] to Ramah [Hill] ; for there [was] his house; and there he judged Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and there he built an altar unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
1 Samuel,8,1,"And it came to pass, when Sh’mu’el [His name is El] was old, that he made his sons over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Samuel,8,2,"Now the name of his firstborn was Yo’el [Yehovah is God] ; and the name of his second, Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father]: [they were] in Be’er-sheva [Well of the sevenfold Oath]."
1 Samuel,8,3,"And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after profit, and took bribes, and perverted judgment."
1 Samuel,8,4,"Then all the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] gathered themselves together, and came to Sh’mu’el [His name is El] unto Ramah [Hill],"
1 Samuel,8,5,"And said unto him, Behold, you i are old, and your i sons walk not in your i ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations."
1 Samuel,8,6,"But the thing displeased Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] prayed unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,8,7,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , Listen unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto you i : for they have not rejected you i , but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them."
1 Samuel,8,8,"According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] even unto this day, which they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto you i."
1 Samuel,8,9,"Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them."
1 Samuel,8,10,And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] told all the words of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto the people that asked of him a king.
1 Samuel,8,11,"And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint [them] for himself, for his chariots, and [to be] his horsemen; and [some] shall run before his chariots."
1 Samuel,8,12,"And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and [will set them] to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots."
1 Samuel,8,13,"And he will take your daughters [to be] confectionaries (perfume/oiintment makeers; perfumers) , and [to be] cooks, and [to be] bakers."
1 Samuel,8,14,"And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive yards, [even] the best [of them] , and give [them] to his servants."
1 Samuel,8,15,"And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants."
1 Samuel,8,16,"And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put [them] to his work."
1 Samuel,8,17,He will take the tenth of your sheep: and you 2f shall be his servants.
1 Samuel,8,18,And you 2f shall cry out in that day because of your king which you 2f shall have chosen you; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will not hear you in that day.
1 Samuel,8,19,"Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Sh’mu’el [His name is El] ; and they said, No; but we will have a king over us;"
1 Samuel,8,20,"That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles."
1 Samuel,8,21,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,8,22,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said to Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , Listen unto their voice, and make them a king. And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said unto the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Go you 2f every man unto his city."
1 Samuel,9,1,"Now there was a man of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , whose name [was] Kish [bent] , the son of Avi’el [El (God) is my father] , the son of Tz’ror [parcel] , the son of B’khorat [first-born] , the son of Afiach [I will make to breathe] , from the tribe of Binyamin [A Son of the Right Hand] , a mighty man of power."
1 Samuel,9,2,"And he had a son, whose name [was] Sha’ul [desired] , a choice young man, and a goodly: and [there was] not among the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward [he was] higher than any of the people."
1 Samuel,9,3,"And the asses of Kish [bent] Sha’ul’s [desired] father were lost. And Kish [bent] said to Sha’ul [desired] his son, Take now one of the servants with you i , and arise, go seek the asses."
1 Samuel,9,4,"And he passed through mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , and passed through the land of Shalishah [night monster; hobgoblin] , but they found [them] not: then they passed through the land of Sha’alim [foxes] , and [there they were] not: and he passed through the land of the Binyamini, but they found [them] not."
1 Samuel,9,5," [And] when they were come to the land of Tzuf [honeycomb] , Sha’ul [desired] said to his servant that [was] with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave [caring] for the asses, and take thought for us."
1 Samuel,9,6,"And he said unto him, Behold now, [there is] in this city a man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and [he is] an honourable man; all that he says comes surely to pass: now let us go there; perhaps he can show us our way that we should go."
1 Samuel,9,7,"Then said Sha’ul [desired] to his servant, But, behold, [if] we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and [there is] not a present to bring to the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : what have we?"
1 Samuel,9,8,"And the servant answered Sha’ul [desired] again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: [that] will I give to the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , to tell us our way."
1 Samuel,9,9,"(Beforetime in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , when a man went to enquire of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , thus he spoke, Come, and let us go to the seer: for [he that is] now [called] a Prophet was formerly called a Seer.)"
1 Samuel,9,10,"Then said Sha’ul [desired] to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [was]."
1 Samuel,9,11," [And] as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?"
1 Samuel,9,12,"And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for [there is] a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:"
1 Samuel,9,13,"As soon as you 2f be come into the city, you 2f shall immediately find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he does bless the sacrifice; [and] afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time you 2f shall find him."
1 Samuel,9,14,"And they went up into the city: [and] when they were come into the city, behold, Sh’mu’el [His name is El] came out against them, for to go up to the high place."
1 Samuel,9,15,"Now the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had told Sh’mu’el [His name is El] in his ear a day before Sha’ul [desired] came, saying,"
1 Samuel,9,16,"Tomorrow about this time I will send you i a man out of the land of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , and you i shall anoint him [to be] captain over my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that he may save my people out of the hand of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] : for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me."
1 Samuel,9,17,"And when Sh’mu’el [His name is El] saw Sha’ul [desired] , the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto him, Behold the man whom I spoke to you i of! this same shall reign over my people."
1 Samuel,9,18,"Then Sha’ul [desired] drew near to Sh’mu’el [His name is El] in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray you i , where the seer’s house [is]."
1 Samuel,9,19,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] answered Sha’ul [desired] , and said, I [am] the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for you 2f shall eat with me to day, and tomorrow I will let you i go, and will tell you i all that [is] in you i heart."
1 Samuel,9,20,"And as for you i asses that were lost three days ago, set not you i mind on them; for they are found. And on whom [is] all the desire of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]? [Is it] not on you i , and on all you i father’s house?"
1 Samuel,9,21,"And Sha’ul [desired] answered and said, [Am] not I from the tribe of Binyamin [A Son of the Right Hand] , of the smallest of the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] ? wherefore then speak you i so to me?"
1 Samuel,9,22,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] took Sha’ul [desired] and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the most important place among them that were bidden, which [were] about thirty persons."
1 Samuel,9,23,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you i , of which I said unto you i , Set it by you i."
1 Samuel,9,24,"And the cook took up the shoulder, and [that] which [was] upon it, and set [it] before Sha’ul [desired] . And [Sh’mu’el [His name is El] ] said, Behold that which is left! set [it] before you i, [and] eat: for unto this time has it been kept for you i since I said, I have invited the people. So Sha’ul [desired] did eat with Sh’mu’el [His name is El] that day."
1 Samuel,9,25,"And when they were come down from the high place into the city, [Sh’mu’el [His name is El] ] communed with Sha’ul [desired] upon the top of the house."
1 Samuel,9,26,"And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Sh’mu’el [His name is El] called Sha’ul [desired] to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send you i away. And Sha’ul [desired] arose, and they went out both of them, he and Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , abroad."
1 Samuel,9,27," [And] as they were going down to the end of the city, Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said to Sha’ul [desired] , Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand you i still a while, that I may show you i the word of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
1 Samuel,10,1,"Then Sh’mu’el [His name is El] took a vial of oil, and poured [it] upon his head, and kissed him, and said, [Is it] not because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has anointed you i [to be] captain over his inheritance?"
1 Samuel,10,2,"When you i are departed from me today, then you i shall find two men by Rachel’s [ewe] sepulcher in the border of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] at Tzeltzah [shadow] ; and they will say unto you i , The asses which you i went to seek are found: and, lo, you i father has left the care of the asses, and sorrows for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?"
1 Samuel,10,3,"Then shall you i go on forward from here, and you i shall come to the plain of Tavor [Mound] , and there shall meet you i three men going up to God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] to Beit-El [House of God] , one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:"
1 Samuel,10,4,"And they will salute you i , and give you i two [loaves] of bread; which you i shall receive of their hands."
1 Samuel,10,5,"After that you i shall come to the hill of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , where [is] the Garrison (fortification; military post) of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] : and it shall come to pass, when you i are come there to the city, that you i shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a Psaltery (stringed instrument, like an harp) , and a tambourine, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:"
1 Samuel,10,6,"And the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will come upon you i , and you i shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man."
1 Samuel,10,7,"And let it be, when these signs are come unto you i, [that] you i do as occasion serve you i ; for God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is] with you i."
1 Samuel,10,8,"And you i shall go down before me to Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] ; and, behold, I will come down unto you i , to offer burnt offerings, [and] to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shall you i wait, till I come to you i , and show you i what you i shall do."
1 Samuel,10,9,"And it was [so] , that when he had turned his back to go from Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day."
1 Samuel,10,10,"And when they came there to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] came upon him, and he prophesied among them."
1 Samuel,10,11,"And it came to pass, when all that knew him formerly saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What [is] this [that] is come unto the son of Kish [bent]? [Is] Sha’ul [desired] also among the prophets?"
1 Samuel,10,12,"And one of the same place answered and said, But who [is] their father? Therefore it became a proverb, [Is] Sha’ul [desired] also among the prophets?"
1 Samuel,10,13,"And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place."
1 Samuel,10,14,"And Sha’ul’s [desired] uncle said unto him and to his servant, Where went you 2f ? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that [they were] nowhere, we came to Sh’mu’el [His name is El]."
1 Samuel,10,15,"And Sha’ul’s [desired] uncle said, Tell me, I pray you i , what Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said unto you."
1 Samuel,10,16,"And Sha’ul [desired] said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Sh’mu’el [His name is El] spoke, he told him not."
1 Samuel,10,17,And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] called the people together unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to Mitzpah [Watchtower];
1 Samuel,10,18,"And said unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , I brought up Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and delivered you out of the hand of the Mitzri, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, [and] of them that oppressed you:"
1 Samuel,10,19,"And you 2f have this day rejected your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and you 2f have said unto him, [No] , but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) by your tribes, and by your thousands."
1 Samuel,10,20,"And when Sh’mu’el [His name is El] had caused all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to come near, the tribe of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] was taken."
1 Samuel,10,21,"When he had caused the tribe of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] to come near by their families, the family of Matri [rain of Yehovah] was taken, and Sha’ul [desired] the son of Kish [bent] was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found."
1 Samuel,10,22,"Therefore they enquired of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) further, if the man should yet come there. And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) answered, Behold, he has hid himself among the stuff."
1 Samuel,10,23,"And they ran and fetched him there: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward."
1 Samuel,10,24,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said to all the people, See you 2f him whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has chosen, that [there is] none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, Long live the king!"
1 Samuel,10,25,"Then Sh’mu’el [His name is El] told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote [it] in a book, and laid [it] up before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] sent all the people away, every man to his house."
1 Samuel,10,26,"And Sha’ul [desired] also went home to Giv’ah [Hill] ; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had touched."
1 Samuel,10,27,"But the children of Belial [Worthless, Good for Nothing] said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace."
1 Samuel,11,1,"Then Nachash [serpent] the ‘Amoni [tribal] came up, and encamped against Yavesh-Gil’ad [Dry Hill of Testimony] : and all the men of Yavesh [dry] said unto Nachash [serpent] , Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you i."
1 Samuel,11,2,"And Nachash [serpent] the ‘Amoni [tribal] answered them, On this [condition] will I make [a covenant] with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it [for] a reproach (disgrace; shame) upon all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Samuel,11,3,"And the elders of Yavesh [dry] said unto him, Give us seven days’ respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and then, if [there be] no man to save us, we will come out to you i."
1 Samuel,11,4,"Then came the messengers to Giv’ah [Hill] of Sha’ul [desired] , and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept."
1 Samuel,11,5,"And, behold, Sha’ul [desired] came after the herd out of the field; and Sha’ul [desired] said, What [ails] the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Yavesh [dry]."
1 Samuel,11,6,"And the Spirit of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] came upon Sha’ul [desired] when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly."
1 Samuel,11,7,"And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent [them] throughout all the coasts of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever comes not forth after Sha’ul [desired] and after Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) fell on the people, and they came out with one consent."
1 Samuel,11,8,"And when he numbered them in Bezek [Lightning] , the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were three hundred thousand, and the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] thirty thousand."
1 Samuel,11,9,"And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall you 2f say unto the men of Yavesh-Gil’ad [Dry Hill of Testimony] , Tomorrow, by [that time] the sun be hot, you 2f shall have help. And the messengers came and showed [it] to the men of Yavesh [dry] ; and they were glad."
1 Samuel,11,10,"Therefore the men of Yavesh [dry] said, Tomorrow we will come out unto you, and you 2f shall do with us all that seems good unto you."
1 Samuel,11,11,"And it was [so] on the morrow, that Sha’ul [desired] put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and killed the ‘Amon [Inbred] until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together."
1 Samuel,11,12,"And the people said unto Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , Who [is] he that said, Shall Sha’ul [desired] reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death."
1 Samuel,11,13,"And Sha’ul [desired] said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for today the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has wrought salvation in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Samuel,11,14,"Then said Sh’mu’el [His name is El] to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] , and renew the kingdom there."
1 Samuel,11,15,"And all the people went to Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] ; and there they made Sha’ul [desired] king before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] ; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and there Sha’ul [desired] and all the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] rejoiced greatly."
1 Samuel,12,1,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said unto all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Behold, I have listened unto your voice in all that you 2f said unto me, and have made a king over you."
1 Samuel,12,2,"And now, behold, the king walks before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons [are] with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day."
1 Samuel,12,3,"Behold, here I [am] : witness against me before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received [any] bribe to blind my eyes with that? and I will restore it you."
1 Samuel,12,4,"And they said, you i have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you i taken ought of any man’s hand."
1 Samuel,12,5,"And he said unto them, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] witness against you, and his anointed [is] witness this day, that you 2f have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, [He is] witness."
1 Samuel,12,6,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said unto the people, [It is] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) that advanced Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and Aharon [Bright, Very High] , and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
1 Samuel,12,7,"Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) of all the righteous acts of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he did to you and to your fathers."
1 Samuel,12,8,"When Ya’akov [Heal of God] was come into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and your fathers cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , then the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and Aharon [Bright, Very High] , which brought forth your fathers out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and made them dwell in this place."
1 Samuel,12,9,"And when they forgot the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , he sold them into the hand of Sisra [Battle Array (to put on; to clothe)] , captain of the host of Hatzor [Castle] , and into the hand of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and into the hand of the king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , and they fought against them."
1 Samuel,12,10,"And they cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and have served Ba’alim [lords (false gods)] and ‘Ashtarot [Star (female deity)] : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you i."
1 Samuel,12,11,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent Yeruba’al [let Ba’al defend] , and B’dan [in judging] , and Yiftach [He Opens] , and Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you 2f dwelled safe."
1 Samuel,12,12,"And when you 2f saw that Nachash [serpent] the king of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] came against you, you 2f said unto me, No; but a king shall reign over us: when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [was] your king."
1 Samuel,12,13,"Now therefore behold the king whom you 2f have chosen, [and] whom you 2f have desired! and, behold, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has set a king over you."
1 Samuel,12,14,"If you 2f will fear the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , then shall both you 2f and also the king that reigns over you continue following the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]:"
1 Samuel,12,15,"But if you 2f will not obey the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , but rebel against the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , then shall the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) be against you, as [it was] against your fathers."
1 Samuel,12,16,"Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will do before your eyes."
1 Samuel,12,17," [Is it] not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and he shall send thunder and rain; that you 2f may perceive and see that your wickedness [is] great, which you 2f have done in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , in asking you a king."
1 Samuel,12,18,So Sh’mu’el [His name is El] called unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) and Sh’mu’el [His name is El].
1 Samuel,12,19,"And all the people said unto Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , Pray for you i servants unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins [this] evil, to ask us a king."
1 Samuel,12,20,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said unto the people, Fear not: you 2f have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , but serve the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) with all your heart;"
1 Samuel,12,21,"And turn you 2f not aside: for [then should you 2f go] after vain [things] , which cannot profit nor deliver; for they [are] vain."
1 Samuel,12,22,For the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake: because it has pleased the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to make you his people.
1 Samuel,12,23,"Moreover as for me, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] forbid that I should sin against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:"
1 Samuel,12,24,"Only fear the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and serve him in twith all your heart: for consider how great [things] he has done for you."
1 Samuel,12,25,"But if you 2f shall still do wickedly, you 2f shall be consumed, both you 2f and your king."
1 Samuel,13,1,"Sha’ul [desired] reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God],"
1 Samuel,13,2,"Sha’ul [desired] chose him three thousand [men] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]; [whereof] two thousand were with Sha’ul [desired] in Mikhmas [hidden] and in mount Beit-El [House of God] , and a thousand were with Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] in Giv’ah [Hill] of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] : and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent."
1 Samuel,13,3,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] struck the Garrison (fortification; military post) of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] that [was] in Geva [hill] , and the P’lishtim [Immigrants] heard [of it] . And Sha’ul [desired] blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] hear."
1 Samuel,13,4,"And all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] heard say [that] Sha’ul [desired] had smitten a Garrison (fortification; military post) of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and [that] Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] also was had in abomination with the P’lishtim [Immigrants] . And the people were called together after Sha’ul [desired] to Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling]."
1 Samuel,13,5,"And the P’lishtim [Immigrants] gathered themselves together to fight with Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which [is] on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Mikhmas [hidden] , eastward from Beit-On [vanity] [house of vanity]."
1 Samuel,13,6,"When the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits."
1 Samuel,13,7,"And [some of] the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] went over Yarden [Descender] to the land of Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] and Gil’ad [Rocky Region] . As for Sha’ul [desired] , he [was] yet in Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] , and all the people followed him trembling."
1 Samuel,13,8,"And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Sh’mu’el [His name is El] [had appointed] : but Sh’mu’el [His name is El] came not to Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] ; and the people were scattered from him."
1 Samuel,13,9,"And Sha’ul [desired] said, Bring here a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering."
1 Samuel,13,10,"And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Sh’mu’el [His name is El] came; and Sha’ul [desired] went out to meet him, that he might salute him."
1 Samuel,13,11,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said, What have you i done? And Sha’ul [desired] said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and [that] you i came not within the days appointed, and [that] the P’lishtim [Immigrants] gathered themselves together at Mikhmas [hidden];"
1 Samuel,13,12,"Therefore said I, The P’lishtim [Immigrants] will come down now upon me to Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] , and I have not made supplication unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering."
1 Samuel,13,13,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said to Sha’ul [desired] , you i have done foolishly: you i have not kept the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which he commanded you i : for now would the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have established you i kingdom upon Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] forever."
1 Samuel,13,14,"But now you i kingdom shall not continue: the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has sought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has commanded him [to be] captain over his people, because you i have not kept [that] which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded you i."
1 Samuel,13,15,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] arose, and got him up from Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] unto Giv’ah [Hill] of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] . And Sha’ul [desired] numbered the people [that were] present with him, about six hundred men."
1 Samuel,13,16,"And Sha’ul [desired] , and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] his son, and the people [that were] present with them, abode in Giv’ah [Hill] of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] : but the P’lishtim [Immigrants] encamped in Mikhmas [hidden]."
1 Samuel,13,17,"And the spoilers came out of the camp of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] in three companies: one company turned unto the way [that leads to] ‘Ofrah [Fawn] , unto the land of Shu’al [jackal]:"
1 Samuel,13,18,And another company turned the way [to] Beit-Horon [House of Hollowness] : and another company turned [to] the way of the border that looks to the valley of Tzvoyim [Gazelles] toward the wilderness.
1 Samuel,13,19,"Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : for the P’lishtim [Immigrants] said, Lest the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] make [them] swords or spears:"
1 Samuel,13,20,"But all the Yisra’eli’s went down to the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter (a sharp iron blade on the front of a plow that cuts into the soil) , and his axe, and his mattock (hoe or other tool to break up dirt)."
1 Samuel,13,21,"Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads."
1 Samuel,13,22,"So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that [were] with Sha’ul [desired] and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] : but with Sha’ul [desired] and with Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] his son was there found."
1 Samuel,13,23,And the Garrison (fortification; military post) of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] went out to the passage of Mikhmas [hidden].
1 Samuel,14,1,"Now it came to pass upon a day, that Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] the son of Sha’ul [desired] said unto the young man that bore his armour, Come, and let us go over to the P’lishtim [Immigrants] ’ Garrison (fortification; military post) , that [is] on the other side. But he told not his father."
1 Samuel,14,2,And Sha’ul [desired] tarried in the uttermost part of Giv’ah [Hill] under a pomegranate tree which [is] in Migron [precipice] : and the people that [were] with him [were] about six hundred men;
1 Samuel,14,3,"And Achiyah [brother of Yehovah] , the son of Achituv [my brother is good] , I-Khavod’s brother, the son of Pinchas [mouth of brass] , the son of ‘Eli [ascension] , the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] priest in Shiloh [Place of Rest] , wearing an ephod (vest) . And the people knew not that Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] was gone."
1 Samuel,14,4,"And between the passages, by which Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] sought to go over unto the P’lishtim [Immigrants] ’ Garrison (fortification; military post), [there was] a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one [was] Botzetz [surpassing white; glistening] , and the name of the other Seneh [thorny]."
1 Samuel,14,5,"The forefront of the one [was] situate northward over against Mikhmas [hidden] , and the other southward over against Giv’ah [Hill]."
1 Samuel,14,6,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] said to the young man that bore his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the Garrison (fortification; military post) of these uncircumcised: it may be that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will work for us: for [there is] no restraint to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to save by many or by few."
1 Samuel,14,7,"And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that [is] in you i heart: turn you i ; behold, I [am] with you i according to you i heart."
1 Samuel,14,8,"Then said Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] , Behold, we will pass over unto [these] men, and we will discover (uncover; reveal; have first sight of) ourselves unto them."
1 Samuel,14,9,"If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them."
1 Samuel,14,10,"But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has delivered them into our hand: and this [shall be] a sign unto us."
1 Samuel,14,11,"And both of them discovered themselves unto the Garrison (fortification; military post) of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] : and the P’lishtim [Immigrants] said, Behold, the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves."
1 Samuel,14,12,"And the men of the Garrison (fortification; military post) answered Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has delivered them into the hand of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Samuel,14,13,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] ; and his armourbearer killed after him."
1 Samuel,14,14,"And that first slaughter, which Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, [which] a yoke [of oxen might plow]."
1 Samuel,14,15,"And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the Garrison (fortification; military post) , and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling."
1 Samuel,14,16,"And the watchmen of Sha’ul [desired] in Giv’ah [Hill] of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down [one another]."
1 Samuel,14,17,"Then said Sha’ul [desired] unto the people that [were] with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] and his armourbearer [were] not [there]."
1 Samuel,14,18,"And Sha’ul [desired] said unto Achiyah [brother of Yehovah] , Bring here the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] . For the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was at that time with the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Samuel,14,19,"And it came to pass, while Sha’ul [desired] talked unto the priest, that the noise that [was] in the host of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] went on and increased: and Sha’ul [desired] said unto the priest, Withdraw you i hand."
1 Samuel,14,20,"And Sha’ul [desired] and all the people that [were] with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, [and there was] a very great discomfiture."
1 Samuel,14,21,"Moreover the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] [that] were with the P’lishtim [Immigrants] before that time, which went up with them into the camp [from the country] round about, even they also [turned] to be with the Yisra’eli’s that [were] with Sha’ul [desired] and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given]."
1 Samuel,14,22,"Likewise all the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] which had hid themselves in mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful], [when] they heard that the P’lishtim [Immigrants] fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle."
1 Samuel,14,23,So the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) saved Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that day: and the battle passed over unto Beit-On [vanity] [house of vanity].
1 Samuel,14,24,"And the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were distressed that day: for Sha’ul [desired] had adjured the people, saying, Cursed [be] the man that eats [any] food until evening, that I may be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted [any] food."
1 Samuel,14,25,And all [they of] the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.
1 Samuel,14,26,"And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath."
1 Samuel,14,27,"But Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that [was] in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened."
1 Samuel,14,28,"Then answered one of the people, and said, Your 1s father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed [be] the man that eats [any] food this day. And the people were faint."
1 Samuel,14,29,"Then said Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] , My father has troubled the land: see, I pray you, how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey."
1 Samuel,14,30,"How much more, if perhaps (maybe) the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the P’lishtim [Immigrants]?"
1 Samuel,14,31,And they struck the P’lishtim [Immigrants] that day from Mikhmas [hidden] to Ayalon [Field of Deer] : and the people were very faint.
1 Samuel,14,32,"And the people flew upon the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) , and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and killed [them] on the ground: and the people did eat [them] with the blood."
1 Samuel,14,33,"Then they told Sha’ul [desired] , saying, Behold, the people sin against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , in that they eat with the blood. And he said, You 2f have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day."
1 Samuel,14,34,"And Sha’ul [desired] said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay [them] here, and eat; and sin not against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and killed [them] there."
1 Samuel,14,35,And Sha’ul [desired] built an altar unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : the same was the first altar that he built unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
1 Samuel,14,36,"And Sha’ul [desired] said, Let us go down after the P’lishtim [Immigrants] by night, and spoil (plunder; prey; booty) them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seems good unto you i . Then said the priest, Let us draw near here unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
1 Samuel,14,37,"And Sha’ul [desired] asked counsel of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , Shall I go down after the P’lishtim [Immigrants] ? will you i deliver them into the hand of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ? But he answered him not that day."
1 Samuel,14,38,"And Sha’ul [desired] said, Draw you 2f near here, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin has been this day."
1 Samuel,14,39,"For, [as] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, which saves Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , though it be in Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] my son, he shall surely die. But [there was] not a man among all the people [that] answered him."
1 Samuel,14,40,"Then said he unto all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Be you 2f on one side, and I and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Sha’ul [desired] , Do what seems good unto you i."
1 Samuel,14,41,"Therefore Sha’ul [desired] said unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Give a perfect [lot] . And Sha’ul [desired] and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] were taken: but the people escaped."
1 Samuel,14,42,"And Sha’ul [desired] said, Cast [lots] between me and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] my son. And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] was taken."
1 Samuel,14,43,"Then Sha’ul [desired] said to Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] , Tell me what you i have done. And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that [was] in my hand, [and] , lo, I must die."
1 Samuel,14,44,"And Sha’ul [desired] answered, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] do so and more also: for you i shall surely die, Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given]."
1 Samuel,14,45,"And the people said unto Sha’ul [desired] , Shall Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] die, who has wrought this great salvation in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ? God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] forbid: [as] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to (to do entirely, do wholly) the ground; for he has wrought with God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] this day. So the people rescued Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] , that he died not."
1 Samuel,14,46,Then Sha’ul [desired] went up from following the P’lishtim [Immigrants] : and the P’lishtim [Immigrants] went to their own place.
1 Samuel,14,47,"So Sha’ul [desired] took the kingdom over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , and against the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , and against Edom [Red] , and against the kings of Tzovah [station] , and against the P’lishtim [Immigrants] : and to wherever he turned himself, he vexed [them]."
1 Samuel,14,48,"And he gathered an host, and struck the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley] , and delivered Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of the hands of them that spoiled them."
1 Samuel,14,49,"Now the sons of Sha’ul [desired] were Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] , and Yishvi [he resembles me] , and Malkishua [my king is wealth] : and the names of his two daughters [were these] ; the name of the firstborn Merav [increase] , and the name of the younger Mikhal [who is like God?]:"
1 Samuel,14,50,"And the name of Sha’ul’s [desired] wife [was] Achino’am [my brother is delight] , the daughter of Achima’atz [my brother is anger (wrath)] : and the name of the captain of his host [was] Avner [my father is a lamp] , the son of Ner [lamp] , Sha’ul’s [desired] uncle."
1 Samuel,14,51,And Kish [bent] [was] the father of Sha’ul [desired] ; and Ner [lamp] the father of Avner [my father is a lamp] [was] the son of Avi’el [El (God) is my father].
1 Samuel,14,52,"And there was sore war against the P’lishtim [Immigrants] all the days of Sha’ul [desired] : and when Sha’ul [desired] saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him."
1 Samuel,15,1,"Sh’mu’el [His name is El] also said unto Sha’ul [desired] , The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent me to anoint you i [to be] king over his people, over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : now therefore hearken you i unto the voice of the words of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,15,2,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , I remember [that] which ‘Amalek [Dweller in a Valley] did to Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , how he laid [wait] for him in the way, when he came up from Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
1 Samuel,15,3,"Now go and strike ‘Amalek [Dweller in a Valley] , and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass."
1 Samuel,15,4,"And Sha’ul [desired] gathered the people together, and numbered them in T’la’im [lambs] , two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
1 Samuel,15,5,"And Sha’ul [desired] came to a city of ‘Amalek [Dweller in a Valley] , and laid wait in the valley."
1 Samuel,15,6,"And Sha’ul [desired] said unto the Keini [traveling tinkers or blacksmiths] , Go, depart, get you down from among the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley] , lest I destroy you with them: for you 2f showed kindness to all the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , when they came up out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] . So the Keini [traveling tinkers or blacksmiths] departed from among the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley]."
1 Samuel,15,7,"And Sha’ul [desired] struck the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley] from Havilah (Stretch of Sand) [until] you i come to Shur [wall] , that [is] over against Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
1 Samuel,15,8,"And he took Agag [Violent] the king of the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley] alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword."
1 Samuel,15,9,"But Sha’ul [desired] and the people spared Agag [Violent] , and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all [that was] good, and would not utterly destroy them: but everything [that was] vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly."
1 Samuel,15,10,"Then came the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , saying,"
1 Samuel,15,11,"It repents me that I have set up Sha’ul [desired] [to be] king: for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. And it grieved Sh’mu’el [His name is El] ; and he cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) all night."
1 Samuel,15,12,"And when Sh’mu’el [His name is El] rose early to meet Sha’ul [desired] in the morning, it was told Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , saying, Sha’ul [desired] came to Carmel [Garden-land] , and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling]."
1 Samuel,15,13,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] came to Sha’ul [desired] : and Sha’ul [desired] said unto him, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] you i of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : I have performed the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,15,14,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said, What [means] then this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?"
1 Samuel,15,15,"And Sha’ul [desired] said, They have brought them from the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley] : for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; and the rest we have utterly destroyed."
1 Samuel,15,16,"Then Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said unto Sha’ul [desired] , Stay, and I will tell you i what the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on."
1 Samuel,15,17,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said, When you i [were] little in you i own sight, [were] you i not [made] the head of the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) anointed you i king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
1 Samuel,15,18,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent you i on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley] , and fight against them until they be consumed."
1 Samuel,15,19,"For what reason then did you i not obey the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , but did fly upon the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) , and did evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)?"
1 Samuel,15,20,"And Sha’ul [desired] said unto Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , Yes, I have obeyed the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and have gone the way which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent me, and have brought Agag [Violent] the king of ‘Amalek [Dweller in a Valley] , and have utterly destroyed the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley]."
1 Samuel,15,21,"But the people took of the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) , sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling]."
1 Samuel,15,22,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said, Has the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [as great] delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ? Behold, to obey [is] better than sacrifice, [and] to hearken than the fat of rams."
1 Samuel,15,23,"For rebellion [is as] the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness [is as] iniquity and idolatry. Because you i have rejected the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , he has also rejected you i from [being] king."
1 Samuel,15,24,"And Sha’ul [desired] said unto Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and you i words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice."
1 Samuel,15,25,"Now therefore, I pray you i , pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,15,26,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said unto Sha’ul [desired] , I will not return with you i : for you i have rejected the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has rejected you i from being king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Samuel,15,27,"And as Sh’mu’el [His name is El] turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his Mantle (cloak; covering garment) (cloak) , and it rent."
1 Samuel,15,28,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said unto him, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has rent the kingdom of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] from you i this day, and has given it to a neighbour of you i, [that is] better than you i."
1 Samuel,15,29,"And also the Strength of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] will not lie nor repent: for he [is] not a man, that he should repent."
1 Samuel,15,30,"Then he said, I have sinned: [yet] honour me now, I pray you i , before the elders of my people, and before Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
1 Samuel,15,31,So Sh’mu’el [His name is El] turned again after Sha’ul [desired] ; and Sha’ul [desired] worshipped the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
1 Samuel,15,32,"Then said Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , Bring you 2f here to me Agag [Violent] the king of the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley] . And Agag [Violent] came unto him delicately. And Agag [Violent] said, Surely the bitterness of death is past."
1 Samuel,15,33,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said, As you i sword has made women childless, so shall you i mother be childless among women. And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] hewed Agag [Violent] in pieces before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling]."
1 Samuel,15,34,Then Sh’mu’el [His name is El] went to Ramah [Hill] ; and Sha’ul [desired] went up to his house to Giv’ah [Hill] of Sha’ul [desired].
1 Samuel,15,35,And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] came no more to see Sha’ul [desired] until the day of his death: nevertheless Sh’mu’el [His name is El] mourned for Sha’ul [desired] : and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) repented that he had made Sha’ul [desired] king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
1 Samuel,16,1,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , How long will you i mourn for Sha’ul [desired] , seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ? fill you i horn with oil, and go, I will send you i to Yishai [I possess] the Beit-Lachmi [house of bread] : for I have provided me a king among his sons."
1 Samuel,16,2,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said, How can I go? if Sha’ul [desired] hear [it] , he will kill me. And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, Take an heifer with you i , and say, I am come to sacrifice to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,16,3,"And call Yishai [I possess] to the sacrifice, and I will show you i what you i shall do: and you i shall anoint unto me [him] whom I name unto you i."
1 Samuel,16,4,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] did that which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke, and came to Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] . And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Come you i peaceably?"
1 Samuel,16,5,"And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Yishai [I possess] and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice."
1 Samuel,16,6,"And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on ‘Eli’av [My Father is God] , and said, Surely the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] anointed [is] before him."
1 Samuel,16,7,"But the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , Look not on his Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor) , or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for [the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sees] not as man sees; for man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) looks on the heart."
1 Samuel,16,8,"Then Yishai [I possess] called Avinadav [my father is noble] , and made him pass before Sh’mu’el [His name is El] . And he said, Neither has the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) chosen this."
1 Samuel,16,9,"Then Yishai [I possess] made Shammah [astonishment] to pass by. And he said, Neither has the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) chosen this."
1 Samuel,16,10,"Again, Yishai [I possess] made seven of his sons to pass before Sh’mu’el [His name is El] . And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said unto Yishai [I possess] , The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has not chosen these."
1 Samuel,16,11,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said unto Yishai [I possess] , Are here all [you i ] children? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he keeps the sheep. And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said unto Yishai [I possess] , Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come here."
1 Samuel,16,12,"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he [was] ruddy (reddish hair or complexion), [and] withal of a beautiful Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor) , and goodly to look to. And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, Arise, anoint him: for this [is] he."
1 Samuel,16,13,"Then Sh’mu’el [His name is El] took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came upon David [beloved] from that day forward. So Sh’mu’el [His name is El] rose up, and went to Ramah [Hill]."
1 Samuel,16,14,"But the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) departed from Sha’ul [desired] , and an evil spirit from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) troubled him."
1 Samuel,16,15,"And Sha’ul’s [desired] servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] troubles you i."
1 Samuel,16,16,"Let our lord now command your i servants, [which are] before you i , to seek out a man, [who is] a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] is upon you i , that he shall play with his hand, and you i shall be well."
1 Samuel,16,17,"And Sha’ul [desired] said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring [him] to me."
1 Samuel,16,18,"Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Yishai [I possess] the Beit-Lachmi [house of bread], [that is] cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely (attractive; proper (one’s own; peculiar; particular); becoming) person, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] with him."
1 Samuel,16,19,"For what reason Sha’ul [desired] sent messengers unto Yishai [I possess] , and said, Send me David [beloved] you i son, which [is] with the sheep."
1 Samuel,16,20,"And Yishai [I possess] took an ass [laden] with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent [them] by David [beloved] his son unto Sha’ul [desired]."
1 Samuel,16,21,"And David [beloved] came to Sha’ul [desired] , and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer."
1 Samuel,16,22,"And Sha’ul [desired] sent to Yishai [I possess] , saying, Let David [beloved] , I pray you i , stand before me; for he has found favour in my sight."
1 Samuel,16,23,"And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit from God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was upon Sha’ul [desired] , that David [beloved] took an harp, and played with his hand: so Sha’ul [desired] was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."
1 Samuel,17,1,"Now the P’lishtim [Immigrants] gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Sokhoh [bushy] , which [belongs] to Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and pitched between Sokhoh [bushy] and ‘Azekah [Dug Over] , in Efes-Damim [edge of blood]."
1 Samuel,17,2,"And Sha’ul [desired] and the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah [an oak] , and set the battle in array (to put on; to clothe) against the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."
1 Samuel,17,3,"And the P’lishtim [Immigrants] stood on a mountain on the one side, and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] stood on a mountain on the other side: and [there was] a valley between them."
1 Samuel,17,4,"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , named Golyat [splendor] , of Gat [Winepress] , whose height [was] six cubits and a span."
1 Samuel,17,5,"And [he had] an helmet of brass upon his head, and he [was] armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat [was] five thousand shekels of brass."
1 Samuel,17,6,"And [he had] greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target (small shield; buckler) of brass between his shoulders."
1 Samuel,17,7,And the staff of his spear [was] like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head [weighed] six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.
1 Samuel,17,8,"And he stood and cried unto the armies of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and said unto them, Why are you 2f come out to set [your] battle in array (to put on; to clothe)? [am] not I a P’lishtim [immigrants] , and you 2f servants to Sha’ul [desired] ? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me."
1 Samuel,17,9,"If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall you 2f be our servants, and serve us."
1 Samuel,17,10,"And the P’lishtim [immigrants] said, I defy the armies of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] this day; give me a man, that we may fight together."
1 Samuel,17,11,"When Sha’ul [desired] and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] heard those words of the P’lishtim [immigrants] , they were dismayed, and greatly afraid."
1 Samuel,17,12,"Now David [beloved] [was] the son of that Efrat [ashiness: fruitfulness] of Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] in Y’hudah, whose name [was] Yishai [I possess] ; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men [for] an old man in the days of Sha’ul [desired]."
1 Samuel,17,13,"And the three eldest sons of Yishai [I possess] went [and] followed Sha’ul [desired] to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle [were] ‘Eli’av [My Father is God] the firstborn, and next unto him Avinadav [my father is noble] , and the third Shammah [astonishment]."
1 Samuel,17,14,And David [beloved] [was] the youngest: and the three eldest followed Sha’ul [desired].
1 Samuel,17,15,But David [beloved] went and returned from Sha’ul [desired] to feed his father’s sheep at Beit-Lechem [House of Bread].
1 Samuel,17,16,"And the P’lishtim [immigrants] drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days."
1 Samuel,17,17,"And Yishai [I possess] said unto David [beloved] his son, Take now for you i brethren an eifah of this parched [corn] , and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to you i brethren;"
1 Samuel,17,18,"And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of [their] thousand, and look how you i brethren fare, and take their pledge."
1 Samuel,17,19,"Now Sha’ul [desired] , and they, and all the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [were] in the valley of Elah [an oak] , fighting with the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."
1 Samuel,17,20,"And David [beloved] rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Yishai [I possess] had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle."
1 Samuel,17,21,"For Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and the P’lishtim [Immigrants] had put the battle in array (to put on; to clothe) , army against army."
1 Samuel,17,22,"And David [beloved] left his carriage (baggage) in the hand of the keeper of the carriage (baggage) , and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren."
1 Samuel,17,23,"And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the P’lishtim [immigrants] of Gat [Winepress] , Golyat [splendor] by name, out of the armies of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and spoke according to the same words: and David [beloved] heard [them]."
1 Samuel,17,24,"And all the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid."
1 Samuel,17,25,"And the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said, Have you 2f seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] is he come up: and it shall be, [that] the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Samuel,17,26,"And David [beloved] spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that kills this P’lishtim [immigrants] , and takes away the reproach (disgrace; shame) from Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ? for who [is] this uncircumcised P’lishtim [immigrants] , that he should defy the armies of the living God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]?"
1 Samuel,17,27,"And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that kills him."
1 Samuel,17,28,"And ‘Eli’av [My Father is God] his eldest brother heard when he spoke unto the men; and ‘Eli’av [My Father is God] ’s anger was kindled against David [beloved] , and he said, Why came you i down here? and with whom have you i left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know you i pride, and the naughtiness of you i heart; for you i are come down that you i might see the battle."
1 Samuel,17,29,"And David [beloved] said, What have I now done? [Is there] not a cause?"
1 Samuel,17,30,"And he turned from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner."
1 Samuel,17,31,"And when the words were heard which David [beloved] spoke, they rehearsed [them] before Sha’ul [desired] : and he sent for him."
1 Samuel,17,32,"And David [beloved] said to Sha’ul [desired] , Let no man’s heart fail because of him; you i servant will go and fight with this P’lishtim [immigrants]."
1 Samuel,17,33,"And Sha’ul [desired] said to David [beloved] , you i are not able to go against this P’lishtim [immigrants] to fight with him: for you i [are but] a youth, and he a man of war from his youth."
1 Samuel,17,34,"And David [beloved] said unto Sha’ul [desired] , You 1s servant kept his father’s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:"
1 Samuel,17,35,"And I went out after him, and struck him, and delivered [it] out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught [him] by his beard, and struck him, and killed him."
1 Samuel,17,36,"You 1s servant killed both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised P’lishtim [immigrants] shall be as one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
1 Samuel,17,37,"David [beloved] said moreover, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this P’lishtim [immigrants] . And Sha’ul [desired] said unto David [beloved] , Go, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) be with you i."
1 Samuel,17,38,"And Sha’ul [desired] armed David [beloved] with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail."
1 Samuel,17,39,"And David [beloved] girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed (attempted; tested; analyzed) to go; for he had not proved [it] . And David [beloved] said unto Sha’ul [desired] , I cannot go with these; for I have not proved [them] . And David [beloved] put them off him."
1 Samuel,17,40,"And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling [was] in his hand: and he drew near to the P’lishtim [immigrants]."
1 Samuel,17,41,And the P’lishtim [immigrants] came on and drew near unto David [beloved] ; and the man that bore the shield [went] before him.
1 Samuel,17,42,"And when the P’lishtim [immigrants] looked about, and saw David [beloved] , he disdained him: for he was [but] a youth, and ruddy (reddish hair or complexion) , and of a fair Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor)."
1 Samuel,17,43,"And the P’lishtim [immigrants] said unto David [beloved], [Am] I a dog, that you i come to me with rods (clubs)? And the P’lishtim [immigrants] cursed David [beloved] by his gods."
1 Samuel,17,44,"And the P’lishtim [immigrants] said to David [beloved] , Come to me, and I will give you i flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field."
1 Samuel,17,45,"Then said David [beloved] to the P’lishtim [immigrants] , you i come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to you i in the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of the armies of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , whom you i have defied."
1 Samuel,17,46,"This day will the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) deliver you i into my hand; and I will strike you i , and take you i head from you i ; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Samuel,17,47,"And all this assembly shall know that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) saves not with sword and spear: for the battle [is] the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] , and he will give you into our hands."
1 Samuel,17,48,"And it came to pass, when the P’lishtim [immigrants] arose, and came and drew near to meet David [beloved] , that David [beloved] hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the P’lishtim [immigrants]."
1 Samuel,17,49,"And David [beloved] put his hand in his bag, and took there a stone, and slang [it] , and struck the P’lishtim [immigrants] in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth."
1 Samuel,17,50,"So David [beloved] prevailed over the P’lishtim [immigrants] with a sling and with a stone, and struck the P’lishtim [immigrants] , and killed him; but [there was] no sword in the hand of David [beloved]."
1 Samuel,17,51,"Therefore David [beloved] ran, and stood upon the P’lishtim [immigrants] , and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and killed him, and cut off his head with that. And when the P’lishtim [Immigrants] saw their champion was dead, they fled."
1 Samuel,17,52,"And the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] arose, and shouted, and pursued the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , until you i come to the valley, and to the gates of ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots] . And the wounded of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] fell down by the way to Sha’arayim [double gate] , even unto Gat [Winepress] , and unto ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots]."
1 Samuel,17,53,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] returned from chasing after the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and they spoiled their tents."
1 Samuel,17,54,"And David [beloved] took the head of the P’lishtim [immigrants] , and brought it to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; but he put his armour in his tent."
1 Samuel,17,55,"And when Sha’ul [desired] saw David [beloved] go forth against the P’lishtim [immigrants] , he said unto Avner [my father is a lamp] , the captain of the host, Avner [my father is a lamp] , whose son [is] this youth? And Avner [my father is a lamp] said, [As] you i soul lives, O king, I cannot tell."
1 Samuel,17,56,"And the king said, Enquire you i whose son the stripling [is]."
1 Samuel,17,57,"And as David [beloved] returned from the slaughter of the P’lishtim [immigrants] , Avner [my father is a lamp] took him, and brought him before Sha’ul [desired] with the head of the P’lishtim [immigrants] in his hand."
1 Samuel,17,58,"And Sha’ul [desired] said to him, Whose son [are] you i, [you i ] young man? And David [beloved] answered, I [am] the son of you i servant Yishai [I possess] the Beit-Lachmi [house of bread]."
1 Samuel,18,1,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Sha’ul [desired] , that the soul of Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] was knit with the soul of David [beloved] , and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] loved him as his own soul."
1 Samuel,18,2,"And Sha’ul [desired] took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father’s house."
1 Samuel,18,3,"Then Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] and David [beloved] made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul."
1 Samuel,18,4,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] stripped himself of the robe that [was] upon him, and gave it to David [beloved] , and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his belt."
1 Samuel,18,5,"And David [beloved] went out to wherever Sha’ul [desired] sent him, [and] behaved himself wisely: and Sha’ul [desired] set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Sha’ul’s [desired] servants."
1 Samuel,18,6,"And it came to pass as they came, when David [beloved] was returned from the slaughter of the P’lishtim [immigrants] , that the women came out of all cities of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , singing and dancing, to meet king Sha’ul [desired] , with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of music."
1 Samuel,18,7,"And the women answered [one another] as they played, and said, Sha’ul [desired] has slain his thousands, and David [beloved] his ten thousands."
1 Samuel,18,8,"And Sha’ul [desired] was very exceedingly angry, and the saying displeased him; nd he said, They have ascribed unto David [beloved] ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed [but] thousands: and [what] can he have more but the kingdom?"
1 Samuel,18,9,And Sha’ul [desired] eyed David [beloved] from that day and forward.
1 Samuel,18,10,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] came upon Sha’ul [desired] , and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David [beloved] played with his hand, as at other times: and [there was] a javelin in Sha’ul’s [desired] hand."
1 Samuel,18,11,"And Sha’ul [desired] cast the javelin; for he said, I will strike David [beloved] even to the wall [with it] . And David [beloved] avoided out of his presence twice."
1 Samuel,18,12,"And Sha’ul [desired] was afraid of David [beloved] , because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was with him, and was departed from Sha’ul [desired]."
1 Samuel,18,13,"Therefore Sha’ul [desired] removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people."
1 Samuel,18,14,And David [beloved] behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [was] with him.
1 Samuel,18,15,"For what reason when Sha’ul [desired] saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him."
1 Samuel,18,16,"But all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] loved David [beloved] , because he went out and came in before them."
1 Samuel,18,17,"And Sha’ul [desired] said to David [beloved] , Behold my elder daughter Merav [increase] , her will I give you i to wife: only be you i valiant for me, and fight the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] battles. For Sha’ul [desired] said, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] be upon him."
1 Samuel,18,18,"And David [beloved] said unto Sha’ul [desired] , Who [am] I? and what [is] my life, [or] my father’s family in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that I should be son in law to the king?"
1 Samuel,18,19,"But it came to pass at the time when Merav [increase] Sha’ul’s [desired] daughter should have been given to David [beloved] , that she was given unto Adri’el [flock of God] the Mecholati [dancing (in sadness)] to wife."
1 Samuel,18,20,"And Mikhal [who is like God?] Sha’ul’s [desired] daughter loved David [beloved] : and they told Sha’ul [desired] , and the thing pleased him."
1 Samuel,18,21,"And Sha’ul [desired] said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] may be against him. For what reason Sha’ul [desired] said to David [beloved] , you i shall this day be my son in law in [the one of] the two."
1 Samuel,18,22,"And Sha’ul [desired] commanded his servants, [saying] , Commune with David [beloved] secretly, and say, Behold, the king has delight in you i , and all his servants love you i : now therefore be the king’s son in law."
1 Samuel,18,23,"And Sha’ul’s [desired] servants spoke those words in the ears of David [beloved] . And David [beloved] said, Seem it to you [a] light [thing] to be a king’s son in law, seeing that I [am] a poor man, and lightly esteemed?"
1 Samuel,18,24,"And the servants of Sha’ul [desired] told him, saying, On this manner spoke David [beloved]."
1 Samuel,18,25,"And Sha’ul [desired] said, Thus shall you 2f say to David [beloved] , The king desires not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , to be avenged of the king’s enemies. But Sha’ul [desired] thought to make David [beloved] fall by the hand of the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."
1 Samuel,18,26,"And when his servants told David [beloved] these words, it pleased David [beloved] well to be the king’s son in law: and the days were not expired."
1 Samuel,18,27,"For what reason David [beloved] arose and went, he and his men, and killed of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] two hundred men; and David [beloved] brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king’s son in law. And Sha’ul [desired] gave him Mikhal [who is like God?] his daughter to wife."
1 Samuel,18,28,"And Sha’ul [desired] saw and knew that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [was] with David [beloved] , and [that] Mikhal [who is like God?] Sha’ul’s [desired] daughter loved him."
1 Samuel,18,29,And Sha’ul [desired] was yet the more afraid of David [beloved] ; and Sha’ul [desired] became David’s [beloved] ’s enemy continually.
1 Samuel,18,30,"Then the princes of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, [that] David [beloved] behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Sha’ul [desired] ; so that his name was much set by."
1 Samuel,19,1,"And Sha’ul [desired] spoke to Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David [beloved]."
1 Samuel,19,2,"But Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] Sha’ul’s [desired] son delighted much in David [beloved] : and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] told David [beloved] , saying, Sha’ul [desired] my father seeks to kill you i : now therefore, I pray you i , take heed to yourself until the morning, and abide in a secret [place] , and hide yourself:"
1 Samuel,19,3,"And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you i [are] , and I will commune with my father of you i ; and what I see, that I will tell you i."
1 Samuel,19,4,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] spoke good of David [beloved] unto Sha’ul [desired] his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David [beloved] ; because he has not sinned against you i , and because his works [have been] to you i -ward (in custody, with a guard; prison) very good:"
1 Samuel,19,5,"For he did put his life in his hand, and killed the P’lishtim [immigrants] , and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) wrought a great salvation for all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : you i saw [it] , and did rejoice: wherefore then will you i sin against innocent blood, to slay David [beloved] without a cause?"
1 Samuel,19,6,"And Sha’ul [desired] listened unto the voice of Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] : and Sha’ul [desired] swore, [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, he shall not be slain."
1 Samuel,19,7,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] called David [beloved] , and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] showed him all those things. And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] brought David [beloved] to Sha’ul [desired] , and he was in his presence, as in times past."
1 Samuel,19,8,"And there was war again: and David [beloved] went out, and fought with the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and killed them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him."
1 Samuel,19,9,"And the evil spirit from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was upon Sha’ul [desired] , as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David [beloved] played with [his] hand."
1 Samuel,19,10,"And Sha’ul [desired] sought to strike David [beloved] even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Sha’ul’s [desired] presence, and he struck the javelin into the wall: and David [beloved] fled, and escaped that night."
1 Samuel,19,11,"Sha’ul [desired] also sent messengers unto David’s [beloved] ’s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Mikhal [who is like God?] David’s [beloved] ’s wife told him, saying, If you i save not you i life tonight, tomorrow you i shall be slain."
1 Samuel,19,12,"So Mikhal [who is like God?] let David [beloved] down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped."
1 Samuel,19,13,"And Mikhal [who is like God?] took an image, and laid [it] in the bed, and put a pillow of goats’ [hair] for his bolster (pillow; head - or other - support) , and covered [it] with a cloth."
1 Samuel,19,14,"And when Sha’ul [desired] sent messengers to take David [beloved] , she said, He [is] sick."
1 Samuel,19,15,"And Sha’ul [desired] sent the messengers [again] to see David [beloved] , saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him."
1 Samuel,19,16,"And when the messengers were come in, behold, [there was] an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats’ [hair] for his bolster (pillow; head - or other - support)."
1 Samuel,19,17,"And Sha’ul [desired] said unto Mikhal [who is like God?] , Why have you i deceived me so, and sent away my enemy, that he is escaped? And Mikhal [who is like God?] answered Sha’ul [desired] , He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill you i?"
1 Samuel,19,18,"So David [beloved] fled, and escaped, and came to Sh’mu’el [His name is El] to Ramah [Hill] , and told him all that Sha’ul [desired] had done to him. And he and Sh’mu’el [His name is El] went and dwelt in Nayot [the prophet’s dormitory]."
1 Samuel,19,19,"And it was told Sha’ul [desired] , saying, Behold, David [beloved] [is] at Nayot [the prophet’s dormitory] in Ramah [Hill]."
1 Samuel,19,20,"And Sha’ul [desired] sent messengers to take David [beloved] : and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Sh’mu’el [His name is El] standing [as] appointed over them, the Spirit of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was upon the messengers of Sha’ul [desired] , and they also prophesied."
1 Samuel,19,21,"And when it was told Sha’ul [desired] , he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Sha’ul [desired] sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also."
1 Samuel,19,22,"Then went he also to Ramah [Hill] , and came to a great well that [is] in Sekhu [the watch-tower] : and he asked and said, Where [are] Sh’mu’el [His name is El] and David [beloved] ? And [one] said, Behold, [they be] at Nayot [the prophet’s dormitory] in Ramah [Hill]."
1 Samuel,19,23,"And he went there to Nayot [the prophet’s dormitory] in Ramah [Hill] : and the Spirit of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Nayot [the prophet’s dormitory] in Ramah [Hill]."
1 Samuel,19,24,"And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Sh’mu’el [His name is El] in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. For this reason they say, [Is] Sha’ul [desired] also among the prophets?"
1 Samuel,20,1,"And David [beloved] fled from Nayot [the prophet’s dormitory] in Ramah [Hill] , and came and said before Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] , What have I done? what [is] my iniquity? and what [is] my sin before you i father, that he seeks my life?"
1 Samuel,20,2,"And he said unto him, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] forbid; you i shall not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will show it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it [is] not [so]."
1 Samuel,20,3,"And David [beloved] swore moreover, and said, You 1s father certainly knows that I have found grace in you i eyes; and he says, Let not Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] know this, lest he be grieved: but truly [as] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, and [as] you i soul lives, [there is] but a step between me and death."
1 Samuel,20,4,"Then said Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] unto David [beloved] , Whatsoever you i soul desires, I will even do [it] for you i."
1 Samuel,20,5,"And David [beloved] said unto Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] , Behold, tomorrow [is] the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third [day] at even."
1 Samuel,20,6,"If you i father at all miss me, then say, David [beloved] earnestly asked [leave] of me that he might run to Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] his city: for [there is] a yearly sacrifice there for all the family."
1 Samuel,20,7,"If he say thus, [It is] well; your i servant shall have peace: but if he be very exceedingly angry, [then] be sure that evil is determined by him."
1 Samuel,20,8,"Therefore you i shall deal kindly with your i servant; for you i have brought your i servant into a covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) with you i : notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me yourself; for why should you i bring me to your i father?"
1 Samuel,20,9,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] said, Far be it from you i : for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon you i , then would not I tell it you i?"
1 Samuel,20,10,"Then said David [beloved] to Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] , Who shall tell me? or what [if] your i father answer you i roughly?"
1 Samuel,20,11,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] said unto David [beloved] , Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field."
1 Samuel,20,12,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] said unto David [beloved] , O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , when I have sounded my father about tomorrow any time, [or] the third [day] , and, behold, [if there be] good toward David [beloved] , and I then send not unto you i , and show it you i;"
1 Samuel,20,13,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) do so and much more to Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] : but if it please my father [to do] you i evil, then I will show it you i , and send you i away, that you i may go in peace: and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) be with you i , as he has been with my father."
1 Samuel,20,14,"And you i shall not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that I die not:"
1 Samuel,20,15,"But [also] you i shall not cut off you i kindness from my house forever: no, not when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has cut off the enemies of David [beloved] everyone from the face of the earth."
1 Samuel,20,16,"So Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] made [a covenant] with the house of David [beloved], [saying] , Let the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) even require [it] at the hand of David’s [beloved] ’s enemies."
1 Samuel,20,17,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] caused David [beloved] to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul."
1 Samuel,20,18,"Then Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] said to David [beloved] , Tomorrow [is] the new moon: and you i shall be missed, because you i seat will be empty."
1 Samuel,20,19,"And [when] you i have detained (held) three days, [then] you i shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you i did hide yourself when the business was [in hand] , and shall remain by the stone Ezel [departure]."
1 Samuel,20,20,"And I will shoot three arrows on the side [thereof] , as though I shot at a mark."
1 Samuel,20,21,"And, behold, I will send a boy, [saying] , Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the boy, Behold, the arrows [are] on this side of you i , take them; then come you i : for [there is] peace to you i , and no hurt; [as] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives."
1 Samuel,20,22,"But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows [are] beyond you i ; go you i way: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has sent you i away."
1 Samuel,20,23,"And [as touching] the matter which you i and I have spoken of, behold, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [be] between you i and me forever."
1 Samuel,20,24,"So David [beloved] hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat."
1 Samuel,20,25,"And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, [even] upon a seat by the wall: and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] arose, and Avner [my father is a lamp] sat by Sha’ul’s [desired] side, and David’s [beloved] ’s place was empty."
1 Samuel,20,26,"Nevertheless Sha’ul [desired] spoke not anything that day: for he thought, Something has befallen him, he [is] not clean; surely he [is] not clean."
1 Samuel,20,27,"And it came to pass on the morrow, [which was] the second [day] of the month, that David’s [beloved] ’s place was empty: and Sha’ul [desired] said unto Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] his son, For what reason comes not the son of Yishai [I possess] to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?"
1 Samuel,20,28,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] answered Sha’ul [desired] , David [beloved] earnestly asked [leave] of me [to go] to Beit-Lechem [House of Bread]:"
1 Samuel,20,29,"And he said, Let me go, I pray you i ; for our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me [to be there] : and now, if I have found favour in you i eyes, let me get away, I pray you i , and see my brethren. Therefore he comes not unto the king’s table."
1 Samuel,20,30,"Then Sha’ul’s [desired] anger was kindled against Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] , and he said unto him, you i son of the perverse rebellious [woman] , do not I know that you i have chosen the son of Yishai [I possess] to you i own confusion, and unto the confusion of you i mother’s nakedness?"
1 Samuel,20,31,"For as long as the son of Yishai [I possess] lives upon the ground, you i shall not be established, nor you i kingdom. For what reason now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die."
1 Samuel,20,32,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] answered Sha’ul [desired] his father, and said unto him, For what reason shall he be slain? what has he done?"
1 Samuel,20,33,And Sha’ul [desired] cast a javelin at him to strike him: whereby Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] knew that it was determined of his father to slay David [beloved].
1 Samuel,20,34,"So Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David [beloved] , because his father had done him shame."
1 Samuel,20,35,"And it came to pass in the morning, that Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] went out into the field at the time appointed with David [beloved] , and a little boy with him."
1 Samuel,20,36,"And he said unto his boy, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. [And] as the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him."
1 Samuel,20,37,"And when the boy was come to the place of the arrow which Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] had shot, Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] cried after the boy, and said, [Is] not the arrow beyond you i?"
1 Samuel,20,38,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] cried after the boy, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] ’s boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master."
1 Samuel,20,39,But the boy knew not anything: only Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] and David [beloved] knew the matter.
1 Samuel,20,40,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] gave his artillery unto his boy, and said unto him, Go, carry [them] to the city."
1 Samuel,20,41," [And] as soon as the boy was gone, David [beloved] arose out of [a place] toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David [beloved] exceeded."
1 Samuel,20,42,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] said to David [beloved] , Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) be between me and you i , and between my seed and you i seed forever. And he arose and departed: and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] went into the city."
1 Samuel,21,1,"Then came David [beloved] to Nov [high place] to Achi-Melekh [my brother is king] the priest: and Achi-Melekh [my brother is king] was afraid at the meeting of David [beloved] , and said unto him, Why [are] you i alone, and no man with you i?"
1 Samuel,21,2,"And David [beloved] said unto Achi-Melekh [my brother is king] the priest, The king has commanded me a business, and has said unto me, Let no man know anything of the business about which I send you i , and what I have commanded you i : and I have appointed [my] servants to such and such a place."
1 Samuel,21,3,"Now therefore what is under you i hand? give [me] five [loaves of] bread in my hand, or what there is present."
1 Samuel,21,4,"And the priest answered David [beloved] , and said, [There is] no common bread under my hand, but there is consecrated bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women."
1 Samuel,21,5,"And David [beloved] answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a twomen [have been] kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and [the bread is] in a manner common, yes, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel."
1 Samuel,21,6,"So the priest gave him consecrated [bread] : for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away."
1 Samuel,21,7,"Now a certain man of the servants of Sha’ul [desired] [was] there that day, detained before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and his name [was] Do’eg [fearing] , an Edomi [red] , the most important of the herdsmen that [belonged] to Sha’ul [desired]."
1 Samuel,21,8,"And David [beloved] said unto Achi-Melekh [my brother is king] , And is there not here under you i hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste."
1 Samuel,21,9,"And the priest said, The sword of Golyat [splendor] the P’lishtim [immigrants] , whom you i killed in the valley of Elah [an oak] , behold, it [is here] wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod (vest) : if you i will take that, take [it] : for [there is] no other save that here. And David [beloved] said, [There is] none like that; give it me."
1 Samuel,21,10,"And David [beloved] arose, and fled that day for fear of Sha’ul [desired] , and went to Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man] the king of Gat [Winepress]."
1 Samuel,21,11,"And the servants of Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man] said unto him, [Is] not this David [beloved] the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Sha’ul [desired] has slain his thousands, and David [beloved] his ten thousands?"
1 Samuel,21,12,"And David [beloved] laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man] the king of Gat [Winepress]."
1 Samuel,21,13,"And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard."
1 Samuel,21,14,"Then said Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man] unto his servants, Lo, you 2f see the man is mad: wherefore [then] have you 2f brought him to me?"
1 Samuel,21,15,"Have I need of mad men, that you 2f have brought this [fellow] to play the mad man in my presence? shall this [fellow] come into my house?"
1 Samuel,22,1,"David [beloved] therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave ‘Adulam [Justice of the People] : and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard [it] , they went down there to him."
1 Samuel,22,2,"And everyone [that was] in distress, and everyone that [was] in debt, and everyone [that was] discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men."
1 Samuel,22,3,"And David [beloved] went there to Mitzpah [Watchtower] of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] : and he said unto the king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , Let my father and my mother, I pray you i , come forth, [and be] with you, till I know what God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] will do for me."
1 Samuel,22,4,And he brought them before the king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] : and they dwelt with him all the while that David [beloved] was in the hold.
1 Samuel,22,5,"And the prophet Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] said unto David [beloved] , Abide not in the hold; depart, and get you i into the land of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] . Then David [beloved] departed, and came into the forest of Haret [forest]."
1 Samuel,22,6,"When Sha’ul [desired] heard that David [beloved] was discovered, and the men that [were] with him, (now Sha’ul [desired] abode in Giv’ah [Hill] under a tree in Ramah [Hill] , having his spear in his hand, and all his servants [were] standing about him;)"
1 Samuel,22,7,"Then Sha’ul [desired] said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, you 2f Binyamini; will the son of Yishai [I possess] give everyone of you fields and vineyards, [and] make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;"
1 Samuel,22,8,"That all of you have conspired against me, and [there is] none that shows me that my son has made a league with the son of Yishai [I possess] , and [there is] none of you that is sorry for me, or shows unto me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
1 Samuel,22,9,"Then answered Do’eg [fearing] the Edomi [red] , which was set over the servants of Sha’ul [desired] , and said, I saw the son of Yishai [I possess] coming to Nov [high place] , to Achi-Melekh [my brother is king] the son of Achituv [my brother is good]."
1 Samuel,22,10,"And he enquired of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) for him, and gave him victuals (food for humans) , and gave him the sword of Golyat [splendor] the P’lishtim [immigrants]."
1 Samuel,22,11,"Then the king sent to call Achi-Melekh [my brother is king] the priest, the son of Achituv [my brother is good] , and all his father’s house, the priests that [were] in Nov [high place] : and they came all of them to the king."
1 Samuel,22,12,"And Sha’ul [desired] said, Hear now, you i son of Achituv [my brother is good] . And he answered, Here I [am] , my lord."
1 Samuel,22,13,"And Sha’ul [desired] said unto him, Why have you 2f conspired against me, you i and the son of Yishai [I possess] , in that you i have given him bread, and a sword, and have enquired of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
1 Samuel,22,14,"Then Achi-Melekh [my brother is king] answered the king, and said, And who [is so] faithful among all your i servants as David [beloved] , which is the king’s son in law, and goes at you i bidding, and is honourable in your i house?"
1 Samuel,22,15,"Did I then begin to enquire of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] for him? be it far from me: let not the king impiute (charge to one’s account; reckon) [any] thing unto his servant, [nor] to all the house of my father: for you i servant knew nothing of all this, less or more."
1 Samuel,22,16,"And the king said, you i shall surely die, Achi-Melekh [my brother is king] , you i , and all your i father’s house."
1 Samuel,22,17,"And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; because their hand also [is] with David [beloved] , and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,22,18,"And the king said to Do’eg [fearing] , Turn you i , and fall upon the priests. And Do’eg [fearing] the Edomi [red] turned, and he fell upon the priests, and killed on that day eighty and five persons that did wear a linen ephod (vest)."
1 Samuel,22,19,"And Nov [high place] , the city of the priests, struck he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword."
1 Samuel,22,20,"And one of the sons of Achi-Melekh [my brother is king] the son of Achituv [my brother is good] , named Avyatar [my father is great] , escaped, and fled after David [beloved]."
1 Samuel,22,21,And Avyatar [my father is great] showed David [beloved] that Sha’ul [desired] had slain the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] priests.
1 Samuel,22,22,"And David [beloved] said unto Avyatar [my father is great] , I knew [it] that day, when Do’eg [fearing] the Edomi [red] [was] there, that he would surely tell Sha’ul [desired] : I have occasioned [the death] of all the persons of you i father’s house."
1 Samuel,22,23,"Abide you i with me, fear not: for he that seeks my life seeks you i life: but with me you i [shall be] in safeguard."
1 Samuel,23,1,"Then they told David [beloved] , saying, Behold, the P’lishtim [Immigrants] fight against Ke’ilah [Fortress] , and they rob the threshing floors."
1 Samuel,23,2,"Therefore David [beloved] enquired of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, Shall I go and strike these P’lishtim [Immigrants] ? And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto David [beloved] , Go, and strike the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and save Ke’ilah [Fortress]."
1 Samuel,23,3,"And David’s [beloved] ’s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] : how much more then if we come to Ke’ilah [Fortress] against the armies of the P’lishtim [Immigrants]?"
1 Samuel,23,4,"Then David [beloved] enquired of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) yet again. And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) answered him and said, Arise, go down to Ke’ilah [Fortress] ; for I will deliver the P’lishtim [Immigrants] into you i hand."
1 Samuel,23,5,"So David [beloved] and his men went to Ke’ilah [Fortress] , and fought with the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and brought away their cattle, and struck them with a great slaughter. So David [beloved] saved the inhabitants of Ke’ilah [Fortress]."
1 Samuel,23,6,"And it came to pass, when Avyatar [my father is great] the son of Achi-Melekh [my brother is king] fled to David [beloved] to Ke’ilah [Fortress], [that] he came down [with] an ephod (vest) in his hand."
1 Samuel,23,7,"And it was told Sha’ul [desired] that David [beloved] was come to Ke’ilah [Fortress] . And Sha’ul [desired] said, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that has gates and bars."
1 Samuel,23,8,"And Sha’ul [desired] called all the people together to war, to go down to Ke’ilah [Fortress] , to besiege David [beloved] and his men."
1 Samuel,23,9,"And David [beloved] knew that Sha’ul [desired] secretly practiced mischief against him; and he said to Avyatar [my father is great] the priest, Bring here the ephod (vest)."
1 Samuel,23,10,"Then said David [beloved] , O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , you i servant has certainly heard that Sha’ul [desired] seeks to come to Ke’ilah [Fortress] , to destroy the city for my sake."
1 Samuel,23,11,"Will the men of Ke’ilah [Fortress] deliver me up into his hand? will Sha’ul [desired] come down, as your i servant has heard? O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , tell your i servant. And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, He will come down."
1 Samuel,23,12,"Then said David [beloved] , Will the men of Ke’ilah [Fortress] deliver me and my men into the hand of Sha’ul [desired] ? And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, They will deliver [you i ] up."
1 Samuel,23,13,"Then David [beloved] and his men, [which were] about six hundred, arose and departed out of Ke’ilah [Fortress] , and went to wherever they could go. And it was told Sha’ul [desired] that David [beloved] was escaped from Ke’ilah [Fortress] ; and he forbare to go forth."
1 Samuel,23,14,"And David [beloved] abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziv [brightness] [Battlement (low wall around a roof; wall for defense)]. And Sha’ul [desired] sought him every day, but God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] delivered him not into his hand."
1 Samuel,23,15,And David [beloved] saw that Sha’ul [desired] was come out to seek his life: and David [beloved] [was] in the wilderness of Ziv [brightness] [Battlement (low wall around a roof; wall for defense)] in a wood.
1 Samuel,23,16,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] Sha’ul’s [desired] son arose, and went to David [beloved] into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
1 Samuel,23,17,"And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Sha’ul [desired] my father shall not find you i ; and you i shall be king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and I shall be next unto you i ; and that also Sha’ul [desired] my father knows."
1 Samuel,23,18,"And they two made a covenant before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and David [beloved] abode in the wood, and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] went to his house."
1 Samuel,23,19,"Then came up the Zifim [smelters] to Sha’ul [desired] to Giv’ah [Hill] , saying, Does not David [beloved] hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hikhilah [dark] , which [is] on the south of Y’shim’on [Wasteland]?"
1 Samuel,23,20,"Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of you i soul to come down; and our part [shall be] to deliver him into the king’s hand."
1 Samuel,23,21,"And Sha’ul [desired] said, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] you 2f of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; for you 2f have compassion on me."
1 Samuel,23,22,"Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt (where one goes freequently) is, [and] who has seen him there: for it is told me [that] he deals very subtly."
1 Samuel,23,23,"See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come you 2f again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
1 Samuel,23,24,"And they arose, and went to Ziv [brightness] [Battlement (low wall around a roof; wall for defense)] before Sha’ul [desired] : but David [beloved] and his men [were] in the wilderness of Ma’on [Habitation] , in the plain on the south of Y’shim’on [Wasteland]."
1 Samuel,23,25,"Sha’ul [desired] also and his men went to seek [him] . And they told David [beloved] : wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Ma’on [Habitation] . And when Sha’ul [desired] heard [that] , he pursued after David [beloved] in the wilderness of Ma’on [Habitation]."
1 Samuel,23,26,"And Sha’ul [desired] went on this side of the mountain, and David [beloved] and his men on that side of the mountain: and David [beloved] made haste to get away for fear of Sha’ul [desired] ; for Sha’ul [desired] and his men compassed David [beloved] and his men round about to take them."
1 Samuel,23,27,"But there came a messenger unto Sha’ul [desired] , saying, Haste you i , and come; for the P’lishtim [Immigrants] have invaded the land."
1 Samuel,23,28,"For what reason Sha’ul [desired] returned from pursuing after David [beloved] , and went against the P’lishtim [Immigrants] : therefore they called that place Sela [the rocks] -Hamachlekot [the cliff of escapes, or divisions]."
1 Samuel,23,29,"And David [beloved] went up from there, and dwelt in strong holds at ‘Ein-Gedi [Fount of the Kid]."
1 Samuel,24,1,"And it came to pass, when Sha’ul [desired] was returned from following the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , that it was told him, saying, Behold, David [beloved] [is] in the wilderness of ‘Ein-Gedi [Fount of the Kid]."
1 Samuel,24,2,"Then Sha’ul [desired] took three thousand chosen men out of all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and went to seek David [beloved] and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats."
1 Samuel,24,3,"And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where [was] a cave; and Sha’ul [desired] went in to cover his feet: and David [beloved] and his men remained in the sides of the cave."
1 Samuel,24,4,"And the men of David [beloved] said unto him, Behold the day of which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto you i , Behold, I will deliver you i enemy into you i hand, that you i may do to him as it shall seem good unto you i . Then David [beloved] arose, and cut off the skirt of Sha’ul’s [desired] robe privately."
1 Samuel,24,5,"And it came to pass afterward, that David’s [beloved] ’s heart struck him, because he had cut off Sha’ul’s [desired] skirt."
1 Samuel,24,6,"And he said unto his men, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, seeing he [is] the anointed of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Samuel,24,7,"So David [beloved] detained (held) his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Sha’ul [desired] . But Sha’ul [desired] rose up out of the cave, and went on [his] way."
1 Samuel,24,8,"David [beloved] also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Sha’ul [desired] , saying, My lord the king. And when Sha’ul [desired] looked behind him, David [beloved] stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself."
1 Samuel,24,9,"And David [beloved] said to Sha’ul [desired] , For what reason hear you i men’s words, saying, Behold, David [beloved] seeks you i hurt?"
1 Samuel,24,10,"Behold, this day you i eyes have seen how that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had delivered you i to day into my hand in the cave: and [some] bade [me] kill you i : but [my eye] spared you i ; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he [is] the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] anointed."
1 Samuel,24,11,"Moreover, my father, see, yes, see the skirt of you i robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of you i robe, and killed you i not, know you i and see that [there is] neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against you i ; yet you i hunt my soul to take it."
1 Samuel,24,12,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) judge between me and you i , and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) avenge me of you i : but my hand shall not be upon you i."
1 Samuel,24,13,"As says the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceeds from the wicked: but my hand shall not be upon you i."
1 Samuel,24,14,"After whom is the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] come out? after whom do you i pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea."
1 Samuel,24,15,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) therefore be judge, and judge between me and you i , and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of you i hand."
1 Samuel,24,16,"And it came to pass, when David [beloved] had made an end of speaking these words unto Sha’ul [desired] , that Sha’ul [desired] said, [Is] this you i voice, my son David [beloved] ? And Sha’ul [desired] lifted up his voice, and wept."
1 Samuel,24,17,"And he said to David [beloved] , you i [are] more righteous than I: for you i have rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded you i evil."
1 Samuel,24,18,"And you i have showed this day how that you i have dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had delivered me into you i hand, you i killed me not."
1 Samuel,24,19,"For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) reward you i good for that you i have done unto me this day."
1 Samuel,24,20,"And now, behold, I know well that you i shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall be established in your i hand."
1 Samuel,24,21,"Swear now therefore unto me by the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that you i will not cut off my seed after me, and that you i will not destroy my name out of my father’s house."
1 Samuel,24,22,And David [beloved] swore unto Sha’ul [desired] . And Sha’ul [desired] went home; but David [beloved] and his men got them up unto the hold.
1 Samuel,25,1,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] died; and all the Yisra’eli’s were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah [Hill] . And David [beloved] arose, and went down to the wilderness of Pa’ran [place of caverns]."
1 Samuel,25,2,"And [there was] a man in Ma’on [Habitation] , whose possessions [were] in Carmel [Garden-land] ; and the man [was] very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel [Garden-land]."
1 Samuel,25,3,"Now the name of the man [was] Naval [fool] ; and the name of his wife Avigayil [my father is joy] : and [she was] a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor): but the man [was] churlish and evil in his doings; and he [was] of the house of Kalev [Dog]."
1 Samuel,25,4,And David [beloved] heard in the wilderness that Naval [fool] did shear his sheep.
1 Samuel,25,5,"And David [beloved] sent out ten young men, and David [beloved] said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel [Garden-land] , and go to Naval [fool] , and greet him in my name:"
1 Samuel,25,6,"And thus shall you 2f say to him that lives [in prosperity] , Peace [be] both to you i , and peace [be] to your i house, and peace [be] unto all that you i have."
1 Samuel,25,7,"And now I have heard that you i have shearers: now your i shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel [Garden-land]."
1 Samuel,25,8,"Ask you i young men, and they will show you i . For what reason let the young men find favour in you i eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray you i , whatsoever comes to your i hand unto your i servants, and to your i son David [beloved]."
1 Samuel,25,9,"And when David’s [beloved] ’s young men came, they spoke to Naval [fool] according to all those words in the name of David [beloved] , and ceased."
1 Samuel,25,10,"And Naval [fool] answered David’s [beloved] ’s servants, and said, Who [is] David [beloved] ? and who [is] the son of Yishai [I possess] ? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master."
1 Samuel,25,11,"Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give [it] unto men, whom I know not from what place they [be]?"
1 Samuel,25,12,"So David’s [beloved] ’s young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings."
1 Samuel,25,13,"And David [beloved] said unto his men, Gird you 2f on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David [beloved] also girded on his sword: and there went up after David [beloved] about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff."
1 Samuel,25,14,"But one of the young men told Avigayil [my father is joy] , Naval [fool] ’s wife, saying, Behold, David [beloved] sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them."
1 Samuel,25,15,"But the men [were] very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:"
1 Samuel,25,16,"They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep."
1 Samuel,25,17,"Now therefore know and consider what you i will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he [is such] a son of Belial [Worthless, Good for Nothing] , that [a man] cannot speak to him."
1 Samuel,25,18,"Then Avigayil [my father is joy] made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched [corn] , and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid [them] on asses."
1 Samuel,25,19,"And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Naval [fool]."
1 Samuel,25,20,"And it was [so, as] she rode on the ass, that she came down by the colonnade of the hill, and, behold, David [beloved] and his men came down against her; and she met them."
1 Samuel,25,21,"Now David [beloved] had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this [fellow] has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that [pertained] unto him: and he has requited me evil for good."
1 Samuel,25,22,"So and more also do God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] unto the enemies of David [beloved] , if I leave of all that [pertain] to him by the morning light any that pisses against the wall."
1 Samuel,25,23,"And when Avigayil [my father is joy] saw David [beloved] , she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David [beloved] on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,"
1 Samuel,25,24,"And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, [upon] me [let this] iniquity [be] : and let you i female servant, I pray you i , speak in you i audience, and hear the words of you i female servant."
1 Samuel,25,25,"Let not my lord, I pray you i , regard this man of Belial [Worthless, Good for Nothing], [even] Naval [fool] : for as his name [is] , so [is] he; Naval [fool] [is] his name, and folly [is] with him: but I you i female servant saw not the young men of my lord, whom you i did send."
1 Samuel,25,26,"Now therefore, my lord, [as] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, and [as] your i soul lives, seeing the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has withheld you i from coming to [shed] blood, and from avenging yourself with your i own hand, now let your i enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Naval [fool]."
1 Samuel,25,27,"And now this blessing which you i female servant has brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord."
1 Samuel,25,28,"I pray you i , forgive the trespass of your i female servant: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fights the battles of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and evil has not been found in you i [all] your i days."
1 Samuel,25,29,"Yet a man is risen to pursue you i , and to seek your i soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; and the souls of your i enemies, them shall he sling out, [as out] of the middle of a sling."
1 Samuel,25,30,"And it shall come to pass, when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you i , and shall have appointed you i ruler over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God];"
1 Samuel,25,31,"That this shall be no grief unto you i , nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that you i have shed blood causeless, or that my lord has avenged himself: but when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember you i female servant."
1 Samuel,25,32,"And David [beloved] said to Avigayil [my father is joy] , Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which sent you i this day to meet me:"
1 Samuel,25,33,"And Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] you i advice, and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] you i , which have kept me this day from coming to [shed] blood, and from avenging myself with my own hand."
1 Samuel,25,34,"For in very deed, [as] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] lives, which has kept me back from hurting you i , except you i had hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Naval [fool] by the morning light any that pisses against the wall."
1 Samuel,25,35,"So David [beloved] received of her hand [that] which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to you i house; see, I have listened to you i voice, and have accepted you i person."
1 Samuel,25,36,"And Avigayil [my father is joy] came to Naval [fool] ; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Naval [fool] ’s heart [was] merry within him, for he [was] very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light."
1 Samuel,25,37,"But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Naval [fool] , and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became [as] a stone."
1 Samuel,25,38,"And it came to pass about ten days [after] , that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) struck Naval [fool] , that he died."
1 Samuel,25,39,"And when David [beloved] heard that Naval [fool] was dead, he said, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that has pleaded the cause of my reproach (disgrace; shame) from the hand of Naval [fool] , and has kept his servant from evil: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has returned the wickedness of Naval [fool] upon his own head. And David [beloved] sent and communed with Avigayil [my father is joy] , to take her to him to wife."
1 Samuel,25,40,"And when the servants of David [beloved] were come to Avigayil [my father is joy] to Carmel [Garden-land] , they spoke unto her, saying, David [beloved] sent us unto you i , to take you i to him to wife."
1 Samuel,25,41,"And she arose, and bowed herself on [her] face to the earth, and said, Behold, [let] your i female servant [be] a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord."
1 Samuel,25,42,"And Avigayil [my father is joy] hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five female servants of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David [beloved] , and became his wife."
1 Samuel,25,43,David [beloved] also took Achino’am [my brother is delight] of Yizre’el [God Sows] ; and they were also both of them his wives.
1 Samuel,25,44,"But Sha’ul [desired] had given Mikhal [who is like God?] his daughter, David’s [beloved] ’s wife, to Palti [my deliverance] the son of Layish [Lion] , which [was] of Gallim [springs]."
1 Samuel,26,1,"And the Zifim [smelters] came unto Sha’ul [desired] to Giv’ah [Hill] , saying, Does not David [beloved] hide himself in the hill of Hikhilah [dark], [which is] before Y’shim’on [Wasteland]?"
1 Samuel,26,2,"Then Sha’ul [desired] arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziv [brightness] [Battlement (low wall around a roof; wall for defense)] , having three thousand chosen men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with him, to seek David [beloved] in the wilderness of Ziv [brightness] [Battlement (low wall around a roof; wall for defense)]."
1 Samuel,26,3,"And Sha’ul [desired] pitched in the hill of Hikhilah [dark] , which [is] before Y’shim’on [Wasteland] , by the way. But David [beloved] abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Sha’ul [desired] came after him into the wilderness."
1 Samuel,26,4,"David [beloved] therefore sent out spies, and understood that Sha’ul [desired] was come in very deed."
1 Samuel,26,5,"And David [beloved] arose, and came to the place where Sha’ul [desired] had pitched: and David [beloved] beheld the place where Sha’ul [desired] lay, and Avner [my father is a lamp] the son of Ner [lamp] , the captain of his host: and Sha’ul [desired] lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him."
1 Samuel,26,6,"Then answered David [beloved] and said to Achi-Melekh [my brother is king] the Hitti [Terrorists] , and to Avishai [my father is a gift] the son of Tz’ruyah [balsam] , brother to Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , saying, Who will go down with me to Sha’ul [desired] to the camp? And Avishai [my father is a gift] said, I will go down with you i."
1 Samuel,26,7,"So David [beloved] and Avishai [my father is a gift] came to the people by night: and, behold, Sha’ul [desired] lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster (pillow; head - or other - support) : but Avner [my father is a lamp] and the people lay round about him."
1 Samuel,26,8,"Then said Avishai [my father is a gift] to David [beloved] , God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has delivered you i enemy into you i hand this day: now therefore let me strike him, I pray you i , with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not [strike] him the second time."
1 Samuel,26,9,"And David [beloved] said to Avishai [my father is a gift] , Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] anointed, and be guiltless?"
1 Samuel,26,10,"David [beloved] said furthermore, [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall strike him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish."
1 Samuel,26,11,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] anointed: but, I pray you i , take you i now the spear that [is] at his bolster (pillow; head - or other - support) , and the pot of water, and let us go."
1 Samuel,26,12,"So David [beloved] took the spear and the pot of water from Sha’ul’s [desired] bolster (pillow; head - or other - support) ; and they got them away, and no man saw [it] , nor knew [it] , neither awakened: for they [were] all asleep; because a deep sleep from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was fallen upon them."
1 Samuel,26,13,"Then David [beloved] went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space [being] between them:"
1 Samuel,26,14,"And David [beloved] cried to the people, and to Avner [my father is a lamp] the son of Ner [lamp] , saying, Answer you i not, Avner [my father is a lamp] ? Then Avner [my father is a lamp] answered and said, Who [are] you i [that] cries to the king?"
1 Samuel,26,15,"And David [beloved] said to Avner [my father is a lamp], [Are] not you i a [valiant] man? and who [is] like to you i in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ? wherefore then have you i not kept you i lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king you i lord."
1 Samuel,26,16,"This thing [is] not good that you i have done. [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, you 2f [are] worthy to die, because you 2f have not kept your master, the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] anointed. And now see where the king’s spear [is] , and the pot of water that [was] at his bolster (pillow; head - or other - support)."
1 Samuel,26,17,"And Sha’ul [desired] knew David’s [beloved] ’s voice, and said, [Is] this you i voice, my son David [beloved] ? And David [beloved] said, [It is] my voice, my lord, O king."
1 Samuel,26,18,"And he said, For what reason does my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil [is] in my hand?"
1 Samuel,26,19,"Now therefore, I pray you i , let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have stirred you i up against me, let him accept an offering: but if [they be] the children of men, cursed [be] they before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, Go, serve other gods."
1 Samuel,26,20,"Now therefore, let not my blood fall to (to do entirely, do wholly) the earth before the face of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : for the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] is come out to seek a flea, as when one does hunt a partridge in the mountains."
1 Samuel,26,21,"Then said Sha’ul [desired] , I have sinned: return, my son David [beloved] : for I will no more do you i harm, because my soul was precious in your i eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly."
1 Samuel,26,22,"And David [beloved] answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it."
1 Samuel,26,23,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) delivered you i into [my] hand to day, but I would not stretch forth my hand against the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] anointed."
1 Samuel,26,24,"And, behold, as your i life was much set by this day in my eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and let him deliver me out of all tribulation."
1 Samuel,26,25,"Then Sha’ul [desired] said to David [beloved] , Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] you i , my son David [beloved] : you i shall both do great [things] , and also shall still prevail. So David [beloved] went on his way, and Sha’ul [desired] returned to his place."
1 Samuel,27,1,"And David [beloved] said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Sha’ul [desired]: [there is] nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] ; and Sha’ul [desired] shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : so shall I escape out of his hand."
1 Samuel,27,2,"And David [beloved] arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that [were] with him unto Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man], the son of Ma’okh [oppression] , king of Gat [Winepress]."
1 Samuel,27,3,"And David [beloved] dwelt with Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man] at Gat [Winepress] , he and his men, every man with his household, [even] David [beloved] with his two wives, Achino’am [my brother is delight] the Yizre’elit [God Sows] , and Avigayil [my father is joy] the Carmelit [garden-land] , Naval [fool] ’s wife."
1 Samuel,27,4,And it was told Sha’ul [desired] that David [beloved] was fled to Gat [Winepress] : and he sought no more again for him.
1 Samuel,27,5,"And David [beloved] said unto Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man] , If I have now found grace in you i eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should you i servant dwell in the royal city with you i?"
1 Samuel,27,6,Then Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man] gave him Ziklag [Winding] that day: wherefore Ziklag [Winding] pertains unto the kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] unto this day.
1 Samuel,27,7,And the time that David [beloved] dwelt in the country of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] was a full year and four months.
1 Samuel,27,8,"And David [beloved] and his men went up, and invaded the G’shuri [A Bridge] , and the Gizri [bridge] , and the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley] : for those [nations were] of old the inhabitants of the land, as you i go to Shur [wall] , even unto the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
1 Samuel,27,9,"And David [beloved] struck the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man]."
1 Samuel,27,10,"And Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man] said, Where have you 2f made a raid to day? And David [beloved] said, Against the south of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and against the south of the Yerachme’eli [my God have pity] , and against the south of the Keini [traveling tinkers or blacksmiths]."
1 Samuel,27,11,"And David [beloved] saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring [tidings] to Gat [Winepress] , saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David [beloved] , and so [will be] his manner all the while he dwells in the country of the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."
1 Samuel,27,12,"And Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man] believed David [beloved] , saying, He has made his people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant forever."
1 Samuel,28,1,"And it came to pass in those days, that the P’lishtim [Immigrants] gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] . And Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man] said unto David [beloved] , Know you i assuredly, that you i shall go out with me to battle, you i and you i men."
1 Samuel,28,2,"And David [beloved] said to Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man] , Surely you i shall know what you i servant can do. And Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man] said to David [beloved] , Therefore will I make you i keeper of my head forever."
1 Samuel,28,3,"Now Sh’mu’el [His name is El] was dead, and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah [Hill] , even in his own city. And Sha’ul [desired] had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land."
1 Samuel,28,4,"And the P’lishtim [Immigrants] gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem [Double Resting Place] : and Sha’ul [desired] gathered all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] together, and they pitched in Gilboa [swollen heap]."
1 Samuel,28,5,"And when Sha’ul [desired] saw the host of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled."
1 Samuel,28,6,"And when Sha’ul [desired] enquired of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim [Lights] , nor by prophets."
1 Samuel,28,7,"Then said Sha’ul [desired] unto his servants, Seek me a woman that has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, [there is] a woman that has a familiar spirit at ‘Ein-Dor [spring of dwelling]."
1 Samuel,28,8,"And ha’ul [desired] disguised himself, and put on other clothing, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray you i , divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me [him] up, whom I shall name unto you i."
1 Samuel,28,9,"And the woman said unto him, Behold, you i know what Sha’ul [desired] has done, how he has cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then lay you i a snare for my life, to cause me to die?"
1 Samuel,28,10,"And Sha’ul [desired] swore to her by the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, there shall no punishment happen to you i for this thing."
1 Samuel,28,11,"Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto you i ? And he said, Bring me up Sh’mu’el [His name is El]."
1 Samuel,28,12,"And when the woman saw Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spoke to Sha’ul [desired] , saying, Why have you i deceived me? for you i [are] Sha’ul [desired]."
1 Samuel,28,13,"And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what saw you i ? And the woman said unto Sha’ul [desired] , I saw gods ascending out of the earth."
1 Samuel,28,14,"And he said unto her, What form [is] he of? And she said, An old man comes up; and he [is] covered with a Mantle (cloak; covering garment) (cloak) . And Sha’ul [desired] perceived that it [was] Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , and he stooped with [his] face to the ground, and bowed himself."
1 Samuel,28,15,"And Sh’mu’el [His name is El] said to Sha’ul [desired] , Why have you i disquieted me, to bring me up? And Sha’ul [desired] answered, I am sore distressed; for the P’lishtim [Immigrants] make war against me, and God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] is departed from me, and answer me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called you i , that you i may make known unto me what I shall do."
1 Samuel,28,16,"Then said Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , For what reason then do you i ask of me, seeing the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) is departed from you i , and is become your i enemy?"
1 Samuel,28,17,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has done to him, as he spoke by me: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has rent the kingdom out of your i hand, and given it to your i neighbour, [even] to David [beloved]:"
1 Samuel,28,18,"Because you i obeyed not the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , nor executed his fierce wrath upon ‘Amalek [Dweller in a Valley] , therefore has the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) done this thing unto you i this day."
1 Samuel,28,19,Moreover the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will also deliver Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with you i into the hand of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] : and tomorrow [shall] you i and you i sons [be] with me: the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) also shall deliver the host of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] into the hand of the P’lishtim [Immigrants].
1 Samuel,28,20,"Then Sha’ul [desired] fell immediately all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Sh’mu’el [His name is El] : and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night."
1 Samuel,28,21,"And the woman came unto Sha’ul [desired] , and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, your i female servant has obeyed your i voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened unto your i words which you i spoke unto me."
1 Samuel,28,22,"Now therefore, I pray you i , hearken you i also unto the voice of your i female servant, and let me set a morsel of bread before you i ; and eat, that you i may have strength, when you i go on you i way."
1 Samuel,28,23,"But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he listened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed."
1 Samuel,28,24,"And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded [it] , and did bake unleavened bread thereof:"
1 Samuel,28,25,"And she brought [it] before Sha’ul [desired] , and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night."
1 Samuel,29,1,Now the P’lishtim [Immigrants] gathered together all their armies to Aphek [Enclosure] : and the Yisra’eli’s pitched by a fountain which [is] in Yizre’el [God Sows].
1 Samuel,29,2,"And the lords of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David [beloved] and his men passed on in the rear guard with Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man]."
1 Samuel,29,3,"Then said the princes of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , What [do] these ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] [here] ? And Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man] said unto the princes of the P’lishtim [Immigrants], [Is] not this David [beloved] , the servant of Sha’ul [desired] the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which has been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell [unto me] unto this day?"
1 Samuel,29,4,"And the princes of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] were exceedingly angry with him; and the princes of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which you i have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for which should he reconcile himself unto his master? [should it] not [be] with the heads of these men?"
