Jonah,1,1,"Now the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto Yonah [dove] the son of Amitai [my truth] , saying,"
Jonah,1,2,"Arise, go to Nineveh [abode of Ninus, or Offspring’s Habitation] , that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me."
Jonah,1,3,"But Yonah [dove] rose up to flee unto Tarshish [yellow jasper] from the presence of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish [yellow jasper] : so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish [yellow jasper] from the presence of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Jonah,1,4,"But the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken."
Jonah,1,5,"Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that [were] in the ship into the sea, to lighten [it] of them. But Yonah [dove] was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep."
Jonah,1,6,"So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What mean you i , O sleeper? arise, call upon your i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , if so be that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] will think upon us, that we perish not."
Jonah,1,7,"And they said everyone to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil [is] upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Yonah [dove]."
Jonah,1,8,"Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray you i , for whose cause is this evil upon us; What [is] your i occupation? and from what place come you i ? what [is] your i country? and of what people [are] you i?"
Jonah,1,9,"And he said unto them, I [am] an ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] ; and I fear the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of heaven, which has made the sea and the dry [land]."
Jonah,1,10,"Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why have you i done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , because he had told them."
Jonah,1,11,"Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto you i , that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous."
Jonah,1,12,"And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest [is] upon you."
Jonah,1,13,"Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring [it] to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them."
Jonah,1,14,"For what reason they cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, We beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , we beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for you i , O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , have done as it pleased you i."
Jonah,1,15,"So they took up Yonah [dove] , and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging."
Jonah,1,16,"Then the men feared the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and made vows."
Jonah,1,17,"Now the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had prepared a great fish to swallow (to approve, commend, accept) up Yonah [dove] . And Yonah [dove] was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights."
Jonah,2,1,"Then Yonah [dove] prayed unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] out of the fish’s belly,"
Jonah,2,2,"And said, I cried by reason of my affliction unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, [and] you i heard my voice."
Jonah,2,3,"For you i had cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all your i billows and your i waves passed over me."
Jonah,2,4,"Then I said, I am cast out of your i sight; yet I will look again toward your i holy temple."
Jonah,2,5,"The waters compassed me about, [even] to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head."
Jonah,2,6,"I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars [was] about me forever: yet have you i brought up my life from corruption, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Jonah,2,7,"When my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and my prayer came in unto you i , into your i holy temple."
Jonah,2,8,They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
Jonah,2,9,But I will sacrifice unto you i with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay [that] that I have vowed. Salvation [is] of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
Jonah,2,10,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Yonah [dove] upon the dry [land]."
Jonah,3,1,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto Yonah [dove] the second time, saying,"
Jonah,3,2,"Arise, go unto Nineveh [abode of Ninus, or Offspring’s Habitation] , that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid you i."
Jonah,3,3,"So Yonah [dove] arose, and went unto Nineveh [abode of Ninus, or Offspring’s Habitation] , according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . Now Nineveh [abode of Ninus, or Offspring’s Habitation] was an exceeding great city of three days’ journey."
Jonah,3,4,"And Yonah [dove] began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh [abode of Ninus, or Offspring’s Habitation] shall be overthrown."
Jonah,3,5,"So the people of Nineveh [abode of Ninus, or Offspring’s Habitation] believed God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them."
Jonah,3,6,"For word came unto the king of Nineveh [abode of Ninus, or Offspring’s Habitation] , and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered [him] with sackcloth, and sat in ashes."
Jonah,3,7,"And he caused [it] to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh [abode of Ninus, or Offspring’s Habitation] by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything: let them not feed, nor drink water:"
Jonah,3,8,"But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : yes, let them turn everyone from his evil way, and from the violence that [is] in their hands."
Jonah,3,9,"Who can tell [if] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?"
Jonah,3,10,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did [it] not."
Jonah,4,1,"But it displeased Yonah [dove] exceedingly, and he was very angry."
Jonah,4,2,"And he prayed unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, I pray you i , O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [was] not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish [yellow jasper] : for I knew that you i [are] a gracious God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repent you i of the evil."
Jonah,4,3,"Therefore now, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , take, I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , my life from me; for [it is] better for me to die than to live."
Jonah,4,4,"Then said the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Do you i well to be angry?"
Jonah,4,5,"So Yonah [dove] went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city."
Jonah,4,6,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] prepared a gourd, and made [it] to come up over Yonah [dove] , that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Yonah [dove] was exceeding glad of the gourd."
Jonah,4,7,"But God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it struck the gourd that it withered."
Jonah,4,8,"And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] prepared a vehement (violent; forceful; furious) east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Yonah [dove] , that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, [It is] better for me to die than to live."
Jonah,4,9,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] said to Yonah [dove] , Do you i well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, [even] unto death."
Jonah,4,10,"Then said the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , you i have had pity on the gourd, for the which you i have not laboured, neither made it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:"
Jonah,4,11,"And should not I spare Nineveh [abode of Ninus, or Offspring’s Habitation] , that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and [also] much cattle?"
