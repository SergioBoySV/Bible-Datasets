Ecclesiastes,1,1,"The words of the Preacher, the son of David [beloved] , king in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Ecclesiastes,1,2,"Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all [is] vanity."
Ecclesiastes,1,3,What profit has a man of all his labour which he takes under the sun?
Ecclesiastes,1,4," [One] generation passes away, and [another] generation comes: but the earth abides forever."
Ecclesiastes,1,5,"The sun also arises, and the sun goes down, and hastes to his place where he arose."
Ecclesiastes,1,6,"The wind goes toward the south, and turns about unto the north; it whirls about continually, and the wind returns again according to his circuits."
Ecclesiastes,1,7,"All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea [is] not full; unto the place from what place the rivers come, there they return again."
Ecclesiastes,1,8,"All things [are] full of labour; man cannot utter [it] : the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing."
Ecclesiastes,1,9,"The thing that has been, it [is that] which shall be; and that which is done [is] that which shall be done: and [there is] no new [thing] under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,1,10,"Is there [any] thing whereof it may be said, See, this [is] new? it has been already of old time, which was before us."
Ecclesiastes,1,11, [There is] no remembrance of former [things] ; neither shall there be [any] remembrance of [things] that are to come with [those] that shall come after.
Ecclesiastes,1,12,I the Preacher was king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace].
Ecclesiastes,1,13,And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all [things] that are done under heaven: this sore travail has God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] given to the sons of man to be exercised with that.
Ecclesiastes,1,14,"I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all [is] vanity and anguish of spirit."
Ecclesiastes,1,15, [That which is] crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
Ecclesiastes,1,16,"I communed with my own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all [they] that have been before me in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : yes, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."
Ecclesiastes,1,17,"And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is anguish of spirit."
Ecclesiastes,1,18,For in much wisdom [is] much grief: and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow.
Ecclesiastes,2,1,"I said in my heart, Go to now, I will prove you i with gladness, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also [is] vanity."
Ecclesiastes,2,2,"I said of laughter, [It is] mad: and of gladness, What does it?"
Ecclesiastes,2,3,"I sought in my heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting my heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what [was] that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life."
Ecclesiastes,2,4,I made me great works; I built me houses; I planted me vineyards:
Ecclesiastes,2,5,"I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all [kind of] fruits:"
Ecclesiastes,2,6,"I made me pools of water, to water with that the wood that brings forth trees:"
Ecclesiastes,2,7,"I got [me] servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] before me:"
Ecclesiastes,2,8,"I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar (particular; special; one’s own) treasure of kings and of the provinces: I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, [as] musical instruments, and that of all sorts."
Ecclesiastes,2,9,"So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : also my wisdom remained with me."
Ecclesiastes,2,10,"And whatsoever my eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour."
Ecclesiastes,2,11,"Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all [was] vanity and anguish of spirit, and [there was] no profit under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,2,12,"And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what [can] the man [do] that comes after the king? [even] that which has been already done."
Ecclesiastes,2,13,"Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness."
Ecclesiastes,2,14,The wise man’s eyes [are] in his head; but the fool walks in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happens to them all.
Ecclesiastes,2,15,"Then said I in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so it happens even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also [is] vanity."
Ecclesiastes,2,16,For [there is] no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever; seeing that which now [is] in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dies the wise [man] ? as the fool.
Ecclesiastes,2,17,Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun [is] grievous unto me: for all [is] vanity and anguish of spirit.
Ecclesiastes,2,18,"Yes, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me."
Ecclesiastes,2,19,"And who knows whether he shall be a wise [man] or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This [is] also vanity."
Ecclesiastes,2,20,Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.
Ecclesiastes,2,21,"For there is a man whose labour [is] in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that has not laboured in it shall he leave it [for] his portion. This also [is] vanity and a great evil."
Ecclesiastes,2,22,"For what has man of all his labour, and of the anguish of his heart, wherein he has laboured under the sun?"
Ecclesiastes,2,23,"For all his days [are] sorrows, and his travail grief; yes, his heart takes not rest in the night. This is also vanity."
Ecclesiastes,2,24," [There is] nothing better for a man, [than] that he should eat and drink, and [that] he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it [was] from the hand of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ecclesiastes,2,25,"For who can eat, or who else can hasten [hereunto] , more than I?"
Ecclesiastes,2,26,"For [God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ] gives to a man that [is] good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to [him that is] good before God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] . This also [is] vanity and anguish of spirit."
Ecclesiastes,3,1,"To every [thing there is] a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:"
Ecclesiastes,3,2,"A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up [that which is] planted;"
Ecclesiastes,3,3,"A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;"
Ecclesiastes,3,4,"A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;"
Ecclesiastes,3,5,"A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;"
Ecclesiastes,3,6,"A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;"
Ecclesiastes,3,7,"A time to rend (tear apart; forcefully rip apart) , and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;"
Ecclesiastes,3,8,"A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace."
Ecclesiastes,3,9,What profit has he that works in that wherein he laboureth?
Ecclesiastes,3,10,"I have seen the travail, which God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has given to the sons of men to be exercised in it."
Ecclesiastes,3,11,"He has made every [thing] beautiful in his time: also he has set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] makes from the beginning to the end."
Ecclesiastes,3,12,"I know that [there is] no good in them, but for [a man] to rejoice, and to do good in his life."
Ecclesiastes,3,13,"And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it [is] the gift of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ecclesiastes,3,14,"I know that, whatsoever God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] does, it shall be forever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] does [it] , that [men] should fear before him."
Ecclesiastes,3,15,That which has been is now; and that which is to be has already been; and God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] requires that which is past.
Ecclesiastes,3,16,"And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, [that] wickedness [was] there; and the place of righteousness, [that] iniquity [was] there."
Ecclesiastes,3,17,"I said in my heart, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for [there is] a time there for every purpose and for every work."
Ecclesiastes,3,18,"I said in my heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts."
Ecclesiastes,3,19,"For that which befalls the sons of men befalls beasts; even one thing befalls them: as the one dies, so dies the other; yes, they have all one breath; so that a man has no preeminence above a beast: for all [is] vanity."
Ecclesiastes,3,20,"All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again."
Ecclesiastes,3,21,"Who knows the spirit of man that goes upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to the earth?"
Ecclesiastes,3,22,"For what reason I perceive that [there is] nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that [is] his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?"
Ecclesiastes,4,1,"So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of [such as were] oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors [there was] power; but they had no comforter."
Ecclesiastes,4,2,For what reason I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.
Ecclesiastes,4,3,"Yes, better [is he] than both they, which has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,4,4,"Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This [is] also vanity and anguish of spirit."
Ecclesiastes,4,5,"The fool folds his hands together, and eats his own flesh."
Ecclesiastes,4,6,"Better [is] an handful [with] quietness, than both the hands full [with] travail and anguish of spirit."
Ecclesiastes,4,7,"Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,4,8,"There is one [alone] , and [there is] not a second; yes, he has neither child nor brother: yet [is there] no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither [says he] , For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This [is] also vanity, yes, it [is] a sore travail."
Ecclesiastes,4,9,Two [are] better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.
Ecclesiastes,4,10,"For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him [that is] alone when he falls; for [he has] not another to help him up."
Ecclesiastes,4,11,"Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm [alone]?"
Ecclesiastes,4,12,"And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken."
Ecclesiastes,4,13,"Better [is] a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished."
Ecclesiastes,4,14,For out of prison he comes to reign; whereas also [he that is] born in his kingdom becomes poor.
Ecclesiastes,4,15,"I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead."
Ecclesiastes,4,16," [There is] no end of all the people, [even] of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also [is] vanity and anguish of spirit."
Ecclesiastes,5,1,"Keep you i foot when you i go to the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil."
Ecclesiastes,5,2,"Be not rash with you i mouth, and let not you i heart be hasty to utter [any] thing before God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : for God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is] in heaven, and you i upon earth: therefore let you i words be few."
Ecclesiastes,5,3,For a dream comes through the multitude of business; and a fool’s voice [is known] by multitude of words.
Ecclesiastes,5,4,"When you i vow a vow unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , defer not to pay it; for [he has] no pleasure in fools: pay that which you i have vowed."
Ecclesiastes,5,5,"Better [is it] that you i should not vow, than that you i should vow and not pay."
Ecclesiastes,5,6,"Suffer not you i mouth to cause you i flesh to sin; neither say you i before the angel, that it [was] an error: wherefore should God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] be angry at you i voice, and destroy the work of you i hands?"
Ecclesiastes,5,7,For in the multitude of dreams and many words [there are] also [diverse] vanities: but fear you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered].
Ecclesiastes,5,8,"If you i see the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for [he that is] higher than the highest regards; and [there be] higher than they."
Ecclesiastes,5,9,Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king [himself] is served by the field.
Ecclesiastes,5,10,He that loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loves abundance with increase: this [is] also vanity.
Ecclesiastes,5,11,"When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good [is there] to the owners thereof, saving the beholding [of them] with their eyes?"
Ecclesiastes,5,12,"The sleep of a labouring man [is] sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep."
Ecclesiastes,5,13,"There is a sore evil [which] I have seen under the sun, [namely] , riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt."
Ecclesiastes,5,14,"But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begets a son, and [there is] nothing in his hand."
Ecclesiastes,5,15,"As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand."
Ecclesiastes,5,16,"And this also [is] a sore evil, [that] in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit has he that has laboured for the wind?"
Ecclesiastes,5,17,"All his days also he eats in darkness, and [he has] much sorrow and wrath with his sickness."
Ecclesiastes,5,18,"Behold [that] which I have seen: [it is] good and comely (attractive; proper (one’s own; peculiar; particular); becoming) [for one] to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he takes under the sun all the days of his life, which God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] gives him: for it [is] his portion."
Ecclesiastes,5,19,"Every man also to whom God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this [is] the gift of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ecclesiastes,5,20,For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] answer [him] in the joy of his heart.
Ecclesiastes,6,1,"There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it [is] common among men:"
Ecclesiastes,6,2,"A man to whom God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wants nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] gives him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eats it: this [is] vanity, and it [is] an evil disease."
Ecclesiastes,6,3,"If a man beget (to be father of; be ancestor of) an hundred [children] , and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also [that] he have no burial; I say, [that] an untimely birth [is] better than he."
Ecclesiastes,6,4,"For he comes in with vanity, and departs in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness."
Ecclesiastes,6,5,"Moreover he has not seen the sun, nor known [anything] : this has more rest than the other."
Ecclesiastes,6,6,"Yes, though he live a thousand years twice [told] , yet has he seen no good: do not all go to one place?"
Ecclesiastes,6,7,"All the labour of man [is] for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled."
Ecclesiastes,6,8,"For what has the wise more than the fool? what has the poor, that knows to walk before the living?"
Ecclesiastes,6,9,Better [is] the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this [is] also vanity and anguish of spirit.
Ecclesiastes,6,10,"That which has been is named already, and it is known that it [is] man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he."
Ecclesiastes,6,11,"Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what [is] man the better?"
Ecclesiastes,6,12,"For who knows what [is] good for man in [this] life, all the days of his vain life which he spends as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?"
Ecclesiastes,7,1,A good name [is] better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one’s birth.
Ecclesiastes,7,2," [It is] better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that [is] the end of all men; and the living will lay [it] to his heart."
Ecclesiastes,7,3,"Sorrow [is] better than laughter: for by the sadness of the Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor) the heart is made better."
Ecclesiastes,7,4,The heart of the wise [is] in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools [is] in the house of gladness.
Ecclesiastes,7,5," [It is] better to hear the rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools."
Ecclesiastes,7,6,"For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so [is] the laughter of the fool: this also [is] vanity."
Ecclesiastes,7,7,Surely oppression makes a wise man mad; and a gift destroys the heart.
Ecclesiastes,7,8,Better [is] the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: [and] the patient in spirit [is] better than the proud in spirit.
Ecclesiastes,7,9,Be not hasty in you i spirit to be angry: for anger rests in the bosom of fools.
Ecclesiastes,7,10,"Say not you i , What is [the cause] that the former days were better than these? for you i do not enquire wisely concerning this."
Ecclesiastes,7,11,Wisdom [is] good with an inheritance: and [by it there is] profit to them that see the sun.
Ecclesiastes,7,12,"For wisdom [is] a defense, [and] money [is] a defense: but the excellency of knowledge [is, that] wisdom gives life to them that have it."
Ecclesiastes,7,13,"Consider the work of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : for who can make [that] straight, which he has made crooked?"
Ecclesiastes,7,14,"In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] also has set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him."
Ecclesiastes,7,15,"All [things] have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just [man] that perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked [man] that prolongs [his life] in his wickedness."
Ecclesiastes,7,16,Be not righteous over much; neither make yourself over wise: why should you i destroy yourself?
Ecclesiastes,7,17,"Be not over much wicked, neither be you i foolish: why should you i die before you i time?"
Ecclesiastes,7,18," [It is] good that you i should take hold of this; yes, also from this withdraw not you i hand: for he that fears God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shall come forth of them all."
Ecclesiastes,7,19,Wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten mighty [men] which are in the city.
Ecclesiastes,7,20,"For [there is] not a just man upon earth, that does good, and sins not."
Ecclesiastes,7,21,Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest you i hear you i servant curse you i:
Ecclesiastes,7,22,For oftentimes also you i own heart knows that you i yourself likewise have cursed others.
Ecclesiastes,7,23,"All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it [was] far from me."
Ecclesiastes,7,24,"That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?"
Ecclesiastes,7,25,"I applied my heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason [of things] , and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness [and] madness:"
Ecclesiastes,7,26,"And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart [is] snares and nets, [and] her hands [as] bands: whoso pleases God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her."
Ecclesiastes,7,27,"Behold, this have I found, says the preacher, [counting] one by one, to find out the account:"
Ecclesiastes,7,28,"Which yet my soul seeks, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found."
Ecclesiastes,7,29,"Lo, this only have I found, that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions."
Ecclesiastes,8,1,"Who [is] as the wise [man] ? and who knows the interpretation of a thing? a man’s wisdom makes his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed."
Ecclesiastes,8,2,"I [counsel you i ] to keep the king’s commandment, and [that] in regard of the oath of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ecclesiastes,8,3,Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he does whatsoever pleases him.
Ecclesiastes,8,4,"Where the word of a king [is, there is] power: and who may say unto him, What do you i?"
Ecclesiastes,8,5,Whoso keeps the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man’s heart discerns both time and judgment.
Ecclesiastes,8,6,"Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man [is] great upon him."
Ecclesiastes,8,7,For he knows not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?
Ecclesiastes,8,8, [There is] no man that has power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither [has he] power in the day of death: and [there is] no discharge in [that] war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.
Ecclesiastes,8,9,"All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: [there is] a time wherein one man rules over another to his own hurt."
Ecclesiastes,8,10,"And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this [is] also vanity."
Ecclesiastes,8,11,"Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil."
Ecclesiastes,8,12,"Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his [days] be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which fear before him:"
Ecclesiastes,8,13,"But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong [his] days, [which are] as a shadow; because he fears not before God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ecclesiastes,8,14,"There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just [men] , unto whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked [men] , to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also [is] vanity."
Ecclesiastes,8,15,"Then I commended gladness, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] gives him under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,8,16,"When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also [there is that] neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes)"
Ecclesiastes,8,17,"Then I beheld all the work of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek [it] out, yet he shall not find [it] ; yes further; though a wise [man] think to know [it] , yet shall he not be able to find [it]."
Ecclesiastes,9,1,"For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, [are] in the hand of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : no man knows either love or hatred [by] all [that is] before them."
Ecclesiastes,9,2,"All [things come] alike to all: [there is] one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrifices, and to him that sacrifices not: as [is] the good, so [is] the sinner; [and] he that swears, as [he] that fears an oath."
Ecclesiastes,9,3,"This [is] an evil among all [things] that are done under the sun, that [there is] one event unto all: yes, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness [is] in their heart while they live, and after that [they go] to the dead."
Ecclesiastes,9,4,For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
Ecclesiastes,9,5,"For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten."
Ecclesiastes,9,6,"Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion forever in any [thing] that is done under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,9,7,"Go you i way, eat you i bread with joy, and drink you i wine with a merry heart; for God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] now accepts you i works."
Ecclesiastes,9,8,Let you i garments be always white; and let you i head lack no ointment.
Ecclesiastes,9,9,"Live joyfully with the wife whom you i love all the days of the life of you i vanity, which he has given you i under the sun, all the days of you i vanity: for that [is] you i portion in [this] life, and in you i labour which you i take under the sun."
Ecclesiastes,9,10,"Whatsoever you i hand finds to do, do [it] with you i might; for [there is] no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, to which you i go."
Ecclesiastes,9,11,"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race [is] not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happens to them all."
Ecclesiastes,9,12,"For man also knows not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so [are] the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them."
Ecclesiastes,9,13,"This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it [seemed] great unto me:"
Ecclesiastes,9,14," [There was] a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:"
Ecclesiastes,9,15,"Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man."
Ecclesiastes,9,16,"Then said I, Wisdom [is] better than strength: nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom [is] despised, and his words are not heard."
Ecclesiastes,9,17,The words of wise [men are] heard in quiet more than the cry of him that rules among fools.
Ecclesiastes,9,18,Wisdom [is] better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroys much good.
