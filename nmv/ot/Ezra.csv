Ezra,1,1,"Now in the first year of Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] king of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] , that the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) by the mouth of Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] might be fulfilled, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) stirred up the spirit of Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] king of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] , that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and [put it] also in writing, saying,"
Ezra,1,2,"Thus says Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] king of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] , The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he has charged me to build him an house at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , which [is] in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
Ezra,1,3,"Who [is there] among you of all his people? his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] be with him, and let him go up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , which [is] in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and build the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , (he [is] the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ,) which [is] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Ezra,1,4,"And whosoever remains in any place where he sojournes, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] that [is] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Ezra,1,5,"Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , and the priests, and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , with all [them] whose spirit God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had raised, to go up to build the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) which [is] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Ezra,1,6,"And all they that [were] about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all [that] was willingly offered."
Ezra,1,7,"Also Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] had brought forth out of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and had put them in the house of his gods;"
Ezra,1,8,"Even those did Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] king of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] bring forth by the hand of Mitr’dat [given by Mithra (covenant)] the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbatzar [worshipper of fire] , the prince of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
Ezra,1,9,"And this [is] the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,"
Ezra,1,10,"Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second [sort] four hundred and ten, [and] other vessels a thousand."
Ezra,1,11,"All the vessels of gold and of silver [were] five thousand and four hundred. All [these] did Sheshbatzar [worshipper of fire] bring up with [them of] the captivity that were brought up from Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Ezra,2,1,"Now these [are] the children of the province that went up out of the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] had carried away unto Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and came again unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , every one unto his city;"

Ezra,2,69,"They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests’ garments."
Ezra,2,70,"So the priests, and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , and [some] of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the temple servants, dwelt in their cities, and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in their cities."
Ezra,3,1,"And when the seventh month was come, and the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [were] in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Ezra,3,2,"Then stood up Yeshua [he is saved] the son of Yotzadak [Yehovah is righteous] , and his brethren the priests, and Z’rubavel [sown in Babylon] the son of Sh’alti’el [I have asked of God] , and his brethren, and built the altar of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , to offer burnt offerings thereon, as [it is] written in the law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ezra,3,3,"And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear [was] upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [even] burnt offerings morning and evening."
Ezra,3,4,"They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as [it is] written, and [offered] the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;"
Ezra,3,5,"And afterward [offered] the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezra,3,6,From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . But the foundation of the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was not [yet] laid.
Ezra,3,7,"They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Tzidon [Hunting] , and to them of Tzor [a rock] , to bring cedar trees from L’vanon [Whiteness] to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] king of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid]."
Ezra,3,8,"Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , in the second month, began Z’rubavel [sown in Babylon] the son of Sh’alti’el [I have asked of God] , and Yeshua [he is saved] the son of Yotzadak [Yehovah is righteous] , and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; and appointed the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezra,3,9,"Then stood Yeshua [he is saved] [with] his sons and his brethren, Kadmi’el [God is the ancient one] and his sons, the sons of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : the sons of Henadad [favour of Hadad], [with] their sons and their brethren the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to]."
Ezra,3,10,"And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] the sons of Asaf [gatherer] with cymbals, to praise the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , after the ordinance of David [beloved] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezra,3,11,"And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; because [he is] good, for his mercy [endures] forever toward Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] . And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , because the foundation of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was laid."
Ezra,3,12,"But many of the priests and Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] and chief of the fathers, [who were] ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:"
Ezra,3,13,"So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off."
Ezra,4,1,Now when the adversaries of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] heard that the children of the captivity built the temple unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God];
Ezra,4,2,"Then they came to Z’rubavel [sown in Babylon] , and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , as you 2f [do] ; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-Hadon [Ashur has given a brother] king of Ashur [a step] , which brought us up here."
Ezra,4,3,"But Z’rubavel [sown in Babylon] , and Yeshua [he is saved] , and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , said unto them, You 2f have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , as king Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] the king of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] has commanded us."
Ezra,4,4,"Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and troubled them in building,"
Ezra,4,5,"And hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] king of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] , even until the reign of Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] king of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid]."
Ezra,4,6,"And in the reign of Achashverosh [I will be silent and poor] , in the beginning of his reign, wrote they [unto him] an accusation against the inhabitants of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Ezra,4,7,"And in the days of Artach’shashta [I will make the spoiled to boil: I will stir myself (in) winter] wrote Bishlam [in peace] , Mitr’dat [given by Mithra (covenant)] , Tav’el [God is good] , and the rest of their companions, unto Artach’shashta [I will make the spoiled to boil: I will stir myself (in) winter] king of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] ; and the writing of the letter [was] written in the Arami [exalted] tongue, and interpreted in the Arami [exalted] tongue."
Ezra,4,8,Rechum [compassion] the chancellor and Shimshai (sunny) the scribe wrote a letter against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to Artach’shashta [I will make the spoiled to boil: I will stir myself (in) winter] the king in this sort:
Ezra,4,9,"Then [wrote] Rechum [compassion] the chancellor, and Shimshai (sunny) the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dina’im [judgment] , the Afarsat’khim [meaning disputed] , the Tarp’lim [they are fallen] , the Afarsim [meaning disputed] , the Ark’vim [lengthy] , the Bavlim [confusion (my mixing)] , the Shushan’kayim [lily] , the Dehayim [the sickly], [and] the ‘Elma’im [their heaps],"
Ezra,4,10,"And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar [horned bull] brought over, and set in the cities of Shomron [watch mountain] , and the rest [that are] on this side the river, and at such a time."
Ezra,4,11,"This [is] the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, [even] unto Artach’shashta [I will make the spoiled to boil: I will stir myself (in) winter] the king; You 1s servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time."
Ezra,4,12,"Be it known unto the king, that the Y’hudim (Judeans) which came up from you i to us are come unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls [thereof] , and joined the foundations."
Ezra,4,13,"Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be built, and the walls set up [again, then] will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and [so] you i shall damage the revenue of the kings."
Ezra,4,14,"Now because we have maintenance from [the king’s] palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king’s dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;"
Ezra,4,15,"That search may be made in the book of the records of you i fathers: so shall you i find in the book of the records, and know that this city [is] a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed."
Ezra,4,16,"We certify the king that, if this city be built [again] , and the walls thereof set up, by this means you i shall have no portion on this side the river."
Ezra,4,17," [Then] sent the king an answer unto Rechum [compassion] the chancellor, and [to] Shimshai (sunny) the scribe, and [to] the rest of their companions that dwell in Shomron [watch mountain] , and [unto] the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time."
Ezra,4,18,The letter which you 2f sent unto us has been plainly read before me.
Ezra,4,19,"And I commanded, and search has been made, and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings, and [that] rebellion and sedition have been made in it."
Ezra,4,20,"There have been mighty kings also over Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , which have ruled over all [countries] beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them."
Ezra,4,21,"Give you 2f now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until [another] commandment shall be given from me."
Ezra,4,22,Take heed now that you 2f fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
Ezra,4,23,"Now when the copy of king Artach’shashta [I will make the spoiled to boil: I will stir myself (in) winter] ’ letter [was] read before Rechum [compassion] , and Shimshai (sunny) the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] unto the Y’hudim (Judeans) , and made them to cease by force and power."
Ezra,4,24,Then ceased the work of the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] which [is] at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] king of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid].
Ezra,5,1,"Then the prophets, Hagai [festive] the prophet, and Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers] the son of ‘Iddo [His witness] , prophesied unto the Y’hudim (Judeans) that [were] in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] in the name of the God-Elah [an oak] Yisra’el [The God of He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [even] unto them."
Ezra,5,2,"Then rose up Z’rubavel [sown in Babylon] the son of Sh’alti’el [I have asked of God] , and Yeshua [he is saved] the son of Yotzadak [Yehovah is righteous] , and began to build the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] which [is] at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : and with them [were] the prophets of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] helping them."
Ezra,5,3,"At the same time came to them Tatnai [gift] , governor on this side the river, and Sh’tar-Boznai [star of splendour] , and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who has commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?"
Ezra,5,4,"Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?"
Ezra,5,5,"But the eye of their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was upon the elders of the Y’hudim (Judeans) , that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] : and then they returned answer by letter concerning this [matter]."
Ezra,5,6,"The copy of the letter that Tatnai [gift] , governor on this side the river, and Sh’tar-Boznai [star of splendour] , and his companions the Afar’s’khi [as causers of division] , which [were] on this side the river, sent unto Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] the king:"
Ezra,5,7,"They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] the king, all peace."
Ezra,5,8,"Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goes fast on, and prospers in their hands."
Ezra,5,9,"Then asked we those elders, [and] said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?"
Ezra,5,10,"We asked their names also, to certify you i , that we might write the names of the men that [were] the chief of them."
Ezra,5,11,"And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of heaven and earth, and build the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] built and set up."
Ezra,5,12,"But after that our fathers had provoked the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Ezra,5,13,"But in the first year of Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] [the same] king Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] made a decree to build this house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ezra,5,14,"And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] took out of the temple that [was] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and brought them into the temple of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , those did Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] the king take out of the temple of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and they were delivered unto [one] , whose name [was] Sheshbatzar [worshipper of fire] , whom he had made governor;"
Ezra,5,15,"And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that [is] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and let the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] be built in his place."
Ezra,5,16,"Then came the same Sheshbatzar [worshipper of fire], [and] laid the foundation of the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] which [is] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : and since that time even until now has it been in building, and [yet] it is not finished."
Ezra,5,17,"Now therefore, if [it seem] good to the king, let there be search made in the king’s treasure house, which [is] there at Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , whether it be [so] , that a decree was made of Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] the king to build this house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter."
Ezra,6,1,"Then Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Ezra,6,2,"And there was found at Achm’ta (Ecbatana) [meaning unknown] , in the palace that [is] in the province of the Medes [middle land] , a roll, and in it [was] a record thus written:"
Ezra,6,3,"In the first year of Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] the king [the same] Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] the king made a decree [concerning] the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, [and] the breadth thereof threescore cubits;"
Ezra,6,4," [With] three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king’s house:"
Ezra,6,5,"And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] took forth out of the temple which [is] at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and brought unto Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , be restored, and brought again unto the temple which [is] at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace], [every one] to his place, and place [them] in the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ezra,6,6,"Now [therefore] , Tatnai [gift] , governor beyond the river, Sh’tar-Boznai [star of splendour] , and your companions the Afar’s’khi [as causers of division] , which [are] beyond the river, be you 2f far from there:"
Ezra,6,7,Let the work of this house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] alone; let the governor of the Y’hudim (Judeans) and the elders of the Y’hudim (Judeans) build this house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in his place.
Ezra,6,8,"Moreover I make a decree what you 2f shall do to the elders of these Y’hudim (Judeans) for the building of this house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : that of the king’s goods, [even] of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered."
Ezra,6,9,"And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which [are] at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , let it be given them day by day without fail:"
Ezra,6,10,"That they may offer sacrifices of soothing aromas unto the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons."
Ezra,6,11,"Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this."
Ezra,6,12,"And the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] that has caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter [and] to destroy this house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] which [is] at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . I Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] have made a decree; let it be done with speed."
Ezra,6,13,"Then Tatnai [gift] , governor on this side the river, Sh’tar-Boznai [star of splendour] , and their companions, according to that which Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] the king had sent, so they did speedily."
Ezra,6,14,"And the elders of the Y’hudim (Judeans) built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Hagai [festive] the prophet and Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers] the son of ‘Iddo [His witness] . And they built, and finished [it] , according to the commandment of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and according to the commandment of Koresh (Cyrus) [possess you the furnace] , and Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] , and Artach’shashta [I will make the spoiled to boil: I will stir myself (in) winter] king of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid]."
Ezra,6,15,"And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] the king."
Ezra,6,16,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , the priests, and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] with joy,"
Ezra,6,17,"And offered at the dedication of this house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezra,6,18,"And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] in their courses, for the service of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which [is] at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; as it is written in the book of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Ezra,6,19,And the children of the captivity kept the Passover upon the fourteenth [day] of the first month.
Ezra,6,20,"For the priests and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] were purified together, all of them [were] pure, and killed the Passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves."
Ezra,6,21,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , did eat,"
Ezra,6,22,"And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezra,7,1,"Now after these things, in the reign of Artach’shashta [I will make the spoiled to boil: I will stir myself (in) winter] king of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] , ‘the son of S’rayah [Yehovah is ruler] , the son of ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] , the son of Hilkiyahu [my portion is Yehovah],"
Ezra,7,2,"The son of Shalum [retribution] , the son of Tzadok [righteous] , the son of Achituv [my brother is good],"
Ezra,7,3,"The son of Amaryah [Yehovah speaks] , the son of ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] , the son of M’rayot [rebellious],"
Ezra,7,4,"The son of Z’rachyah [Yehovah has risen] , the son of ‘Uzi [strong] , the son of Buki [Wasting],"
Ezra,7,5,"The son of Avishua [my father is safety] , the son of Pinchas [mouth of brass] , the son of El’azar [God has helped] , the son of Aharon [Bright, Very High] the chief priest:"
Ezra,7,6,"This ‘went up from Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] ; and he [was] a ready scribe in the law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] upon him."
Ezra,7,7,"And there went up [some] of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and of the priests, and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , and the singers, and the porters, and the temple servants, unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , in the seventh year of Artach’shashta [I will make the spoiled to boil: I will stir myself (in) winter] the king."
Ezra,7,8,"And he came to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] in the fifth month, which [was] in the seventh year of the king."
Ezra,7,9,"For upon the first [day] of the first month began he to go up from Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and on the first [day] of the fifth month came he to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , according to the good hand of his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] upon him."
Ezra,7,10,"For ‘had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and to do [it] , and to teach in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] statutes and judgments."
Ezra,7,11,"Now this [is] the copy of the letter that the king Artach’shashta [I will make the spoiled to boil: I will stir myself (in) winter] gave unto ‘the priest, the scribe, [even] a scribe of the words of the commandments of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and of his statutes to Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezra,7,12,"Artach’shashta [I will make the spoiled to boil: I will stir myself (in) winter] , king of kings, unto ‘the priest, a scribe of the law of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of heaven, perfect [peace] , and at such a time."
Ezra,7,13,"I make a decree, that all they of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and [of] his priests and Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , go with you i."
Ezra,7,14,"Forasmuch as you i are sent of the king, and of his seven counselors, to enquire concerning Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , according to the law of you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] which [is] in you i hand;"
Ezra,7,15,"And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered unto the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , whose habitation [is] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace],"
Ezra,7,16,"And all the silver and gold that you i can find in all the province of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] which [is] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]:"
Ezra,7,17,"That you i may buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] which [is] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Ezra,7,18,"And whatsoever shall seem good to you i , and to you i brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ezra,7,19,"The vessels also that are given you i for the service of the house of your i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered], [those] deliver you i before Elah [an oak] Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] [God of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]]."
Ezra,7,20,"And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which you i shall have occasion to bestow, bestow [it] out of the king’s treasure house."
Ezra,7,21,"And I, [even] I Artach’shashta [I will make the spoiled to boil: I will stir myself (in) winter] the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which [are] beyond the river, that whatsoever ‘the priest, the scribe of the law of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily,"
Ezra,7,22,"Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing [how much]."
Ezra,7,23,"Whatsoever is commanded by the God-Elah [an oak] of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God-Elah [an oak] [The Living Word] (The Many Powered) of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?"
Ezra,7,24,"Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , singers, porters, temple servants, or ministers of this house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them."
Ezra,7,25,"And you i , ‘Ezra, after the wisdom of you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , that [is] in you i hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that [are] beyond the river, all such as know the laws of you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; and teach you 2f them that know [them] not."
Ezra,7,26,"And whosoever will not do the law of you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether [it be] unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment."
Ezra,7,27,"Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of our fathers, which has put [such a thing] as this in the king’s heart, to beautify the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) which [is] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]:"
Ezra,7,28,"And has extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counselors, and before all the king’s mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [was] upon me, and I gathered together out of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] chief men to go up with me."
Ezra,8,1,"These [are] now the chief of their fathers, and [this is] the genealogy of them that went up with me from Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , in the reign of Artach’shashta [I will make the spoiled to boil: I will stir myself (in) winter] the king."
Ezra,8,2,Of the sons of Pinchas [mouth of brass] ; Gershom [Exiled One] : of the sons of Itamar [Coast of Palms] ; Dani’el [God is Judge] : of the sons of David [beloved] ; Hatush [assembled].
Ezra,8,3,"Of the sons of Sh’khanyah [dweller with Yehovah] , of the sons of Par’osh [flea] ; Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers] : and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty."
Ezra,8,4,"Of the sons of Pachat-Mo’av [pit of Mo’av] ; Ely’ho’einai [unto Yehovah are my eyes] the son of Z’rachyah [Yehovah has risen] , and with him two hundred males."
Ezra,8,5,"Of the sons of Sh’khanyah [dweller with Yehovah] ; the son of Yachazi’el [beheld of God] , and with him three hundred males."
Ezra,8,6,"Of the sons also of ‘Adin [delicate] ; Eved [A Slave] the son of Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] , and with him fifty males."
Ezra,8,7,"And of the sons of ‘Eilam [eternity] ; Yesha’yah [Yehovah has saved] the son of ‘Atalyahu [afflicted of the Lord] , and with him seventy males."
Ezra,8,8,"And of the sons of Sh’fatyah [Yehovah has judged] ; Z’vadyah [endowment of Yehovah] the son of Mikha’el [Who is Like God?] , and with him eighty males."
Ezra,8,9,"Of the sons of Yo’av [Yehovah is father] ; ‘Ovadyah [servant of Yehovah] the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males."
Ezra,8,10,"And of the sons of Shlomit [Peaceful] ; the son of Yosifyah [Yehovah adds] , and with him an hundred and threescore males."
Ezra,8,11,"And of the sons of Bevai [my cavities] ; Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers] the son of Bevai [my cavities] , and with him twenty and eight males."
Ezra,8,12,"And of the sons of ‘Azgad [Gad is mighty] ; Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the son of HaKatan [the small] , and with him an hundred and ten males."
Ezra,8,13,"And of the last sons of Adonikam [my lord arose] , whose names [are] these, Elifelet [God is deliverance] , Ye’i’el [God sweeps away] , and Sh’may’yah [Yehovah hears] , and with them threescore males."
Ezra,8,14,"Of the sons also of Bigvai [in my bodies] ; ‘Utai [helpful] , and Zavud [given] , and with them seventy males."
Ezra,8,15,"And I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava [I shall subsist] ; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner]."
Ezra,8,16,"Then sent I for Eli’ezer [God is help] , for Ari’el [lion of God] , for Sh’may’yah [Yehovah hears] , and for Elnatan [God has given] , and for Yariv [he contends] , and for Elnatan [God has given] , and for Natan [giver] , and for Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers] , and for Meshulam [friend] , chief men; also for Yoyariv [Yehovah contends] , and for Elnatan [God has given] , men of understanding."
Ezra,8,17,"And I sent them with commandment unto ‘Iddo [His witness] the chief at the place Kasifya [silvery] , and I told them what they should say unto ‘Iddo [His witness], [and] to his brethren the temple servants, at the place Kasifya [silvery] , that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ezra,8,18,"And by the good hand of our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Machli [Sick] , the son of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] , the son of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and Sherevyah [Yehovah has scorched] , with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;"
Ezra,8,19,"And Hashavyah [Yehovah has considered] , and with him Yesha’yah [Yehovah has saved] of the sons of M’rari [Bitter] , his brethren and their sons, twenty;"
Ezra,8,20,"Also of the temple servants, whom David [beloved] and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , two hundred and twenty temple servants: all of them were expressed by name."
Ezra,8,21,"Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava [I shall subsist] , that we might afflict ourselves before our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance."
Ezra,8,22,"For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is] upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath [is] against all them that forsake him."
Ezra,8,23,So we fasted and besought our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] for this: and he was intreated of us.
Ezra,8,24,"Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherevyah [Yehovah has scorched] , Hashavyah [Yehovah has considered] , and ten of their brethren with them,"
Ezra,8,25,"And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, [even] the offering of the house of our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which the king, and his counselors, and his lords, and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [there] present, had offered:"
Ezra,8,26,"I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, [and] of gold an hundred talents;"
Ezra,8,27,"Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold."
Ezra,8,28,"And I said unto them, You 2f [are] holy unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; the vessels [are] holy also; and the silver and the gold [are] a freewill offering unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of your fathers."
Ezra,8,29,"Watch you 2f , and keep [them] , until you 2f weigh [them] before the chief of the priests and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , and chief of the fathers of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , in the chambers of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezra,8,30,"So took the priests and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring [them] to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] unto the house of our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ezra,8,31,"Then we departed from the river of Ahava [I shall subsist] on the twelfth [day] of the first month, to go unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : and the hand of our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way."
Ezra,8,32,"And we came to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and abode there three days."
Ezra,8,33,"Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] by the hand of M’remot [elevations] the son of Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] the priest; and with him [was] El’azar [God has helped] the son of Pinchas [mouth of brass] ; and with them [was] Yozavad [Yehovah has endowed] the son of Yeshua [he is saved] , and No’adyah [meeting with Yehovah] the son of Binui [built up] , Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to];"
Ezra,8,34,By number [and] by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.
Ezra,8,35," [Also] the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , twelve bullocks for all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats [for] a sin offering: all [this was] a burnt offering unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezra,8,36,"And they delivered the king’s commissions unto the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ezra,9,1,"Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and the priests, and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, [doing] according to their abominations, [even] of the Kena’ani [Merchant] , the Hitti [Terrorists] , the P’rizi [Dwellers in Unwalled Towns] , the Y’vusi [Threshers, Trampled Under Foot] , the ‘Amon [Inbred] , the Mo’avi [of his father] , the Mitzri, and the Emori [Highlanders]."
Ezra,9,2,"For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of [those] lands: yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass."
Ezra,9,3,"And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my Mantle (cloak; covering garment) (cloak) , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonished."
Ezra,9,4,"Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonished until the evening sacrifice."
Ezra,9,5,"And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my Mantle (cloak; covering garment) (cloak) , I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered],"
Ezra,9,6,"And said, O my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you i , my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : for our iniquities are increased over [our] head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens."
Ezra,9,7,"Since the days of our fathers [have] we [been] in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, [and] our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil (plunder; prey; booty) , and to confusion of face, as [it is] this day."
Ezra,9,8,"And now for a little space grace has been [showed] from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage."
Ezra,9,9,"For we [were] bondmen; yet our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] , to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Ezra,9,10,"And now, O our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken you i commandments,"
Ezra,9,11,"Which you i have commanded by you i servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which you 2f go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness."
Ezra,9,12,"Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth forever: that you 2f may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave [it] for an inheritance to your children forever."
Ezra,9,13,"And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that you i our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] have punished us less than our iniquities [deserve] , and have given us [such] deliverance as this;"
Ezra,9,14,"Should we again break you i commandments, and join in affinity (to become an in-law) with the people of these abominations? would not you i be angry with us till you i had consumed [us] , so that [there should be] no remnant nor escaping?"
Ezra,9,15,"O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , you i [are] righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as [it is] this day: behold, we [are] before you i in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before you i because of this."
Ezra,10,1,"Now when ‘had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , there assembled unto him out of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore."
Ezra,10,2,"And Sh’khanyah [dweller with Yehovah] the son of Jehiel, [one] of the sons of ‘Eilam [eternity] , answered and said unto ‘Ezra, We have trespassed against our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] concerning this thing."
Ezra,10,3,"Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; and let it be done according to the law."
Ezra,10,4,"Arise; for [this] matter [belongs] unto you i : we also [will be] with you i : be of good courage, and do [it]."
Ezra,10,5,"Then arose ‘Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , to swear that they should do according to this word. And they swore."
Ezra,10,6,"Then ‘rose up from before the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and went into the chamber of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the son of Elyashiv [God restores] : and [when] he came there, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away."
Ezra,10,7,"And they made proclamation throughout Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace];"
Ezra,10,8,"And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away."
Ezra,10,9,"Then all the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] gathered themselves together unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] within three days. It [was] the ninth month, on the twentieth [day] of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , trembling because of [this] matter, and for the great rain."
Ezra,10,10,"And ‘the priest stood up, and said unto them, You 2f have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezra,10,11,"Now therefore make confession unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives."
Ezra,10,12,"Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As you i have said, so must we do."
Ezra,10,13,"But the people [are] many, and [it is] a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither [is this] a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing."
Ezra,10,14,"Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] for this matter be turned from us."
Ezra,10,15,Only Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] the son of ‘Asah’el [God-made] and Yachz’yah [Yehovah views] the son of Tikvah [hope] were employed about this [matter] : and Meshulam [friend] and Shabtai [sabbatical] the Levi (Levite) [Joined to] helped them.
Ezra,10,16,"And the children of the captivity did so. And ‘the priest, [with] certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by [their] names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter."
Ezra,10,17,And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.
Ezra,10,18,"And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: [namely] , of the sons of Yeshua [he is saved] the son of Yotzadak [Yehovah is righteous] , and his brethren; Ma’aseiyah [work of Yehovah] , and Eli’ezer [God is help] , and Yariv [he contends] , and G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great]."
