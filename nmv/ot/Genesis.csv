Genesis,16,11,"And the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto her, Behold, you i [are] with child, and shall bear a son, and shall call his name Yishma’el (He Will Hear God; God hears [EL]) ; because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has heard your i affliction."
Genesis,16,12,"And he will be a wild man; his hand [will be] against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren."
Genesis,16,13,"And she called the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) that spoke unto her, You i God-EL Ro’I [The Powerful Living Word Sees Me] : for she said, Have I also here looked after him that sees me?"
Genesis,16,14,"For what reason the well was called Be’er-Lachai-Ro’i (well of the living One seeing me) ; behold, [it is] between Kadesh (to be consecrated, consecrated, sanctified) and Bered (hail, grizzled)."
Genesis,16,15,"And Hagar (Flight) bore Avram (Exalted Father; Father Of Elevation) a son: and Avram (Exalted Father; Father Of Elevation) called his son’s name, which Hagar (Flight) bore, Yishma’el (He Will Hear God; God hears [EL])."
Genesis,16,16,"And Avram (Exalted Father; Father Of Elevation) [was] eighty and six years old, when Hagar (Flight) bore Yishma’el (He Will Hear God; God hears [EL]) to Avram (Exalted Father; Father Of Elevation)."
Genesis,17,1,"And when Avram (Exalted Father; Father Of Elevation) was ninety years old and nine, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) appeared to Avram (Exalted Father; Father Of Elevation) , and said unto him, I [am] the Almighty God-El Shaddai [The Powerful Living Word] : walk before me, and be you i perfect."
Genesis,17,2,"And I will make my covenant between me and you i , and will multiply you i exceedingly."
Genesis,17,3,"And Avram (Exalted Father; Father Of Elevation) fell on his face: and God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] talked with him, saying,"
Genesis,17,4,"As for me, behold, my covenant [is] with you i , and you i shall be a father of many nations."
Genesis,17,5,"Neither shall your i name any more be called Avram (Exalted Father; Father Of Elevation) , but your i name shall be Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] [father of many/They Will Fly] ; for a father of many nations have I made you i."
Genesis,17,6,"And I will make you i exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of you i , and kings shall come out of you i."
Genesis,17,7,"And I will establish my covenant between me and you i and your i seed after you i in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] unto you i , and to your i seed after you i."
Genesis,17,8,"And I will give unto you i , and to your i seed after you i , the land wherein you i are a stranger, all the land of Kena’an (merchant; trader; or that humbles and subdues) , for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered]."
Genesis,17,9,"And God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] said unto Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] , You i shall keep my covenant therefore, you i , and your i seed after you i in their generations."
Genesis,17,10,"This [is] my covenant, which you f shall keep, between me and you i and your i seed after you i ; Every man child among you i shall be circumcised."
Genesis,17,11,And you f shall circumcise the flesh of yourf foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant between me and you.
Genesis,17,12,"And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in yourf generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which [is] not of your i seed."
Genesis,17,13,"He that is born in your i house, and he that is bought with your i money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in yourf flesh for an everlasting covenant."
Genesis,17,14,"And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant."
Genesis,17,15,"And God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] said unto Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] , As for Sarai (My Princess) your i wife, you i shall not call her name Sarai (My Princess) , but Sarah [Princess] [shall] her name [be]."
Genesis,17,16,"And I will bless her, and give you i a son also of her: yes, I will bless her, and she shall be [a mother] of nations; kings of people shall be of her."
Genesis,17,17,"Then Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall [a child] be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah [Princess] , that is ninety years old, bear?"
Genesis,17,18,"And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] said unto God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] , O that Yishma’el (He Will Hear God; God hears [EL]) might live before you i!"
Genesis,17,19,"And God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] said, Sarah [Princess] your i wife shall bear you i a son indeed; and you i shall call his name Yitz’chak [Laughter] : and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, [and] with his seed after him."
Genesis,17,20,"And as for Yishma’el (He Will Hear God; God hears [EL] ), I have heard you i : Behold, I have Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget (to be father of; be ancestor of) , and I will make him a great nation."
Genesis,17,21,"But my covenant will I establish with Yitz’chak [Laughter] , which Sarah [Princess] shall bear unto you i at this set time in the next year."
Genesis,17,22,"And he left off talking with him, and God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] went up from Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will]."
Genesis,17,23,"And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] took Yishma’el (He Will Hear God; God hears [EL] ) his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Avraham’s [exalted father/Fly They Will] house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] had said unto him."
Genesis,17,24,"And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] [was] ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
Genesis,17,25,"And Yishma’el (He Will Hear God; God hears [EL]) his son [was] thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
Genesis,17,26,"In the selfsame day was Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] circumcised, and Yishma’el (He Will Hear God; God hears [EL]) his son."
Genesis,17,27,"And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him."
Genesis,18,1,And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre (firmness; fatling (fat cattle) offering) : and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
Genesis,18,2,"And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw [them] , he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,"
Genesis,18,3,"And said, My Lord-Adonai [The Father] (Greatest Above All) , if now I have found favour in your i sight, pass not away, I pray you i , from your i servant:"
Genesis,18,4,"Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash yourf feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:"
Genesis,18,5,"And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort you 1sf yourf hearts; after that you 1sf shall pass on: for therefore are you 1sf come to yourf servant. And they said, So do, as you i have said."
Genesis,18,6,"And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] hastened into the tent unto Sarah [Princess] , and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth."
Genesis,18,7,"And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave [it] unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it."
Genesis,18,8,"And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set [it] before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat."
Genesis,18,9,"And they said unto him, Where [is] Sarah [Princess] your i wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent."
Genesis,18,10,"And he said, I will certainly return unto you i according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah [Princess] your i wife shall have a son. And Sarah [Princess] heard [it] in the tent door, which [was] behind him."
Genesis,18,11,Now Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] and Sarah [Princess] [were] old [and] well stricken in age; [and] it ceased to be with Sarah [Princess] after the manner of women.
Genesis,18,12,"Therefore Sarah [Princess] laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
Genesis,18,13,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] , For what reason did Sarah [Princess] laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?"
Genesis,18,14,"Is anything too hard for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ? At the time appointed I will return unto you i , according to the time of life, and Sarah [Princess] shall have a son."
Genesis,18,15,"Then Sarah [Princess] denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, No; but you i did laugh."
Genesis,18,16,"And the men rose up from there, and looked toward S’dom (burning, denotes penal constrictions around the ankles) : and Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] went with them to bring them on the way."
Genesis,18,17,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, Shall I hide from Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] that thing which I do;"
Genesis,18,18,"Seeing that Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) in him?"
Genesis,18,19,"For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to do justice and judgment; that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) may bring upon Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] that which he has spoken of him."
Genesis,18,20,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, Because the cry of S’dom (burning, denotes penal constrictions around the ankles) and ‘Amora (submersion, Tyrants, bind sheaves, People of Fear) is great, and because their sin is very grievous;"
Genesis,18,21,"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know."
Genesis,18,22,"And the men turned their faces from there, and went toward S’dom (burning, denotes penal constrictions around the ankles) : but Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] stood yet before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Genesis,18,23,"And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] drew near, and said, Will you i also destroy the righteous with the wicked?"
Genesis,18,24,Perhaps there be fifty righteous within the city: will you i also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that [are] in it?
Genesis,18,25,"That be far from you i to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from you i : Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
Genesis,18,26,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, If I find in S’dom (burning, denotes penal constrictions around the ankles) fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes."
Genesis,18,27,"And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord-Adonai (Greatest Above All) GOD-Yehōvih [THE FATHER] , which [am but] dust and ashes:"
Genesis,18,28,"Perhaps there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: will you i destroy all the city for [lack of] five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy [it]."
Genesis,18,29,"And he spoke unto him yet again, and said, Perhaps there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do [it] for forty’s sake."
Genesis,18,30,"And he said [unto him] , Oh let not the Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All] be angry, and I will speak: Perhaps there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do [it] , if I find thirty there."
Genesis,18,31,"And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord-Adonai (Greatest Above All) GOD-Yehōvih [THE FATHER] : Perhaps there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for twenty’s sake."
Genesis,18,32,"And he said, Oh let not the Lord-Adonai (Greatest Above All) GOD-Yehōvih [THE FATHER] be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Perhaps ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for ten’s sake."
Genesis,18,33,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will]: and Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] returned unto his place."
Genesis,19,1,"And there came two angels to S’dom (burning, denotes penal constrictions around the ankles) at even; and Lot (Covering) sat in the gate of S’dom: and Lot seeing [them] rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;"
Genesis,19,2,"And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into yourf servant’s house, and wait all night, and wash yourf feet, and you f shall rise up early, and go on yourf ways. And they said, No; but we will abide in the street all night."
Genesis,19,3,"And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat."
Genesis,19,4,"But before they lay down, the men of the city, [even] the men of S’dom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:"
Genesis,19,5,"And they called unto Lot (Covering) , and said unto him, Where [are] the men which came in to you i this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them."
Genesis,19,6,"And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,"
Genesis,19,7,"And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly."
Genesis,19,8,"Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do you f to them as [is] good in yourf eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof."
Genesis,19,9,"And they said, Stand back. And they said [again] , This one [fellow] came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with you i , than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, [even] Lot, and came near to break the door."
Genesis,19,10,"But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door."
Genesis,19,11,"And they struck the men that [were] at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door."
Genesis,19,12,"And the men said unto Lot, Have you i here any besides? son in law, and your i sons, and your i daughters, and whatsoever you i have in the city, bring [them] out of this place:"
Genesis,19,13,"For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has sent us to destroy it."
Genesis,19,14,"And Lot went out, and spoke unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you i out of this place; for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law."
Genesis,19,15,"And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take your i wife, and your i two daughters, which are here; lest you i be consumed in the iniquity of the city."
Genesis,19,16,"And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city."
Genesis,19,17,"And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for your i life; look not behind you i , neither stay you i in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest you i be consumed."
Genesis,19,18,"And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord (Ruler of the Earth):"
Genesis,19,19,"Behold now, your i servant has found grace in your i sight, and you i have magnified your i mercy, which you i have showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:"
Genesis,19,20,"Behold now, this city [is] near to flee unto, and it [is] a little one: Oh, let me escape there, ([is] it not a little one?) and my soul shall live."
Genesis,19,21,"And he said unto him, See, I have accepted you i concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which you i have spoken."
Genesis,19,22,"Haste you i , escape there; for I cannot do anything till you i come there. Therefore the name of the city was called Tzo’ar (little place)."
Genesis,19,23,The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot (Covering) entered into Tzo’ar (little place).
Genesis,19,24,"Then the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) rained upon S’dom (burning, denotes penal constrictions around the ankles) and upon ‘Amora (submersion, Tyrants, bind sheaves, People of Fear) sulfur and fire from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) out of heaven;"
Genesis,19,25,"And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground."
Genesis,19,26,"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."
Genesis,19,27,And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):
Genesis,19,28,"And he looked toward S’dom (burning, denotes penal constrictions around the ankles) and ‘Amora (submersion, Tyrants, bind sheaves, People of Fear) , and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace."
Genesis,19,29,"And it came to pass, when God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] destroyed the cities of the plain, that God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] remembered Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] , and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt."
Genesis,19,30,"And Lot went up out of Tzo’ar (little place) , and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Tzo’ar (little place) : and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters."
Genesis,19,31,"And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father [is] old, and [there is] not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:"
Genesis,19,32,"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
Genesis,19,33,"And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
Genesis,19,34,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yester night with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go you i in, [and] lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
Genesis,19,35,"And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
Genesis,19,36,In the following manner were both the daughters of Lot (Covering) with child by their father.
Genesis,19,37,"And the firstborn bore a son, and called his name Mo’av (of his father; Who’s Your Daddy!?) : the same is the father of the Mo’av (of his father; Who’s Your Daddy!?) unto this day."
Genesis,19,38,"And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-’’Ammi [my people] (son of my grandfather) : the same is the father of the children of ‘‘Amon [master workman] (bastard; hidden one) unto this day."
Genesis,20,1,"And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] journeyed from there toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh (to be consecrated, consecrated, sanctified) and Shur [wall] (wall) , and detained (held) in G’rar (a lodging place)."
Genesis,20,2,"And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] said of Sarah [Princess] his wife, She [is] my sister: and Avi-melekh (my father is king) king of G’rar (a lodging place) sent, and took Sarah [Princess]."
Genesis,20,3,"But God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] came to Avi-melekh (my father is king) in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, you i [are but] a dead man, for the woman which you i hast taken; for she [is] a man’s wife."
Genesis,20,4,"But Avi-melekh (my father is king) had not come near her: and he said, Lord-Adonai [The Father] (Greatest Above All) , will you i slay also a righteous nation?"
Genesis,20,5,"Said he not unto me, She [is] my sister? and she, even she herself said, He [is] my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this."
Genesis,20,6,"And God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] said unto him in a dream, Yes, I know that you i did this in the integrity of your i heart; for I also withheld you i from sinning against me: therefore suffered I you i not to touch her."
Genesis,20,7,"Now therefore restore the man [his] wife; for he [is] a prophet, and he shall pray for you i , and you i shall live: and if you i restore [her] not, know you i that you i shall surely die, you i , and all that [are] yoursi."
Genesis,20,8,"Therefore Avi-melekh (my father is king) rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid."
Genesis,20,9,"Then Avi-melekh called Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] , and said unto him, What hast you i done unto us? and what have I offended you i , that you i hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? you i hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done."
Genesis,20,10,"And Avi-melekh said unto Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] , What [did] you i see, that you i have done this thing?"
Genesis,20,11,"And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] [is] not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake."
Genesis,20,12,"And yet indeed [she is] my sister; she [is] the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife."
Genesis,20,13,"And it came to pass, when God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This [is] you (i) kindness which you i shall show unto me; at every place to where we shall come, say of me, He [is] my brother."
Genesis,20,14,"And Avi-melekh (my father is king) took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and women servants, and gave [them] unto Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] , and restored him Sarah [Princess] his wife."
Genesis,20,15,"And Avi-melekh (my father is king) said, Behold, my land [is] before you i : dwell where it pleases you i."
Genesis,20,16,"And unto Sarah [Princess] he said, Behold, I have given your i brother a thousand [pieces] of silver: behold, he [is] to you i a covering of the eyes, unto all that [are] with you i , and with all [other] : in this way she was reproved."
Genesis,20,17,"So Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] prayed unto God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] : and God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] healed Avi-melekh (my father is king) , and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore children."
Genesis,20,18,"For the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Avi-melekh, because of Sarah [Princess] Avraham’s [exalted father/Fly They Will] wife."
Genesis,21,1,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) visited Sarah [Princess] as he had said, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) did unto Sarah [Princess] as he had spoken."
Genesis,21,2,"For Sarah [Princess] conceived, and bore Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] a son in his old age, at the set time of which God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] had spoken to him."
Genesis,21,3,"And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah [Princess] bore to him, Yitz’chak [Laughter]."
Genesis,21,4,"And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] circumcised his son Yitz’chak [Laughter] being eight days old, as God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] had commanded him."
Genesis,21,5,"And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] was an hundred years old, when his son Yitz’chak [Laughter] was born unto him."
Genesis,21,6,"And Sarah [Princess] said, God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] has made me to laugh, [so that] all that hear will laugh with me."
Genesis,21,7,"And she said, Who would have said unto Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] , that Sarah [Princess] should have given children suck? for I have born [him] a son in his old age."
Genesis,21,8,"And the child grew, and was weaned: and Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] made a great feast the [same] day that Yitz’chak [Laughter] was weaned."
Genesis,21,9,"And Sarah [Princess] saw the son of Hagar (Flight) the Mitzrayimot (People of the Black Land) , which she had born unto Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] , mocking."
Genesis,21,10,"For what reason she said unto Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] , Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, [even] with Yitz’chak [Laughter]."
Genesis,21,11,And the thing was very grievous in Avraham’s [exalted father/Fly They Will] sight because of his son.
Genesis,21,12,"And God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] said unto Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] , Let it not be grievous in your i sight because of the boy, and because of your i bondwoman; in all that Sarah [Princess] has said unto you i , hearken unto her voice; for in Yitz’chak [Laughter] shall your i seed be called."
Genesis,21,13,"And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he [is] your i seed."
Genesis,21,14,"And Avraham [exalted father/Fly They Will] rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave [it] unto Hagar, putting [it] on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Be’er-Sheva (well of the sevenfold oath)."
Genesis,21,15,"And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs."

Genesis,27,20,"And Yitz’chak [Laughter] said unto his son, How [is it] that you i hast found [it] so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your i God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] brought [it] to me."
Genesis,27,21,"And Yitz’chak [Laughter] said unto Ya’akov (he who holds onto the heel of) , Come near, I pray you i , that I may feel you i , my son, whether you i [be] my very son ‘Esav or not."
Genesis,27,22,"And Ya’akov went near unto Yitz’chak [Laughter] his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice [is] Ya’akov’s voice, but the hands [are] the hands of ‘Esav (hairy)."

Genesis,27,27,"And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his clothing, and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) him, and said, See, the smell of my son [is] as the smell of a field which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous):"

Genesis,27,35,"And he said, your i brother came with subtlety, and has taken away your i blessing."
Genesis,27,36,"And he said, Is not he rightly named Ya’akov (he who holds onto the heel of)?!? for he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you i not reserved a blessing for me?"
Genesis,27,37,"And Yitz’chak [Laughter] answered and said unto ‘Esav (hairy) , Behold, I have made him your i lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto you i , my son?"

Genesis,32,19,"And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall you 1sf speak unto ‘Esav (hairy) , when you 1sf find him."
Genesis,32,20,"And say you f moreover, Behold, your i servant Ya’akov [is] behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept of me."
Genesis,32,21,So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
Genesis,32,22,"And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two women servants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Yabok (emptying; to flow)."
Genesis,32,23,"And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had."
Genesis,32,24,And Ya’akov (he who holds onto the heel of) was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
Genesis,32,25,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Ya’akov’s (he who holds onto the heel of) thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him."
Genesis,32,26,"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let you i go, except you i bless me."
Genesis,32,27,"And he said unto him, What [is] your i name? And he said, Ya’akov (he who holds onto the heel of)."
Genesis,32,28,"And he said, your i name shall be called no more Ya’akov (he who holds onto the heel of) , but Isra’el [he who holds onto God-The Creator] : for as a prince have you i power with God [EL- The Powerful Living Word] and with men, and hast prevailed."
Genesis,32,29,"And Ya’akov asked [him] , and said, Tell [me] , I pray you i , your i name. And he said, For what reason [is] it [that] you i ask after my name? And he Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) him there."
Genesis,32,30,"And Ya’akov (he who holds onto the heel of) called the name of the place P’ni-El [Face of The Powerful Living Word of GOD] : for I have seen God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] face to face, and my life is preserved."
Genesis,32,31,"And Ya’akov (he who holds onto the heel of) as he passed over P’ni-El [Face of The Powerful Living Word of GOD] the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh."
Genesis,32,32,"Therefore the children of Isra’el eat not [of] the sinew which shrank, which [is] upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Ya’akov’s thigh in the sinew that shrank."
Genesis,33,1,"And Ya’akov lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, ‘Esav (hairy) came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Le’ah (weary; grieved) , and unto Rachel (ewe) , and unto the two handmaids."

Genesis,33,4,"And ‘Esav (hairy) ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept."
Genesis,33,5,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who [are] those with you i ? And he said, The children which God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] has graciously given your i servant."
Genesis,33,6,"Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves."
Genesis,33,7,"And Le’ah (weary; grieved) also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves."
Genesis,33,8,"And he said, What [mean] you i by all this drove which I met? And he said, [These are] to find grace in the sight of my lord."
Genesis,33,9,"And ‘Esav (hairy) said, I have enough, my brother; keep that you i hast unto thyself."
Genesis,33,10,"And Ya’akov (he who holds onto the heel of) said, No, I pray you i , if now I have found grace in your i sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen your i face, as though I had seen the face of God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] , and you i were pleased with me."
Genesis,33,11,"Take, I pray you i , my blessing that is brought to you i ; because God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took [it]."
Genesis,33,12,"And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you i."
Genesis,33,13,"And he said unto him, My lord knows that the children [are] tender, and the flocks and herds with young [are] with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die."
Genesis,33,14,"Let my lord, I pray you i , pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goes before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Se’ir (hairy, shaggy; The Hairy Guys; riding the storm)."
Genesis,33,15,"And ‘Esav (hairy) said, Let me now leave with you i [some] of the folk that [are] with me. And he said, Why do I need it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord [“There’s no need for my lord to be so kind to me”]."

Genesis,37,10,"And he told [it] to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What [is] this dream that you i have dreamed? Shall I and your i mother and your i brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to you i to the earth?"

Genesis,38,1,"And it came to pass at that time, that Y’hudah (Let the Powerful One be Praised [Yah]) went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain ‘Adulami (their testimony; their prey; their ornament; justice of the people) , whose name [was] Hirah."
Genesis,38,2,"And Y’hudah (Let the Powerful One be Praised [Yah]) saw there a daughter of a certain Kena’ani (merchants; traders; or those that humble and subdue) , whose name [was] Shua (to cry out for help) ; and he took her, and went in unto her."
Genesis,38,3,"And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name ‘Er (watchful; watchman)."

Genesis,38,7,"And ‘Er (watchful; watchman) , Y’hudah’s (Let the Powerful One be Praised [Yah]) firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) killed him."
Genesis,38,8,"And Y’hudah (Let the Powerful One be Praised [Yah]) said unto Onan (strong; pain, force, iniquity) , Go in unto your i brother’s wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to your i brother."
Genesis,38,9,"And Onan (strong; pain, force, iniquity) knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled [it] on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother."
Genesis,38,10,And the thing which he did displeased the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : For what reason he killed him also.
Genesis,38,11,"Then said Y’hudah to Tamar [palm-tree] his daughter in law, Remain a widow at your i father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest perhaps he die also, as his brethren [did] . And Tamar [palm-tree] went and dwelt in her father’s house."
Genesis,38,12,"And in process of time the daughter of Shua Y’hudah’s (Let the Powerful One be Praised [Yah]) wife died; and Y’hudah (Let the Powerful One be Praised [Yah]) was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnah [Portion] (place of forbidding) , he and his friend Hirah (a noble family; liberty; anger) the ‘Adulami (their testimony; their prey; their ornament; justice of the people)."
Genesis,38,13,"And it was told Tamar [palm-tree] (bitterness, palm tree) , saying, Behold your i father in law goes up to Timnah [Portion] (place of forbidding) to shear his sheep."
Genesis,38,14,"And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which [is] by the way to Timnah [Portion] (place of forbidding) ; for she saw that Shelah (Sent Out, Branch or Javelin; to prosper, rest) was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife."
Genesis,38,15,"When Y’hudah (Let the Powerful One be Praised [Yah]) saw her, he thought her [to be] an prostitute; because she had covered her face."
Genesis,38,16,"And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray you i , let me come in unto you i; (for he knew not that she [was] his daughter in law.) And she said, What will you i give me, that you i may come in unto me?"
Genesis,38,17,"And he said, I will send [you i ] a kid from the flock. And she said, Will you i give [me] a pledge, till you i send [it]?"
Genesis,38,18,"And he said, What pledge shall I give you i ? And she said, your i signet (seal or stamp) , and your i bracelets, and your i staff that [is] in your i hand. And he gave [it] her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him."
Genesis,38,19,"And she arose, and went away, and laid by her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood."
Genesis,38,20,"And Y’hudah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the ‘Adulami, to receive [his] pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found her not."
Genesis,38,21,"Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where [is] the prostitute, that [was] openly by the way side? And they said, There was no prostitute in this [place]."
Genesis,38,22,"And he returned to Y’hudah (Let the Powerful One be Praised [Yah]) , and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, [that] there was no prostitute in this [place]."
Genesis,38,23,"And Y’hudah said, Let her take [it] to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and you i hast not found her."
Genesis,38,24,"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Y’hudah, saying, Tamar [palm-tree] (bitterness, palm tree) your i daughter in law has played the prostitute; and also, behold, she [is] with child by whoredom. And Y’hudah (Let the Powerful One be Praised [Yah]) said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt."
Genesis,38,25,"When she [was] brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these [are, am] I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray you i , whose [are] these, the signet (seal or stamp) , and bracelets, and staff."
Genesis,38,26,"And Y’hudah (Let the Powerful One be Praised [Yah]) acknowledged [them] , and said, She has been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah (Sent Out, Branch or Javelin; to prosper, rest) my son. And he knew her again no more."
Genesis,38,27,"And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins [were] in her womb."
Genesis,38,28,"And it came to pass, when she travailed, that [the one] put out [his] hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first."
Genesis,38,29,"And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast you i broken forth? [this] breach (breaking forth; a break; opening, inlet) [be] upon you i : therefore his name was called Peretz (a breach (breaking forth; a break; opening, inlet); divided; rupture)."
Genesis,38,30,"And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zerach (a rising [as the sun], scarlet)."
Genesis,39,1,"And Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) was brought down to Mitzrayim [Egypt] (Double Distress or Double Stronghold, Black Land) ; and Potifar (He Whom The Ra Gave, Priest of the Bull, belonging to the sun) , an officer of Pharaoh (Great House) , captain of the guard, an Mitzrayimot (People of the Black Land) , bought him of the hands of the Yishma’elim (They Will Hear God [EL]) , which had brought him down there."
Genesis,39,2,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was with Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) , and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Mitzrayimot."
Genesis,39,3,"And his master saw that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [was] with him, and that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) made all that he did to prosper in his hand."
Genesis,39,4,"And Yosef found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all [that] he had he put into his hand."
Genesis,39,5,"And it came to pass from the time [that] he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) the Mitzrayimi house for Yosef’s sake; and the blessing of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field."
Genesis,39,6,"And he left all that he had in Yosef’s (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Yosef was [a] goodly [person] , and well favoured."
Genesis,39,7,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Yosef; and she said, Lie with me."
Genesis,39,8,"But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master knows not what [is] with me in the house, and he has committed all that he has to my hand;"
Genesis,39,9," [There is] none greater in this house than I; neither has he kept back anything from me but you i , because you i [are] his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered]?"
Genesis,39,10,"And it came to pass, as she spoke to Yosef day by day, that he listened not unto her, to lie by her, [or] to be with her."

Genesis,39,12,"And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out."
Genesis,39,13,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,"
Genesis,39,14,"That she called unto the men of her house, and spoke unto them, saying, See, he has brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:"
Genesis,39,15,"And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out."
Genesis,39,16,"And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home."
Genesis,39,17,"And she spoke unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which you i have brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:"
Genesis,39,18,"And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out."
Genesis,39,19,"And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke unto him, saying, After this manner did your i servant to me; that his wrath was kindled."
Genesis,39,20,"And Yosef’s (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners [were] bound: and he was there in the prison."
Genesis,39,21,"But the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was with Yosef, and showed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison."
Genesis,39,22,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Yosef’s hand all the prisoners that [were] in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer [of it]."
Genesis,39,23,"The keeper of the prison looked not to anything [that was] under his hand; because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was with him, and [that] which he did, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) made [it] to prosper."
Genesis,40,1,"And it came to pass after these things, [that] the butler of the king of Mitzrayim [Egypt] (Double Distress or Double Stronghold, Black Land) and [his] baker had offended their lord the king of Mitzrayim [Egypt]"
Genesis,40,2,"And Pharaoh (Great House) was exceedingly angry against two [of] his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers."
Genesis,40,3,"And he put them in ward (in custody, with a guard; prison) in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) [was] bound."
Genesis,40,4,"And the captain of the guard charged Yosef with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward (in custody, with a guard; prison)."
Genesis,40,5,"And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Mitzrayim [Egypt] , which [were] bound in the prison."
Genesis,40,6,"And Yosef came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they [were] sad."
Genesis,40,7,"And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that [were] with him in the ward (in custody, with a guard; prison) of his lord’s house, saying, For what reason look you f [so] sadly to day?"
Genesis,40,8,"And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and [there is] no interpreter of it. And Yosef said unto them, [Do] not interpretations [belong] to God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] ? tell me [them] , I pray you."
Genesis,40,9,"And the chief butler told his dream to Yosef, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine [was] before me;"
Genesis,40,10,"And in the vine [were] three branches: and it [was] as though it budded, [and] her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:"
Genesis,40,11,"And Pharaoh’s cup [was] in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand."
Genesis,40,12,"And Yosef said unto him, This [is] the interpretation of it: The three branches [are] three days:"
Genesis,40,13,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your i head, and restore you i unto your i place: and you i shall deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when you i were his butler."
Genesis,40,14,"But think on me when it shall be well with you i , and show kindness, I pray you i , unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh (Great House) , and bring me out of this house:"
Genesis,40,15,For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
Genesis,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Yosef, I also [was] in my dream, and, behold, [I had] three white baskets on my head:"
Genesis,40,17,"And in the uppermost basket [there was] of all manner of bakemeats [works of the baker, such as biscuits and cakes] for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head."
Genesis,40,18,"And Yosef answered and said, This [is] the interpretation thereof: The three baskets [are] three days:"
Genesis,40,19,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your i head from off you i , and shall hang you i on a tree; and the birds shall eat your i flesh from off you i."
Genesis,40,20,"And it came to pass the third day, [which was] Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants."
Genesis,40,21,And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:
Genesis,40,22,But he hanged the chief baker: as Yosef had interpreted to them.
Genesis,40,23,"Yet did not the chief butler remember Yosef, but forgot him."
Genesis,41,1,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh (Great House) dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river."
Genesis,41,2,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured cows and fatfleshed [plump] ; and they fed in a meadow."
Genesis,41,3,"And, behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed [emaciated] ; and stood by the [other] cows upon the brink of the river."
Genesis,41,4,And the ill favoured and leanfleshed cows did eat up the seven well favoured and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.
Genesis,41,5,"And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good."
Genesis,41,6,"And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them."
Genesis,41,7,"And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, [it was] a dream."
Genesis,41,8,"And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Mitzrayim [Egypt] , and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but [there was] none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,9,"Then spoke the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:"
Genesis,41,10,"Pharaoh was exceedingly angry with his servants, and put me in ward (in custody, with a guard; prison) in the captain of the guard’s house, [both] me and the chief baker:"
Genesis,41,11,"And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream."
Genesis,41,12,"And [there was] there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret."
Genesis,41,13,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto my office, and him he hanged."
Genesis,41,14,"Then Pharaoh (Great House) sent and called Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah] ), and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved [himself] , and changed his clothing, and came in unto Pharaoh."
Genesis,41,15,"And Pharaoh said unto Yosef, I have dreamed a dream, and [there is] none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of you i, [that] you i can understand a dream to interpret it."
Genesis,41,16,"And Yosef answered Pharaoh, saying, [It is] not in me: God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace."
Genesis,41,17,"And Pharaoh said unto Yosef, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:"
Genesis,41,18,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:"
Genesis,41,19,"And, behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt] for badness:"
Genesis,41,20,And the lean and the ill favoured cows did eat up the first seven fat cows:
Genesis,41,21,"And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they [were] still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke."
Genesis,41,22,"And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:"
Genesis,41,23,"And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:"
Genesis,41,24,And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told [this] unto the magicians; but [there was] none that could declare [it] to me.
Genesis,41,25,"And Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) said unto Pharaoh (Great House) , The dream of Pharaoh [is] one: God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] has showed Pharaoh what he [is] about to do."
Genesis,41,26,The seven good cows [are] seven years; and the seven good ears [are] seven years: the dream [is] one.
Genesis,41,27,And the seven thin and ill favoured cows that came up after them [are] seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
Genesis,41,28,This [is] the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] [is] about to do he shows unto Pharaoh.
Genesis,41,29,"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt] (Double Distress or Double Stronghold, Black Land):"
Genesis,41,30,"And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt] (Double Distress or Double Stronghold, Black Land) ; and the famine shall consume the land;"
Genesis,41,31,And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it [shall be] very grievous.
Genesis,41,32,"And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; [it is] because the thing [is] established by God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] , and God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] will shortly bring it to pass."
Genesis,41,33,"Now therefore let Pharaoh (Great House) look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt] (Double Distress or Double Stronghold, Black Land)."
Genesis,41,34,"Let Pharaoh do [this] , and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt] in the seven plenteous years."
Genesis,41,35,"And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities."
Genesis,41,36,"And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt] ; that the land perish not through the famine."
Genesis,41,37,"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh (Great House) , and in the eyes of all his servants."
Genesis,41,38,"And Pharaoh (Great House) said unto his servants, Can we find [such a one] as this [is] , a man in whom the Spirit of God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] [is]?"
Genesis,41,39,"And Pharaoh (Great House) said unto Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah] ), Forasmuch as God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] has showed you i all this, [there is] none so discreet and wise as you i [are]:"
Genesis,41,40,"You i shall be over my house, and according unto your i word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than you i."
Genesis,41,41,"And Pharaoh (Great House) said unto Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) , See, I have set you i over all the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt]."
Genesis,41,42,"And Pharaoh (Great House) took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Yosef’s (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;"
Genesis,41,43,"And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him [ruler] over all the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt] (Double Distress or Double Stronghold, Black Land)."
Genesis,41,44,"And Pharaoh (Great House) said unto Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) , I am Pharaoh (Great House) , and without you i shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt] (Double Distress or Double Stronghold, Black Land)."
Genesis,41,45,"And Pharaoh called Yosef’s (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) name Tzafnat-Pa’neach (Treasury of the Glorious Rest; Revealer of the Secrets of Life) : and he gave him to wife Asenath (gift of the water) the daughter of Osnat the daughter of Poti-Fera priest of On (belonging to the sun-god; he whom Ra gave) [On = meaning sun-city; Heliopolis] . And Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) went out over [all] the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt] (Double Distress or Double Stronghold, Black Land)."
Genesis,41,46,"And Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) [was] thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh (Great House) king of Mitzrayim [Egypt] (Double Distress or Double Stronghold, Black Land) . And Yosef went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt]."
Genesis,41,47,And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
Genesis,41,48,"And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt] , and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which [was] round about every city, laid he up in the same."
Genesis,41,49,"And Yosef gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for [it was] without number."
Genesis,41,50,"And unto Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Osnat (gift of the water) the daughter of Poti-Fera (belonging to the sun-god; he whom Ra gave) priest of On (meaning sun-city; Heliopolis) bore unto him."
Genesis,41,51,"And Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) called the name of the firstborn M’nasheh (causing to forget; from a debt) : For God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered], [said he] , has made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house."
Genesis,41,52,And the name of the second he called Efrayim (Out of the Ashes I am Fruitful; fruitful in affliction) : For God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
Genesis,41,53,"And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt] (Double Distress or Double Stronghold, Black Land) , were ended."
Genesis,41,54,"And the seven years of famine began to ome, according as Yosef had said: and the famine was in all lands; but in all the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt] there was bread."
Genesis,41,55,"And when all the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt] (Double Distress or Double Stronghold, Black Land) was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh (Great House) for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Mitzrayimot [Egyptians] (People of the Black Land) , Go unto Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah] ); what he says to you, do."
Genesis,41,56,"And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Yosef opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Mitzrayimot [Egyptians] Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt]."
Genesis,41,57,And all countries came into Mitzrayim [Egypt] to Yosef for to buy [corn] ; because that the famine was [so] sore in all lands.
Genesis,42,1,"Now when Ya’akov (he who holds onto the heel of) saw that there was corn in Mitzrayim [Egypt] (Double Distress or Double Stronghold, Black Land) , Ya’akov said unto his sons, Why do you f look one upon another?"
Genesis,42,2,"And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Mitzrayim [Egypt] : get you down there, and buy for us from there; that we may live, and not die."
Genesis,42,3,"Yosef’s (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) ten brethren went down to buy corn in Mitzrayim [Egypt] (Double Distress or Double Stronghold, Black Land)."
Genesis,42,4,"But Binyamin (This Son Is Strength) , Yosef’s (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) brother, Ya’akov (he who holds onto the heel of) sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest perhaps mischief befall him."
Genesis,42,5,And the sons of Isra’el (he who holds onto God-The Creator) came to buy [corn] among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Kena’an (merchant; trader; or that humbles and subdues).
Genesis,42,6,"And Yosef [was] the governor over the land, [and] he [it was] that sold to all the people of the land: and Yosef’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him [with] their faces to the earth."
Genesis,42,7,"And Yosef saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spoke roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come you f ? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food."
Genesis,42,8,"And Yosef knew his brethren, but they knew not him."
Genesis,42,9,"And Yosef remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, You 1sf [are] spies; to see the nakedness of the land you 1sf are come."
Genesis,42,10,"And they said unto him, No, my lord, but to buy food are your i servants come."
Genesis,42,11,"We [are] all one man’s sons; we [are] true [men] , your i servants are no spies."
Genesis,42,12,"And he said unto them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land you f are come."
Genesis,42,13,"And they said, your i servants [are] twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Kena’an (merchant; trader; or that humbles and subdues) ; and, behold, the youngest [is] this day with our father, and one [is] not."
Genesis,42,14,"And Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) said unto them, That [is it] that I spoke unto you, saying, You 1sf [are] spies:"
Genesis,42,15,"Hereby you 1sf shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh (Great House) you 1sf shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come to this place (till this point in time)."
Genesis,42,16,"Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and you 1sf shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether [there be any] tin you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you 1sf [are] spies."
Genesis,42,17,"And he put them all to (to do entirely, do wholly) gether into ward (in custody, with a guard; prison) three days."
Genesis,42,18,"And Yosef said unto them the third day, This do, and live; [for] I fear God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered]:"
Genesis,42,19,"If you 1sf [be] true [men] , let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go you 1sf , carry corn for the famine of your houses:"
Genesis,42,20,"But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and you f shall not die. And they did so."
Genesis,42,21,"And they said one to another, We [are] truly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us."
Genesis,42,22,"And Re’uven (behold a son) answered them, saying, Spoke I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and you f would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required."
Genesis,42,23,And they knew not that Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) understood [them] ; for he spoke unto them by an interpreter.
Genesis,42,24,"And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Shim’on (heard; he who hears; man of hearing) , and bound him before their eyes."
Genesis,42,25,"Then Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and in this way did he unto them."
Genesis,42,26,"And they laded their donkeys with the corn, and departed there."
Genesis,42,27,"And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey provender (food for livestock or cattle) in the inn, he discovered (spied out; examined) his money; for, behold, it [was] in his sack’s mouth."
Genesis,42,28,"And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, [it is] even in my sack: and their heart failed [them] , and they were afraid, saying one to another, What [is] this [that] God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] has done unto us?"
Genesis,42,29,"And they came unto Ya’akov (he who holds onto the heel of) their father unto the land of Kena’an (merchant; trader; or that humbles and subdues) , and told him all that befell unto them; saying,"
Genesis,42,30,"The man, [who is] the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country."
Genesis,42,31,"And we said unto him, We [are] true [men] ; we are no spies:"
Genesis,42,32,"We [be] twelve brethren, sons of our father; one [is] not, and the youngest [is] this day with our father in the land of Kena’an (merchant; trader; or that humbles and subdues)."
Genesis,42,33,"And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that you 1sf [are] true [men] ; leave one of yourf brethren [here] with me, and take [food for] the famine of yourf households, and be gone:"
Genesis,42,34,"And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that you 1sf [are] not spies, but [that] you 1sf [are] true [men: so] will I deliver [to] you f yourf brother, and you 1sf shall traffick (trade; do business) [engage in illegal activity] in the land."
Genesis,42,35,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money [was] in his sack: and when [both] they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid."
Genesis,42,36,"And Ya’akov (he who holds onto the heel of) their father said unto them, Me have you f bereaved [of my children] : Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) [is] not, and Shim’on (heard; he who hears; man of hearing) [is] not, and you 1sf will take Binyamin (This Son Is Strength) [away] : all these things are against me."
Genesis,42,37,"And Re’uven (behold a son) spoke unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to you i : deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to you i again."
Genesis,42,38,"And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which you 1sf go, then shall you 1sf bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
Genesis,43,1,And the famine [was] sore in the land.
Genesis,43,2,"And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Mitzrayim [Egypt] (Double Distress or Double Stronghold, Black Land) , their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food."
Genesis,43,3,"And Y’hudah (Let the Powerful One be Praised [Yah]) spoke unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, You 1sf shall not see my face, except your brother [be] with you."
Genesis,43,4,"If you i will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you i food:"
Genesis,43,5,"But if you i will not send [him] , we will not go down: for the man said unto us, You 1sf shall not see my face, except your brother [be] with you."
Genesis,43,6,"And Isra’el (he who holds onto God-The Creator) said, For what reason have you 1sf dealt [so] ill with me, [as] to tell the man whether you 1sf had yet a brother?"
Genesis,43,7,"And they said, The man asked us rigorously of our state, and of our family, saying, [Is] yourf father yet alive? have you f [another] brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?"
Genesis,43,8,"And Y’hudah (Let the Powerful One be Praised [Yah]) said unto Isra’el (he who holds onto God-The Creator) his father, Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and you i, [and] also our little ones."
Genesis,43,9,"I will be surety for him; of my hand shall you i require him: if I bring him not unto you i , and set him before you i , then let me bear the blame for ever:"
Genesis,43,10,"For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time."
Genesis,43,11,"And their father Isra’el (he who holds onto God-The Creator) said unto them, If [it must be] so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in yourf vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm (a medicine; rosin from a bush) , and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:"
Genesis,43,12,"And take double money in yourf hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of yourf sacks, carry [it] again in yourf hand; perhaps it [was] an oversight:"
Genesis,43,13,"Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:"
Genesis,43,14,"And EL Shaddai [God Almighty] (The Powerful Creator) give you f mercy before the man, that he may send away yourf other brother, and Binyamin. If I be bereaved [of my children] , I am bereaved."
Genesis,43,15,"And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Binyamin; and rose up, and went down to Mitzrayim [Egypt] , and stood before Yosef."
Genesis,43,16,"And when Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) saw Binyamin (This Son Is Strength) with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring [these] men home, and slay, and make ready; for [these] men shall dine with me at noon."
Genesis,43,17,And the man did as Yosef bade; and the man brought the men into Yosef’s house.
Genesis,43,18,"And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Yosef’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our donkeys."
Genesis,43,19,"And they came near to the steward of Yosef’s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,"
Genesis,43,20,"And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:"
Genesis,43,21,"And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, [every] man’s money [was] in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand."
Genesis,43,22,And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
Genesis,43,23,"And he said, Peace [be] to you, fear not: yourf God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] , and the God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] of yourf father, has given you f treasure in yourf sacks: I had yourf money. And he brought Shim’on (heard; he who hears; man of hearing) out unto them."
Genesis,43,24,"And the man brought the men into Yosef’s house, and gave [them] water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys provender (food for livestock or cattle)."
Genesis,43,25,And they made ready the present against Yosef came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
Genesis,43,26,"And when Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) came home, they brought him the present which [was] in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth."
Genesis,43,27,"And he asked them of [their] welfare, and said, [Is] yourf father well, the old man of whom you f spoke? [Is] he yet alive?"
Genesis,43,28,"And they answered, your i servant our father [is] in good health, he [is] yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obesiance (bowing or kneeling in respect)."
Genesis,43,29,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Binyamin (This Son Is Strength) , his mother’s son, and said, [Is] this yourf younger brother, of whom you f spoke unto me? And he said, God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] be gracious unto you i , my son."
Genesis,43,30,"And Yosef made haste; for his bowels (inward parts; affections) did yearn upon his brother: and he sought [where] to weep; and he entered into [his] chamber, and wept there."
Genesis,43,31,"And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread."
Genesis,43,32,"And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Mitzrayimot [Egyptians] , which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Mitzrayimot [Egyptians] (People of the Black Land) might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that [is] an abomination unto the Mitzrayimot [Egyptians]"
Genesis,43,33,"And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marveled one at another."
Genesis,43,34,"And he took [and sent] messes unto them from before him: but Binyamin’s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him."
Genesis,44,1,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks [with] food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth."
Genesis,44,2,"And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Yosef had spoken."
Genesis,44,3,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys."
Genesis,44,4," [And] when they were gone out of the city, [and] not [yet] far off, Yosef said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when you i do overtake them, say unto them, For what reason have you f rewarded evil for good?"
Genesis,44,5," [Is] not this [it] in which my lord drinks, and whereby indeed he divines? You 1sf have done evil in so doing."
Genesis,44,6,"And he overtook them, and he spoke unto them these same words."
Genesis,44,7,"And they said unto him, For what reason says my lord these words? God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] forbid that your i servants should do according to this thing:"
Genesis,44,8,"Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto you i out of the land of Kena’an (merchant; trader; or that humbles and subdues) : how then should we steal out of your i lord’s house silver or gold?"
Genesis,44,9,"With whomsoever of your i servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen."
Genesis,44,10,"And he said, Now also [let] it [be] according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and you f shall be blameless."
Genesis,44,11,"Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack."
Genesis,44,12,"And he searched, [and] began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Binyamin’s (this son is strength) sack."
Genesis,44,13,"Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his donkey, and returned to the city."
Genesis,44,14,And Y’hudah (Let the Powerful One be Praised [Yah]) and his brethren came to Yosef’s (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) house; for he [was] yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
Genesis,44,15,"And Yosef said unto them, What deed [is] this that you 1sf have done? know you 1sf not that such a man as I can certainly divine?"
Genesis,44,16,"And Y’hudah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] has found out the iniquity of your i servants: behold, we [are] my lord’s servants, both we, and [he] also with whom the cup is found."
Genesis,44,17,"And he said, God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] forbid that I should do so: [but] the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you i up in peace unto your father."
Genesis,44,18,"Then Y’hudah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let you i servant, I pray you i , speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not your i anger burn against your i servant: for you i [are] even as Pharaoh (Great House)."
Genesis,44,19,"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have you f a father, or a brother?"
Genesis,44,20,"And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him."
Genesis,44,21,"And you i said unto you i servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set my eyes upon him."
Genesis,44,22,"And we said unto my lord, The boy cannot leave his father: for [if] he should leave his father, [his father] would die."
Genesis,44,23,"And you i said unto you i servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, you f shall see my face no more."
Genesis,44,24,"And it came to pass when we came up unto your i servant my father, we told him the words of my lord."
Genesis,44,25,"And our father said, Go again, [and] buy us a little food."
Genesis,44,26,"And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother [be] with us."
Genesis,44,27,"And your i servant my father said unto us, You 1sf know that my wife bore me two [sons]:"
Genesis,44,28,"And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:"
Genesis,44,29,"If you 1sf take this also from me, and mischief befall him, you 1sf shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
Genesis,44,30,"Now therefore when I come to your i servant my father, and the boy [be] not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the boy’s life;"
Genesis,44,31,"It shall come to pass, when he sees that the boy [is] not [with us] , that he will die: and your i servants shall bring down the gray hairs of your i servant our father with sorrow to the grave."
Genesis,44,32,"For your i servant became surety for the boy unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto you i , then I shall bear the blame to my father forever."
Genesis,44,33,"Now therefore, I pray you i , let your i servant abide instead of the boy a bondman (slave) to my lord; and let the boy go up with his brethren."
Genesis,44,34,"For how shall I go up to my father, and the boy [be] not with me? lest perhaps I see the evil that shall come on my father."
Genesis,45,1,"Then Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Yosef made himself known unto his brethren."
Genesis,45,2,And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
Genesis,45,3,"And Yosef said unto his brethren, I [am] Yosef; does my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence."
Genesis,45,4,"And Yosef (Increaser; May God the Powerful One add [Yah]) said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I [am] Yosef your brother, whom you f sold into Mitzrayim [Egypt]."
Genesis,45,5,"Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you f sold me to this place (till this point in time) : for God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] did send me before you i to preserve life."
Genesis,45,6,"For these two years [has] the famine [been] in the land: and yet [there are] five years, in the which [there shall] neither [be] earing nor harvest."
Genesis,45,7,"And God-Elōhīm [The Living Word - The Many Powered] sent me before you i to preserve you i a posterity in the earth, and to save your i lives by a great deliverance."
