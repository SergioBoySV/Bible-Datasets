2 Samuel,1,1,"Now it came to pass after the death of Sha’ul [desired] , when David [beloved] was returned from the slaughter of the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley] , and David [beloved] had abode two days in Ziklag [Winding];"
2 Samuel,1,2,"It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Sha’ul [desired] with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and [so] it was, when he came to David [beloved] , that he fell to the earth, and did obesiance (bowing or kneeling in respect)."
2 Samuel,1,3,"And David [beloved] said unto him, From where do you i come? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] am I escaped."
2 Samuel,1,4,"And David [beloved] said unto him, How went the matter? I pray you i , tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Sha’ul [desired] and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] his son are dead also."
2 Samuel,1,5,"And David [beloved] said unto the young man that told him, How know you i that Sha’ul [desired] and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] his son be dead?"
2 Samuel,1,6,"And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa [swollen heap] , behold, Sha’ul [desired] leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him."
2 Samuel,1,7,"And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here [am] I."
2 Samuel,1,8,"And he said unto me, Who [are] you i ? And I answered him, I [am] an ‘Amaleki [Dwellers in a Valley]."
2 Samuel,1,9,"He said unto me again, Stand, I pray you i , upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life [is] yet whole in me."
2 Samuel,1,10,"So I stood upon him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that [was] upon his head, and the bracelet that [was] on his arm, and have brought them here unto my lord."
2 Samuel,1,11,"Then David [beloved] took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that [were] with him:"
2 Samuel,1,12,"And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Sha’ul [desired] , and for Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] his son, and for the people of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and for the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; because they were fallen by the sword."
2 Samuel,1,13,"And David [beloved] said unto the young man that told him, Whence [are] you i ? And he answered, I [am] the son of a stranger, an ‘Amaleki [Dwellers in a Valley]."
2 Samuel,1,14,"And David [beloved] said unto him, How were you i not afraid to stretch forth you i hand to destroy the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] anointed?"
2 Samuel,1,15,"And David [beloved] called one of the young men, and said, Go near, [and] fall upon him. And he struck him that he died."
2 Samuel,1,16,"And David [beloved] said unto him, You 1s blood [be] upon you i head; for you i mouth has testified against you i , saying, I have slain the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] anointed."
2 Samuel,1,17,And David [beloved] lamented with this lamentation over Sha’ul [desired] and over Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] his son:
2 Samuel,1,18,"(Also he bade them teach the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] [the use of] the bow: behold, [it is] written in the book of Yahsar [Upright, Correct] .)"
2 Samuel,1,19,The beauty of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] is slain upon you i high places: how are the mighty fallen!
2 Samuel,1,20,"Tell [it] not in Gat [Winepress] , publish [it] not in the streets of Askelon [The Fire of Infamy: I shall be Weighed]; lest the daughters of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph."
2 Samuel,1,21,"You 2f mountains of Gilboa [swollen heap], [let there be] no dew, neither [let there be] rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Sha’ul [desired], [as though he had] not [been] anointed with oil."
2 Samuel,1,22,"From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] turned not back, and the sword of Sha’ul [desired] returned not empty."
2 Samuel,1,23,"Sha’ul [desired] and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] [were] lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions."
2 Samuel,1,24,"You 2f daughters of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , weep over Sha’ul [desired] , who clothed you in scarlet, with [other] delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel."
2 Samuel,1,25,"How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given], [you i were] slain in you i high places."
2 Samuel,1,26,"I am distressed for you i , my brother Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] : very pleasant have you i been unto me: you i love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women."
2 Samuel,1,27,"How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!"
2 Samuel,2,1,"And it came to pass after this, that David [beloved] enquired of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ? And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto him, Go up. And David [beloved] said, Where shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hevron [Seat of Association]."
2 Samuel,2,2,"So David [beloved] went up there, and his two wives also, Achino’am [my brother is delight] the Yizre’elit [God Sows] , and Avigayil [my father is joy] Naval [fool] ’s wife the Carmeli [garden-land]."
2 Samuel,2,3,"And his men that [were] with him did David [beloved] bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hevron [Seat of Association]."
2 Samuel,2,4,"And the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] came, and there they anointed David [beloved] king over the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] . And they told David [beloved] , saying, [That] the men of Yavesh-Gil’ad [Dry Hill of Testimony] [were they] that buried Sha’ul [desired]."
2 Samuel,2,5,"And David [beloved] sent messengers unto the men of Yavesh-Gil’ad [Dry Hill of Testimony] , and said unto them, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] you 2f of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that you 2f have showed this kindness unto your lord, [even] unto Sha’ul [desired] , and have buried him."
2 Samuel,2,6,"And now the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) show kindness and tunto you: and I also will requite (repay) you this kindness, because you 2f have done this thing."
2 Samuel,2,7,"Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be you 2f valiant: for your master Sha’ul [desired] is dead, and also the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] have anointed me king over them."
2 Samuel,2,8,"But Avner [my father is a lamp] the son of Ner [lamp] , captain of Sha’ul’s [desired] host, took Ish-Boshet [man of shame] the son of Sha’ul [desired] , and brought him over to Machanayim [Two Camps];"
2 Samuel,2,9,"And made him king over Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , and over the Ashuri [guided; Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)], and over Yizre’el [God Sows] , and over Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , and over Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , and over all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Samuel,2,10,"Ish-Boshet [man of shame] Sha’ul’s [desired] son [was] forty years old when he began to reign over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and reigned two years. But the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] followed David [beloved]."
2 Samuel,2,11,And the time that David [beloved] was king in Hevron [Seat of Association] over the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] was seven years and six months.
2 Samuel,2,12,"And Avner [my father is a lamp] the son of Ner [lamp] , and the servants of Ish-Boshet [man of shame] the son of Sha’ul [desired] , went out from Machanayim [Two Camps] to Giv’on [Hill City]."
2 Samuel,2,13,"And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] the son of Tz’ruyah [balsam] , and the servants of David [beloved] , went out, and met together by the pool of Giv’on [Hill City] : and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool."
2 Samuel,2,14,"And Avner [my father is a lamp] said to Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] said, Let them arise."
2 Samuel,2,15,"Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , which [pertained] to Ish-Boshet [man of shame] the son of Sha’ul [desired] , and twelve of the servants of David [beloved]."
2 Samuel,2,16,"And they caught everyone his fellow by the head, and [thrust] his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkat-Hatzurim [field of swords] , which [is] in Giv’on [Hill City]."
2 Samuel,2,17,"And there was a very sore battle that day; and Avner [my father is a lamp] was beaten, and the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , before the servants of David [beloved]."
2 Samuel,2,18,"And there were three sons of Tz’ruyah [balsam] there, Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , and Avishai [my father is a gift] , and ‘Asah’el [God-made] : and ‘Asah’el [God-made] [was as] light of foot as a wild roe."
2 Samuel,2,19,And ‘Asah’el [God-made] pursued after Avner [my father is a lamp] ; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Avner [my father is a lamp].
2 Samuel,2,20,"Then Avner [my father is a lamp] looked behind him, and said, [Are] you i ‘Asah’el [God-made] ? And he answered, I [am]."
2 Samuel,2,21,"And Avner [my father is a lamp] said to him, Turn you i aside to you i right hand or to you i left, and lay you i hold on one of the young men, and take you i his armour. But ‘Asah’el [God-made] would not turn aside from following of him."
2 Samuel,2,22,"And Avner [my father is a lamp] said again to ‘Asah’el [God-made] , Turn you i aside from following me: wherefore should I strike you i to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Yo’av [Yehovah is father] you i brother?"
2 Samuel,2,23,"However he refused to turn aside: wherefore Avner [my father is a lamp] with the behind (the back side; the rear) of the spear struck him under the fifth [rib] , that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, [that] as many as came to the place where ‘Asah’el [God-made] fell down and died stood still."
2 Samuel,2,24,"Yo’av [Yehovah is father] also and Avishai [my father is a gift] pursued after Avner [my father is a lamp] : and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Amah [a cubit] , that [lies] before Giach [to break forth] by the way of the wilderness of Giv’on [Hill City]."
2 Samuel,2,25,"And the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] gathered themselves together after Avner [my father is a lamp] , and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill."
2 Samuel,2,26,"Then Avner [my father is a lamp] called to Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , and said, Shall the sword devour forever? know you i not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, before you i bid the people return from following their brethren?"
2 Samuel,2,27,"And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] said, [As] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] lives, unless you i had spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up everyone from following his brother."
2 Samuel,2,28,"So Yo’av [Yehovah is father] blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] no more, neither fought they any more."
2 Samuel,2,29,"And Avner [my father is a lamp] and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Yarden [Descender] , and went through all Bitron [division, or cleft (split hoof; an opening, break or split) , or ravine], and they came to Machanayim [Two Camps]."
2 Samuel,2,30,"And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] returned from following Avner [my father is a lamp] : and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s [beloved] ’s servants nineteen men and ‘Asah’el [God-made]."
2 Samuel,2,31,"But the servants of David [beloved] had smitten of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , and of Avner [my father is a lamp] ’s men, [so that] three hundred and threescore men died."
2 Samuel,2,32,"And they took up ‘Asah’el [God-made] , and buried him in the sepulcher of his father, which [was in] Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] . And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] and his men went all night, and they came to Hevron [Seat of Association] at break of day."
2 Samuel,3,1,"Now there was long war between the house of Sha’ul [desired] and the house of David [beloved] : but David [beloved] waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Sha’ul [desired] waxed weaker and weaker."
2 Samuel,3,2,"And unto David [beloved] were sons born in Hevron [Seat of Association] : and his firstborn was Amnon [faithful] , of Achino’am [my brother is delight] the Yizre’elit [God Sows];"
2 Samuel,3,3,"And his second, Kil’av [like his father] , of Avigayil [my father is joy] the wife of Naval [fool] the Carmeli [garden-land] ; and the third, Avshalom [my father is peace] the son of Ma’akhah [oppression] [oppression] the daughter of Talmai [Plowman] king of G’shur [proud beholder];"
2 Samuel,3,4,"And the fourth, Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] the son of Haggit [festive] ; and the fifth, Sh’fatyah [Yehovah has judged] the son of Avital [my father is (the) dew];"
2 Samuel,3,5,"And the sixth, Yitre’am [profit of the people] , by ‘Eglah [a heifer] David’s [beloved] ’s wife. These were born to David [beloved] in Hevron [Seat of Association]."
2 Samuel,3,6,"And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Sha’ul [desired] and the house of David [beloved] , that Avner [my father is a lamp] made himself strong for the house of Sha’ul [desired]."
2 Samuel,3,7,"And Sha’ul [desired] had a concubine, whose name [was] Ritzpah [pavement] , the daughter of Ayah [falcon] : and [Ish-Boshet [man of shame] ] said to Avner [my father is a lamp] , For what reason have you i gone in unto my father’s concubine?"
2 Samuel,3,8,"Then was Avner [my father is a lamp] very exceedingly angry for the words of Ish-Boshet [man of shame] , and said, [Am] I a dog’s head, which against Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] do show kindness this day unto the house of Sha’ul [desired] you i father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered you i into the hand of David [beloved] , that you i charge me to day with a fault concerning this woman?"
2 Samuel,3,9,"So do God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] to Avner [my father is a lamp] , and more also, except, as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has sworn to David [beloved] , even so I do to him;"
2 Samuel,3,10,"To translate (transfer; remove to another place) the kingdom from the house of Sha’ul [desired] , and to set up the throne of David [beloved] over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and over Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , from Dan [Judge] even to Be’er-sheva [Well of the sevenfold Oath]."
2 Samuel,3,11,"And he could not answer Avner [my father is a lamp] a word again, because he feared him."
2 Samuel,3,12,"And Avner [my father is a lamp] sent messengers to David [beloved] on his behalf, saying, Whose [is] the land? saying [also] , Make your i league with me, and, behold, my hand [shall be] with you i , to bring about all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] unto you i."
2 Samuel,3,13,"And he said, Well; I will make a league with you i : but one thing I require of you i , that is, you i shall not see my face, except you i first bring Mikhal [who is like God?] Sha’ul’s [desired] daughter, when you i come to see my face."
2 Samuel,3,14,"And David [beloved] sent messengers to Ish-Boshet [man of shame] Sha’ul’s [desired] son, saying, Deliver [me] my wife Mikhal [who is like God?] , which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."
2 Samuel,3,15,"And Ish-Boshet [man of shame] sent, and took her from [her] husband, [even] from Palti’el [God delivers] the son of Layish [Lion]."
2 Samuel,3,16,"And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bachurim [young men’s Villiage] . Then said Avner [my father is a lamp] unto him, Go, return. And he returned."
2 Samuel,3,17,"And Avner [my father is a lamp] had communication with the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, You 2f sought for David [beloved] in times past [to be] king over you:"
2 Samuel,3,18,"Now then do [it] : for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has spoken of David [beloved] , saying, By the hand of my servant David [beloved] I will save my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of the hand of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and out of the hand of all their enemies."
2 Samuel,3,19,"And Avner [my father is a lamp] also spoke in the ears of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] : and Avner [my father is a lamp] went also to speak in the ears of David [beloved] in Hevron [Seat of Association] all that seemed good to Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and that seemed good to the whole house of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength]."
2 Samuel,3,20,"So Avner [my father is a lamp] came to David [beloved] to Hevron [Seat of Association] , and twenty men with him. And David [beloved] made Avner [my father is a lamp] and the men that [were] with him a feast."
2 Samuel,3,21,"And Avner [my father is a lamp] said unto David [beloved] , I will arise and go, and will gather all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with you i , and that you i may reign over all that you i heart desires. And David [beloved] sent Avner [my father is a lamp] away; and he went in peace."
2 Samuel,3,22,"And, behold, the servants of David [beloved] and Yo’av [Yehovah is father] came from [pursuing] a troop, and brought in a great spoil (plunder; prey; booty) with them: but Avner [my father is a lamp] [was] not with David [beloved] in Hevron [Seat of Association] ; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace."
2 Samuel,3,23,"When Yo’av [Yehovah is father] and all the host that [was] with him were come, they told Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , saying, Avner [my father is a lamp] the son of Ner [lamp] came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace."
2 Samuel,3,24,"Then Yo’av [Yehovah is father] came to the king, and said, What have you i done? behold, Avner [my father is a lamp] came unto you i ; why [is] it [that] you i have sent him away, and he is quite gone?"
2 Samuel,3,25,"you i know Avner [my father is a lamp] the son of Ner [lamp] , that he came to deceive you i , and to know your i going out and your i coming in, and to know all that you i do."
2 Samuel,3,26,"And when Yo’av [Yehovah is father] was come out from David [beloved] , he sent messengers after Avner [my father is a lamp] , which brought him again from the well of Sirah [the turning] : but David [beloved] knew [it] not."
2 Samuel,3,27,"And when Avner [my father is a lamp] was returned to Hevron [Seat of Association] , Yo’av [Yehovah is father] took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck him there under the fifth [rib] , that he died, for the blood of ‘Asah’el [God-made] his brother."
2 Samuel,3,28,"And afterward when David [beloved] heard [it] , he said, I and my kingdom [are] guiltless before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) forever from the blood of Avner [my father is a lamp] the son of Ner [lamp]:"
2 Samuel,3,29,"Let it rest on the head of Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , and on all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Yo’av [Yehovah is father] one that has an issue (what comes forth) , or that is a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls on the sword, or that lacks bread."
2 Samuel,3,30,"So Yo’av [Yehovah is father] and Avishai [my father is a gift] his brother killed Avner [my father is a lamp] , because he had slain their brother ‘Asah’el [God-made] at Giv’on [Hill City] in the battle."
2 Samuel,3,31,"And David [beloved] said to Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , and to all the people that [were] with him, Rend (tear apart; forcefully rip apart) your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Avner [my father is a lamp] . And king David [beloved] [himself] followed the bier."
2 Samuel,3,32,"And they buried Avner [my father is a lamp] in Hevron [Seat of Association] : and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Avner [my father is a lamp] ; and all the people wept."
2 Samuel,3,33,"And the king lamented over Avner [my father is a lamp] , and said, Died Avner [my father is a lamp] as a fool dies?"
2 Samuel,3,34,"Your 1s hands [were] not bound, nor your i feet put into fetters: as a man falls before wicked men, [so] fell you i . And all the people wept again over him."
2 Samuel,3,35,"And when all the people came to cause David [beloved] to eat meat while it was yet day, David [beloved] swore, saying, So do God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down."
2 Samuel,3,36,"And all the people took notice [of it] , and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people."
2 Samuel,3,37,For all the people and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Avner [my father is a lamp] the son of Ner [lamp].
2 Samuel,3,38,"And the king said unto his servants, Know you 2f not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
2 Samuel,3,39,"And I [am] this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Tz’ruyah [balsam] [be] too hard for me: the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness."
2 Samuel,4,1,"And when Sha’ul’s [desired] son heard that Avner [my father is a lamp] was dead in Hevron [Seat of Association] , his hands were feeble, and all the Yisra’eli’s were troubled."
2 Samuel,4,2,"And Sha’ul’s [desired] son had two men [that were] captains of bands: the name of the one [was] Ba’anah [in affliction] , and the name of the other Rekhav [rider] , the sons of Rimmon [Pomegranate] a Be’erot [wells] , of the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] (for B’erot [Wells] also was reckoned to Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength]:"
2 Samuel,4,3,"And the Be’erotim [wells] fled to Gittayim [two winepresses] , and were sojourners there until this day.)"
2 Samuel,4,4,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] , Sha’ul’s [desired] son, had a son [that was] lame of [his] feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Sha’ul [desired] and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] out of Yizre’el [God Sows] , and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name [was] M’fivoshet [exterminating the idol]."
2 Samuel,4,5,"And the sons of Rimmon [Pomegranate] the Be’erot [wells] , Rekhav [rider] and Ba’anah [in affliction] , went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-Boshet [man of shame] , who lay on a bed at noon."
2 Samuel,4,6,"And they came there into the midst of the house, [as though] they would have fetched wheat; and they struck him under the fifth [rib] : and Rekhav [rider] and Ba’anah [in affliction] his brother escaped."
2 Samuel,4,7,"For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they struck him, and killed him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and got them away through the plain all night."
2 Samuel,4,8,"And they brought the head of Ish-Boshet [man of shame] unto David [beloved] to Hevron [Seat of Association] , and said to the king, Behold the head of Ish-Boshet [man of shame] the son of Sha’ul [desired] your i enemy, which sought you i life; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has avenged my lord the king this day of Sha’ul [desired] , and of his seed."
2 Samuel,4,9,"And David [beloved] answered Rekhav [rider] and Ba’anah [in affliction] his brother, the sons of Rimmon [Pomegranate] the Be’erot [wells] , and said unto them, [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,"
2 Samuel,4,10,"When one told me, saying, Behold, Sha’ul [desired] is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and killed him in Ziklag [Winding] , who [thought] that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:"
2 Samuel,4,11,"How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?"
2 Samuel,4,12,"And David [beloved] commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged [them] up over the pool in Hevron [Seat of Association] . But they took the head of Ish-Boshet [man of shame] , and buried [it] in the sepulcher of Avner [my father is a lamp] in Hevron [Seat of Association]."
2 Samuel,5,1,"Then came all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to David [beloved] unto Hevron [Seat of Association] , and spoke, saying, Behold, we [are] you i bone and you i flesh."
2 Samuel,5,2,"Also in time past, when Sha’ul [desired] was king over us, you i were he that led out and brought in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said to you i , you i shall feed my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and you i shall be a captain over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Samuel,5,3,So all the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came to the king to Hevron [Seat of Association] ; and king David [beloved] made a league with them in Hevron [Seat of Association] before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and they anointed David [beloved] king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
2 Samuel,5,4,"David [beloved] [was] thirty years old when he began to reign, [and] he reigned forty years."
2 Samuel,5,5,In Hevron [Seat of Association] he reigned over Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] seven years and six months: and in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] he reigned thirty and three years over all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised].
2 Samuel,5,6,"And the king and his men went to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] unto the Y’vusi [Threshers, Trampled Under Foot] , the inhabitants of the land: which spoke unto David [beloved] , saying, Except you i take away the blind and the lame, you i shall not come in here: thinking, David [beloved] cannot come in here."
2 Samuel,5,7,Nevertheless David [beloved] took the strong hold of Tziyon [parched place] : the same [is] the city of David [beloved].
2 Samuel,5,8,"And David [beloved] said on that day, Whosoever gets up to the gutter, and smites the Y’vusi [Threshers, Trampled Under Foot] , and the lame and the blind, [that are] hated of David’s [beloved] ’s soul, [he shall be chief and captain] . For what reason they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house."
2 Samuel,5,9,"So David [beloved] dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David [beloved] . And David [beloved] built round about from Millo [fortification (defensive structure) or mound] and inward."
2 Samuel,5,10,"And David [beloved] went on, and grew great, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] [was] with him."
2 Samuel,5,11,"And Hiram [noble] king of Tzor (Tyre) [a rock] sent messengers to David [beloved] , and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David [beloved] an house."
2 Samuel,5,12,"And David [beloved] perceived that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had established him king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Yisra’el’s [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] sake."
2 Samuel,5,13,"And David [beloved] took [him] more concubines and wives out of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , after he was come from Hevron [Seat of Association] : and there were yet sons and daughters born to David [beloved]."
2 Samuel,5,14,"And these [be] the names of those that were born unto him in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; Shamua [Renowned] , and Shovav [rebellious] , and Natan [giver] , and Shlomo (Solomon) [peace],"
2 Samuel,5,15,"Yivchar [Yehovah chooses] also, and Elishua [my God is wealth] , and Nefeg [Weak, Slacked] , and Yafia [Shining],"
2 Samuel,5,16,"And Elishama [My God has Heard] , and El-yada [God knows] , and Elifelet [God is deliverance]."
2 Samuel,5,17,"But when the P’lishtim [Immigrants] heard that they had anointed David [beloved] king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , all the P’lishtim [Immigrants] came up to seek David [beloved] ; and David [beloved] heard [of it] , and went down to the hold."
2 Samuel,5,18,The P’lishtim [Immigrants] also came and spread themselves in the valley of Refa’im [giants].
2 Samuel,5,19,"And David [beloved] enquired of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, Shall I go up to the P’lishtim [Immigrants] ? will you i deliver them into my hand? And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto David [beloved] , Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the P’lishtim [Immigrants] into you i hand."
2 Samuel,5,20,"And David [beloved] came to Ba’al-P’ratzim [lord of the breaks] , and David [beloved] struck them there, and said, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has broken forth upon my enemies before me, as the breach (breaking forth; a break; opening, inlet) of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Ba’al-P’ratzim [lord of the breaks]."
2 Samuel,5,21,"And there they left their images, and David [beloved] and his men burned them."
2 Samuel,5,22,"And the P’lishtim [Immigrants] came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Refa’im [giants]."
2 Samuel,5,23,"And when David [beloved] enquired of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , he said, you i shall not go up; [but] fetch a compass (go around, encircle; encompass) behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees."
2 Samuel,5,24,"And let it be, when you i hear the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you i shall bestir yourself: for then shall the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) go out before you i , to strike the host of the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."
2 Samuel,5,25,"And David [beloved] did so, as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had commanded him; and struck the P’lishtim [Immigrants] from Geva [hill] until you i come to Gezer [portion]."
2 Samuel,6,1,"Again, David [beloved] gathered together all [the] chosen [men] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , thirty thousand."
2 Samuel,6,2,"And David [beloved] arose, and went with all the people that [were] with him from Ba’alei [the lords] of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , to bring up from there the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , whose name is called by the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] that dwells [between] the k’vurim (cherubim)."
2 Samuel,6,3,"And they set the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Avinadav [my father is noble] that [was] in Giv’ah [Hill] : and ‘Uzah [strength] and Achyo [brotherly or fraternal] , the sons of Avinadav [my father is noble] , drove the new cart."
2 Samuel,6,4,"And they brought it out of the house of Avinadav [my father is noble] which [was] at Giv’ah [Hill] , accompanying the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : and Achyo [brotherly or fraternal] went before the ark."
2 Samuel,6,5,"And David [beloved] and all the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] played before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) on all manner of [instruments made of] fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals."
2 Samuel,6,6,"And when they came to Nakhon’s [prepared] threshing floor, ‘Uzah [strength] put forth [his hand] to the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and took hold of it; for the oxen shook [it]."
2 Samuel,6,7,And the anger of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was kindled against ‘Uzah [strength] ; and God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] struck him there for [his] error; and there he died by the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered].
2 Samuel,6,8,"And David [beloved] was displeased, because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had made a breach (breaking forth; a break; opening, inlet) upon ‘Uzah [strength] : and he called the name of the place Peretz-’Uzah [breach (breaking forth; a break; opening, inlet) of strength] to this day."
2 Samuel,6,9,"And David [beloved] was afraid of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) that day, and said, How shall the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) come to me?"
2 Samuel,6,10,So David [beloved] would not remove the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto him into the city of David [beloved] : but David [beloved] carried it aside into the house of ‘Oved-Edom [servant of Edom] the Gitti [belonging to Gat (winepress)].
2 Samuel,6,11,"And the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) continued in the house of ‘Oved-Edom [servant of Edom] the Gitti [belonging to Gat (winepress)] three months: and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) ‘Oved-Edom [servant of Edom] , and all his household."
2 Samuel,6,12,"And it was told king David [beloved] , saying, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) the house of ‘Oved-Edom [servant of Edom] , and all that [pertains] unto him, because of the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] . So David [beloved] went and brought up the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] from the house of ‘Oved-Edom [servant of Edom] into the city of David [beloved] with gladness."
2 Samuel,6,13,"And it was [so] , that when they that bore the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings."
2 Samuel,6,14,And David [beloved] danced before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) with all [his] might; and David [beloved] [was] girded with a linen ephod (vest).
2 Samuel,6,15,"So David [beloved] and all the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] brought up the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet."
2 Samuel,6,16,"And as the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came into the city of David [beloved] , Mikhal [who is like God?] Sha’ul’s [desired] daughter looked through a window, and saw king David [beloved] leaping and dancing before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and she despised him in her heart."
2 Samuel,6,17,"And they brought in the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David [beloved] had pitched for it: and David [beloved] offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Samuel,6,18,"And as soon as David [beloved] had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) the people in the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
2 Samuel,6,19,"And he dealt among all the people, [even] among the whole multitude of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , as well to the women as men, to everyone a cake of bread, and a good piece [of flesh] , and raisin cakes. So all the people departed everyone to his house."
2 Samuel,6,20,"Then David [beloved] returned to bless his household. And Mikhal [who is like God?] the daughter of Sha’ul [desired] came out to meet David [beloved] , and said, How glorious was the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!"
2 Samuel,6,21,"And David [beloved] said unto Mikhal [who is like God?], [It was] before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which chose me before you i father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : therefore will I play before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Samuel,6,22,"And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in my own sight: and of the maidservants which you i have spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour."
2 Samuel,6,23,Therefore Mikhal [who is like God?] the daughter of Sha’ul [desired] had no child unto the day of her death.
2 Samuel,7,1,"And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had given him rest round about from all his enemies;"
2 Samuel,7,2,"That the king said unto Natan [giver] the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] dwells within curtains."
2 Samuel,7,3,"And Natan [giver] said to the king, Go, do all that [is] in you i heart; for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] with you i."
2 Samuel,7,4,"And it came to pass that night, that the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto Natan [giver] , saying,"
2 Samuel,7,5,"Go and tell my servant David [beloved] , Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Shalt you i build me an house for me to dwell in?"
2 Samuel,7,6,"Whereas I have not dwelt in [any] house since the time that I brought up the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle."
2 Samuel,7,7,"In all [the places] wherein I have walked with all the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , whom I commanded to feed my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, Why build you 2f not me an house of cedar?"
2 Samuel,7,8,"Now therefore so shall you i say unto my servant David [beloved] , Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , I took you i from the stable, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]:"
2 Samuel,7,9,"And I was with you i to wherever you i went, and have cut off all your i enemies out of you i sight, and have made you i a great name, like unto the name of the great [men] that [are] in the earth."
2 Samuel,7,10,"Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them anymore, as formerly,"
2 Samuel,7,11,"And as since the time that I commanded [to be] over my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and have caused you i to rest from all your i enemies. Also the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) tells you i that he will make you i an house."
2 Samuel,7,12,"And when you i days be fulfilled, and you i shall sleep with you i fathers, I will set up you i seed after you i , which shall proceed out of you i bowels (inward parts; affections) , and I will establish his kingdom."
2 Samuel,7,13,"He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever."
2 Samuel,7,14,"I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:"
2 Samuel,7,15,"But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took [it] from Sha’ul [desired] , whom I put away before you i."
2 Samuel,7,16,And you i house and you i kingdom shall be established forever before you i : your i throne shall be established forever.
2 Samuel,7,17,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Natan [giver] speak unto David [beloved]."
2 Samuel,7,18,"Then went king David [beloved] in, and sat before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and he said, Who [am] I, O Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ? and what [is] my house, that you i have brought me up to this time?"
2 Samuel,7,19,"And this was yet a small thing in you i sight, O Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; but you i have spoken also of your i servant’s house for a great while to come. And [is] this the manner of man, O Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)?"
2 Samuel,7,20,"And what can David [beloved] say more unto you i ? for you i , Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , know your i servant."
2 Samuel,7,21,"For your i word’s sake, and according to your i own heart, have you i done all these great things, to make your i servant know [them]."
2 Samuel,7,22,"For what reason you i are great, O Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) : for [there is] none like you i , neither [is there any] God-Elōhīm beside you i , according to all that we have heard with our ears."
2 Samuel,7,23,"And what one nation in the earth [is] like your i people, [even] like Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , whom God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for your i land, before your i people, which you i redeem to you i from Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place], [from] the nations and their gods?"
2 Samuel,7,24,"For you i have confirmed to yourself your i people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [to be] a people unto you i forever: and you i , Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , are become their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
2 Samuel,7,25,"And now, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , the word that you i have spoken concerning your i servant, and concerning his house, establish [it] forever, and do as you i have said."
2 Samuel,7,26,"And let your i name be magnified forever, saying, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] [is] the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and let the house of your i servant David [beloved] be established before you i."
2 Samuel,7,27,"For you i , O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , have revealed to your i servant, saying, I will build you i an house: therefore has your i servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto you i."
2 Samuel,7,28,"And now, O Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , you i [are] that God-Elōhīm and your i words be true, and you i have promised this goodness unto your i servant:"
2 Samuel,7,29,"Therefore now let it please you i to bless the house of your i servant, that it may continue forever before you i : for you i , O Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , have spoken [it] : and with your i blessing let the house of your i servant be Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) forever."
2 Samuel,8,1,"And after this it came to pass, that David [beloved] struck the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and subdued them: and David [beloved] took Meteg-Amah [mother city] out of the hand of the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."
2 Samuel,8,2,"And he struck Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And [so] the Mo’avi [of his father] became David’s [beloved] ’s servants, [and] brought gifts."
2 Samuel,8,3,"David [beloved] struck also Hadad’ezer [mighty’meaning disputed] , the son of Rechov [Broad Place] , king of Tzovah [station] , as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates (to break forth, to gush)."
2 Samuel,8,4,"And David [beloved] took from him a thousand [chariots] , and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David [beloved] hamstringed all the chariot [horses] , but reserved of them [for] an hundred chariots."
2 Samuel,8,5,"And when the Aram [Syrians] of Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] came to aid Hadad’ezer [mighty - meaning disputed] king of Tzovah [station] , David [beloved] killed of the Aram [Syrians] two and twenty thousand men."
2 Samuel,8,6,"Then David [beloved] put garrisons in Aram (Syria) [exalted] f Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] : and the Aram [Syrians] became servants to David [beloved], [and] brought gifts. And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) preserved David [beloved] to wherever he went."
2 Samuel,8,7,"And David [beloved] took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadad’ezer [mighty - meaning disputed] , and brought them to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Samuel,8,8,"And from Betach [security] , and from Berotai [cypress grove] , cities of Hadad’ezer [mighty - meaning disputed] , king David [beloved] took exceeding much brass."
2 Samuel,8,9,"When To’i [wander] king of Hamat [Fortress] heard that David [beloved] had smitten all the host of Hadad’ezer [mighty - meaning disputed],"
2 Samuel,8,10,"Then To’i [wander] sent Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] his son unto king David [beloved] , to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadad’ezer [mighty - meaning disputed] , and smitten him: for Hadad’ezer [mighty - meaning disputed] had wars with To’i [wander] . And [Yoram [Yehovah is exalted]] brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:"
2 Samuel,8,11,"Which also king David [beloved] did dedicate unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;"
2 Samuel,8,12,"Of Aram (Syria) [exalted] , and of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , and of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , and of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and of ‘Amalek [Dweller in a Valley] , and of the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) of Hadad’ezer [mighty - meaning disputed] , son of Rechov [Broad Place] , king of Tzovah [station]."
2 Samuel,8,13,"And David [beloved] got [him] a name when he returned from attacking of the Aram [Syrians] in the valley of salt, [being] eighteen thousand [men]."
2 Samuel,8,14,"And he put garrisons in Edom [Red] ; throughout all Edom [Red] put he garrisons, and all they of Edom [Red] became David’s [beloved] ’s servants. And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) preserved David [beloved] to wherever he went."
2 Samuel,8,15,And David [beloved] reigned over all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and David [beloved] executed judgment and justice unto all his people.
2 Samuel,8,16,And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] the son of Tz’ruyah [balsam] [was] over the host; and Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] the son of Achilud [child’s brother] [was] recorder;
2 Samuel,8,17,"And Tzadok [righteous] the son of Achituv [my brother is good] , and Achi-Melekh [my brother is king] the son of Avyatar [my father is great], [were] the priests; and S’rayah [Yehovah is ruler] [was] the scribe;"
2 Samuel,8,18,And B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] [was over] both the K’reti [executioners] and the P’leti [couriers] ; and David’s [beloved] ’s sons were chief rulers.
2 Samuel,9,1,"And David [beloved] said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Sha’ul [desired] , that I may show him kindness for Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] ’s sake?"
2 Samuel,9,2,"And [there was] of the house of Sha’ul [desired] a servant whose name [was] Tziva [statue] . And when they had called him unto David [beloved] , the king said unto him, [Are] you i Tziva [statue] ? And he said, Your 1s servant [is he]."
2 Samuel,9,3,"And the king said, [Is] there not yet any of the house of Sha’ul [desired] , that I may show the kindness of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] unto him? And Tziva [statue] said unto the king, Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] has yet a son, [which is] lame on [his] feet."
2 Samuel,9,4,"And the king said unto him, Where [is] he? And Tziva [statue] said unto the king, Behold, he [is] in the house of Makhir [Sold] , the son of ‘Ammi’el [my kinsman is God] [My Kinsman is God] , in Lo-D’var [not a pasture]."
2 Samuel,9,5,"Then king David [beloved] sent, and fetched him out of the house of Makhir [Sold] , the son of ‘Ammi’el [my kinsman is God] [My Kinsman is God] , from Lo-D’var [not a pasture]."
2 Samuel,9,6,"Now when M’fivoshet [exterminating the idol] , the son of Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] , the son of Sha’ul [desired] , was come unto David [beloved] , he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David [beloved] said, M’fivoshet [exterminating the idol] . And he answered, Behold you i servant!"
2 Samuel,9,7,"And David [beloved] said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely show you i kindness for Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] your i father’s sake, and will restore you i all the land of Sha’ul [desired] your i father; and you i shall eat bread at my table continually."
2 Samuel,9,8,"And he bowed himself, and said, What [is] your i servant, that you i should look upon such a dead dog as I [am]?"
2 Samuel,9,9,"Then the king called to Tziva [statue] , Sha’ul’s [desired] servant, and said unto him, I have given unto your i master’s son all that pertained to Sha’ul [desired] and to all his house."
2 Samuel,9,10,"you i therefore, and your i sons, and your i servants, shall till the land for him, and you i shall bring in [the fruits] , that your i master’s son may have food to eat: but M’fivoshet [exterminating the idol] your i master’s son shall eat bread always at my table. Now Tziva [statue] had fifteen sons and twenty servants."
2 Samuel,9,11,"Then said Tziva [statue] unto the king, According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant, so shall your i servant do. As for M’fivoshet [exterminating the idol], [said the king] , he shall eat at my table, as one of the king’s sons."
2 Samuel,9,12,"And M’fivoshet [exterminating the idol] had a young son, whose name [was] Mikha [who is like God?] . And all that dwelt in the house of Tziva [statue] [were] servants unto M’fivoshet [exterminating the idol]."
2 Samuel,9,13,So M’fivoshet [exterminating the idol] dwelt in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : for he did eat continually at the king’s table; and was lame on both his feet.
2 Samuel,10,1,"And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] died, and Hanun [gracious] his son reigned in his stead."
2 Samuel,10,2,"Then said David [beloved] , I will show kindness unto Hanun [gracious] the son of Nachash [serpent] , as his father showed kindness unto me. And David [beloved] sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David’s [beloved] ’s servants came into the land of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred]."
2 Samuel,10,3,"And the princes of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] said unto Hanun [gracious] their lord, Think you i that David [beloved] does honour your i father, that he has sent comforters unto you i ? has not David [beloved] [rather] sent his servants unto you i , to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?"
2 Samuel,10,4,"For what reason Hanun [gracious] took David’s [beloved] ’s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, [even] to their buttocks, and sent them away."
2 Samuel,10,5,"When they told [it] unto David [beloved] , he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Yericho [Its Moon] until your beards be grown, and [then] return."
2 Samuel,10,6,"And when the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] saw that they stank before David [beloved] , the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] sent and hired the children of Aram [Syrians] of Beit-Rechov [House of the Street] , and the Aram [Syrians] of Tzovah [station] , twenty thousand footmen, and of king Ma’akhah [oppression] [oppression] a thousand men, and of Ish-Tov [man of goodness] twelve thousand men."
2 Samuel,10,7,"And when David [beloved] heard of [it] , he sent Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , and all the host of the mighty men."
2 Samuel,10,8,"And the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] came out, and put the battle in array (to put on; to clothe) at the entering in of the gate: and the Aram [Syrians] of Tzovah [station] , and of Rechov [Broad Place] , and Ish-Tov [man of goodness] , and Ma’akhah [oppression] [oppression], [were] by themselves in the field."
2 Samuel,10,9,"When Yo’av [Yehovah is father] saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice [men] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and put [them] in array (to put on; to clothe) against the Aram [Syrians]:"
2 Samuel,10,10,"And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Avishai [my father is a gift] his brother, that he might put [them] in array (to put on; to clothe) against the children of ‘Amon [Inbred]."
2 Samuel,10,11,"And he said, If the Aram [Syrians] be too strong for me, then you i shall help me: but if the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] be too strong for you i , then I will come and help you i."
2 Samuel,10,12,"Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) do that which seems him good."
2 Samuel,10,13,"And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] drew near, and the people that [were] with him, unto the battle against the Aram [Syrians] : and they fled before him."
2 Samuel,10,14,"And when the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] saw that the Aram [Syrians] were fled, then fled they also before Avishai [my father is a gift] , and entered into the city. So Yo’av [Yehovah is father] returned from the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , and came to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Samuel,10,15,"And when the Aram [Syrians] saw that they were smitten before Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , they gathered themselves together."
2 Samuel,10,16,"And Hadad’ezer [mighty - meaning disputed] is help sent, and brought out the Aram [Syrians] that [were] beyond the river: and they came to Heilam [stronghold] ; and Shovakh [expansion] the captain of the host of Hadad’ezer [mighty - meaning disputed] is help [went] before them."
2 Samuel,10,17,"And when it was told David [beloved] , he gathered all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] together, and passed over Yarden [Descender] , and came to Heilam [stronghold] . And the Aram [Syrians] set themselves in array (to put on; to clothe) against David [beloved] , and fought with him."
2 Samuel,10,18,"And the Aram [Syrians] fled before Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and David [beloved] killed [the men of] seven hundred chariots of the Aram [Syrians] , and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shovakh [expansion] the captain of their host, who died there."
2 Samuel,10,19,"And when all the kings [that were] servants to Hadad’ezer [mighty - meaning disputed] is help saw that they were smitten before Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , they made peace with Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and served them. So the Aram [Syrians] feared to help the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] any more."
2 Samuel,11,1,"And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth [to battle] , that David [beloved] sent Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , and his servants with him, and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and they destroyed the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , and besieged Rabbah [Great] . But David [beloved] tarried still at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Samuel,11,2,"And it came to pass in an evening, that David [beloved] arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman [was] very beautiful to look upon."
2 Samuel,11,3,"And David [beloved] sent and enquired after the woman. And [one] said, [Is] not this Bat-Sheva [daughter of an oath] , the daughter of Eli’am [God of the people, or God is kinsman] , the wife of Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] the Hitti [Terrorists]?"
2 Samuel,11,4,"And David [beloved] sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house."
2 Samuel,11,5,"And the woman conceived, and sent and told David [beloved] , and said, I [am] with child."
2 Samuel,11,6,"And David [beloved] sent to Yo’av [Yehovah is father], [saying] , Send me Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] the Hitti [Terrorists] . And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] sent Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] to David [beloved]."
2 Samuel,11,7,"And when Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] was come unto him, David [beloved] demanded [of him] how Yo’av [Yehovah is father] did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered."
2 Samuel,11,8,"And David [beloved] said to Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] , Go down to you i house, and wash you i feet. And Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a mess [of meat] from the king."
2 Samuel,11,9,"But Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house."
2 Samuel,11,10,"And when they had told David [beloved] , saying, Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] went not down unto his house, David [beloved] said unto Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] , came you i not from [your i ] journey? why [then] did you i not go down unto your i house?"
2 Samuel,11,11,"And Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] said unto David [beloved] , The ark, and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , abide in tents; and my lord Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? [as] you i live, and [as] your i soul lives, I will not do this thing."
2 Samuel,11,12,"And David [beloved] said to Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] , Tarry here today also, and tomorrow I will let you i depart. So Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] abode in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] that day, and the morrow."
2 Samuel,11,13,"And when David [beloved] had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house."
2 Samuel,11,14,"And it came to pass in the morning, that David [beloved] wrote a letter to Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , and sent [it] by the hand of Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)]."
2 Samuel,11,15,"And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set you 2f Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire you 2f from him, that he may be smitten, and die."
2 Samuel,11,16,"And it came to pass, when Yo’av [Yehovah is father] observed the city, that he assigned Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] unto a place where he knew that valiant men [were]."
2 Samuel,11,17,"And the men of the city went out, and fought with Yo’av [Yehovah is father] : and there fell [some] of the people of the servants of David [beloved] ; and Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] the Hitti [Terrorists] died also."
2 Samuel,11,18,Then Yo’av [Yehovah is father] sent and told David [beloved] all the things concerning the war;
2 Samuel,11,19,"And charged the messenger, saying, When you i have made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,"
2 Samuel,11,20,"And if so be that the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto you i , For what reason approached you 2f so near unto the city when you 2f did fight? knew you 2f not that they would shoot from the wall?"
2 Samuel,11,21,"Who struck Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] the son of Yerubeshet [shame will contend] ? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Tevetz [Conspicuous] ? why went you 2f near the wall? then say you i , Your 1s servant Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] the Hitti [Terrorists] is dead also."
2 Samuel,11,22,"So the messenger went, and came and showed David [beloved] all that Yo’av [Yehovah is father] had sent him for."
2 Samuel,11,23,"And the messenger said unto David [beloved] , Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate."
2 Samuel,11,24,"And the shooters shot from off the wall upon your i servants; and [some] of the king’s servants be dead, and your i servant Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] the Hitti [Terrorists] is dead also."
2 Samuel,11,25,"Then David [beloved] said unto the messenger, Thus shall you i say unto Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , Let not this thing displease you i , for the sword devours one as well as another: make your i battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage you i him."
2 Samuel,11,26,"And when the wife of Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] heard that Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband."
2 Samuel,11,27,"And when the mourning was past, David [beloved] sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David [beloved] had done displeased the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Samuel,12,1,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent Natan [giver] unto David [beloved] . And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor."
2 Samuel,12,2,The rich [man] had exceeding many flocks and herds:
2 Samuel,12,3,"But the poor [man] had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter."
2 Samuel,12,4,"And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him."
2 Samuel,12,5,"And David’s [beloved] ’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Natan [giver], [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, the man that has done this [thing] shall surely die:"
2 Samuel,12,6,"And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity."
2 Samuel,12,7,"And Natan [giver] said to David [beloved] , you i [are] the man. Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , I anointed you i king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and I delivered you i out of the hand of Sha’ul [desired];"
2 Samuel,12,8,"And I gave you i your i master’s house, and your i master’s wives into your i bosom, and gave you i the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ; and if [that had been] too little, I would moreover have given unto you i such and such things."
2 Samuel,12,9,"For what reason have you i despised the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to do evil in his sight? you i have killed Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] the Hitti [Terrorists] with the sword, and have taken his wife [to be] your i wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred]."
2 Samuel,12,10,"Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your i house; because you i have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] the Hitti [Terrorists] to be your i wife."
2 Samuel,12,11,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Behold, I will raise up evil against you i out of your i own house, and I will take your i wives before you i eyes, and give [them] unto your i neighbour, and he shall lie with your i wives in the sight of this sun."
2 Samuel,12,12,"For you i did [it] secretly: but I will do this thing before all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and before the sun."
2 Samuel,12,13,"And David [beloved] said unto Natan [giver] , I have sinned against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . And Natan [giver] said unto David [beloved] , The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) also has put away your i sin; you i shall not die."
2 Samuel,12,14,"However, because by this deed you i have given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to blaspheme, the child also [that is] born unto you i shall surely die."
2 Samuel,12,15,"And Natan [giver] departed unto his house. And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) struck the child that Uriyah’s [Yehovah is my light (flame)]’s wife bore unto David [beloved] , and it was very sick."
2 Samuel,12,16,"David [beloved] therefore besought God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] for the child; and David [beloved] fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth."
2 Samuel,12,17,"And the elders of his house arose, [and went] to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them."
2 Samuel,12,18,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David [beloved] feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?"
2 Samuel,12,19,"But when David [beloved] saw that his servants whispered, David [beloved] perceived that the child was dead: therefore David [beloved] said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead."
2 Samuel,12,20,"Then David [beloved] arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed [himself] , and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat."
2 Samuel,12,21,"Then said his servants unto him, What thing [is] this that you i have done? you i did fast and weep for the child, [while it was] alive; but when the child was dead, you i did rise and eat bread."
2 Samuel,12,22,"And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell [whether] GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?"
2 Samuel,12,23,"But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me."
2 Samuel,12,24,"And David [beloved] comforted Bat-Sheva [daughter of an oath] his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bore a son, and he called his name Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] : and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) loved him."
2 Samuel,12,25,"And he sent by the hand of Natan [giver] the prophet; and he called his name Y’didyah [beloved of Yehovah] , because of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Samuel,12,26,"And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] fought against Rabbah [Great] of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , and took the royal city."
2 Samuel,12,27,"And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] sent messengers to David [beloved] , and said, I have fought against Rabbah [Great] , and have taken the city of waters."
2 Samuel,12,28,"Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name."
2 Samuel,12,29,"And David [beloved] gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah [Great] , and fought against it, and took it."
2 Samuel,12,30,"And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight whereof [was] a talent (weight of money; weight; gift) of gold with the precious stones: and it was [set] on David’s [beloved] ’s head. And he brought forth the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) of the city in great abundance."
2 Samuel,12,31,"And he brought forth the people that [were] in it, and put [them] under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick factory: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] . So David [beloved] and all the people returned unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Samuel,13,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Avshalom [my father is peace] the son of David [beloved] had a fair sister, whose name [was] Tamar [palm-tree] ; and Amnon [faithful] the son of David [beloved] loved her."
2 Samuel,13,2,"And Amnon [faithful] was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar [palm-tree] ; for she [was] a virgin; and Amnon [faithful] thought it hard for him to do anything to her."
2 Samuel,13,3,"But Amnon [faithful] had a friend, whose name [was] Yonadav [Yehovah is willing] [Generous] , the son of Shim’ah [report] David’s [beloved] ’s brother: and Yonadav [Yehovah is willing] [Generous] [was] a very subtle man."
2 Samuel,13,4,"And he said unto him, Why [are] you i, [being] the king’s son, lean from day to day? will you i not tell me? And Amnon [faithful] said unto him, I love Tamar [palm-tree] , my brother Avshalom [my father is peace] ’s sister."
2 Samuel,13,5,"And Yonadav [Yehovah is willing] [Generous] said unto him, Lay you i down on your i bed, and make yourself sick: and when your i father comes to see you i , say unto him, I pray you i , let my sister Tamar [palm-tree] come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see [it] , and eat [it] at her hand."
2 Samuel,13,6,"So Amnon [faithful] lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon [faithful] said unto the king, I pray you i , let Tamar [palm-tree] my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand."
2 Samuel,13,7,"Then David [beloved] sent home to Tamar [palm-tree] , saying, Go now to your i brother Amnon [faithful] ’s house, and dress him meat."
2 Samuel,13,8,"So Tamar [palm-tree] went to her brother Amnon [faithful] ’s house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded [it] , and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes."
2 Samuel,13,9,"And she took a pan, and poured [them] out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon [faithful] said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him."
2 Samuel,13,10,"And Amnon [faithful] said unto Tamar [palm-tree] , Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of you i hand. And Tamar [palm-tree] took the cakes which she had made, and brought [them] into the chamber to Amnon [faithful] her brother."
2 Samuel,13,11,"And when she had brought [them] unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister."
2 Samuel,13,12,"And she answered him, No, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : do not you i this folly."
2 Samuel,13,13,"And I, to which shall I cause my shame to go? and as for you i , you i shall be as one of the fools in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] . Now therefore, I pray you i , speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from you i."
2 Samuel,13,14,"However he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her."
2 Samuel,13,15,"Then Amnon [faithful] hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred which he hated her [was] greater than the love which he had loved her. And Amnon [faithful] said unto her, Arise, be gone."
2 Samuel,13,16,"And she said unto him, [There is] no cause: this evil in sending me away [is] greater than the other that you i did unto me. But he would not hearken unto her."
2 Samuel,13,17,"Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this [woman] out from me, and bolt the door after her."
2 Samuel,13,18,"And [she had] a garment of diverse colours upon her: for with such robes were the king’s daughters [that were] virgins appareled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her."
2 Samuel,13,19,"And Tamar [palm-tree] put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of diverse colours that [was] on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying."
2 Samuel,13,20,"And Avshalom [my father is peace] her brother said unto her, Has Amnon [faithful] you i brother been with you i ? but hold now you i peace, my sister: he [is] your i brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar [palm-tree] remained desolate in her brother Avshalom [my father is peace] ’s house."
2 Samuel,13,21,"But when king David [beloved] heard of all these things, he was very exceedingly angry."
2 Samuel,13,22,"And Avshalom [my father is peace] spoke unto his brother Amnon [faithful] neither good nor bad: for Avshalom [my father is peace] hated Amnon [faithful] , because he had forced his sister Tamar [palm-tree]."
2 Samuel,13,23,"And it came to pass after two full years, that Avshalom [my father is peace] had sheepshearers in Ba’al-Hatzor [lord of the village] , which [is] beside Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] : and Avshalom [my father is peace] invited all the king’s sons."
2 Samuel,13,24,"And Avshalom [my father is peace] came to the king, and said, Behold now, your i servant has sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , and his servants go with you i servant."
2 Samuel,13,25,"And the king said to Avshalom [my father is peace] , No, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto you i . And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) him."
2 Samuel,13,26,"Then said Avshalom [my father is peace] , If not, I pray you i , let my brother Amnon [faithful] go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with you i?"
2 Samuel,13,27,"But Avshalom [my father is peace] pressed him, that he let Amnon [faithful] and all the king’s sons go with him."
2 Samuel,13,28,"Now Avshalom [my father is peace] had commanded his servants, saying, Mark you 2f now when Amnon [faithful] ’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Strike Amnon [faithful] ; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant."
2 Samuel,13,29,"And the servants of Avshalom [my father is peace] did unto Amnon [faithful] as Avshalom [my father is peace] had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man got him up upon his mule, and fled."
2 Samuel,13,30,"And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David [beloved] , saying, Avshalom [my father is peace] has slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left."
2 Samuel,13,31,"Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent."
2 Samuel,13,32,"And Yonadav [Yehovah is willing] [Generous] , the son of Shim’ah [report] David’s [beloved] ’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose [that] they have slain all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon [faithful] only is dead: for by the appointment of Avshalom [my father is peace] this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar [palm-tree]."
2 Samuel,13,33,"Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead: for Amnon [faithful] only is dead."
2 Samuel,13,34,"But Avshalom [my father is peace] fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him."
2 Samuel,13,35,"And Yonadav [Yehovah is willing] [Generous] said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as your i servant said, so it is."
2 Samuel,13,36,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore."
2 Samuel,13,37,"But Avshalom [my father is peace] fled, and went to Talmai [Plowman] , the son of Ammihud [People of Majesty] , king of G’shur [proud beholder] . And [David [beloved] ] mourned for his son every day."
2 Samuel,13,38,"So Avshalom [my father is peace] fled, and went to G’shur [proud beholder] , and was there three years."
2 Samuel,13,39,"And [the soul of] king David [beloved] longed to go forth unto Avshalom [my father is peace] : for he was comforted concerning Amnon [faithful] , seeing he was dead."
2 Samuel,14,1,Now Yo’av [Yehovah is father] the son of Tz’ruyah [balsam] perceived that the king’s heart [was] toward Avshalom [my father is peace].
2 Samuel,14,2,"And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] sent to T’koa [trumpet blast] , and fetched there a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray you i , feign (to pretend to be; to disguise) yourself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not yourself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:"
2 Samuel,14,3,"And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Yo’av [Yehovah is father] put the words in her mouth."
2 Samuel,14,4,"And when the woman of T’koa [trumpet blast] spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obesiance (bowing or kneeling in respect) , and said, Help, O king."
2 Samuel,14,5,"And the king said unto her, What ails you i ? And she answered, I [am] indeed a widow woman, and my husband is dead."
2 Samuel,14,6,"And your i female servant had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and [there was] none to part them, but the one struck the other, and killed him."
2 Samuel,14,7,"And, behold, the whole family is risen against your i female servant, and they said, Deliver him that struck his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he killed; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband [neither] name nor remainder upon the earth."
2 Samuel,14,8,"And the king said unto the woman, Go to your i house, and I will give charge concerning you i."
2 Samuel,14,9,"And the woman of T’koa [trumpet blast] said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity [be] on me, and on my father’s house: and the king and his throne [be] guiltless."
2 Samuel,14,10,"And the king said, Whosoever says [ought] unto you i , bring him to me, and he shall not touch you i anymore."
2 Samuel,14,11,"Then said she, I pray you i , let the king remember the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , that you i would not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, there shall not one hair of your i son fall to (to do entirely, do wholly) the earth."
2 Samuel,14,12,"Then the woman said, Let your i female servant, I pray you i , speak [one] word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on."
2 Samuel,14,13,"And the woman said, For what reason then have you i thought such a thing against the people of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ? for the king does speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king does not fetch home again his banished."
2 Samuel,14,14,"For we must needs die, and [are] as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither does God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] respect [any] person: yet does he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him."
2 Samuel,14,15,"Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, [it is] because the people have made me afraid: and you i female servant said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his female servant."
2 Samuel,14,16,"For the king will hear, to deliver his female servant out of the hand of the man [that would] destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
2 Samuel,14,17,"Then your i female servant said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , so [is] my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] will be with you i."
2 Samuel,14,18,"Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray you i , the thing that I shall ask you i . And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak."
2 Samuel,14,19,"And the king said, [Is not] the hand of Yo’av [Yehovah is father] with you i in all this? And the woman answered and said, [As] your i soul lives, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king has spoken: for your i servant Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your i female servant:"
2 Samuel,14,20,"To fetch about this form of speech has your i servant Yo’av [Yehovah is father] done this thing: and my lord [is] wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , to know all [things] that [are] in the earth."
2 Samuel,14,21,"And the king said unto Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Avshalom [my father is peace] again."
2 Samuel,14,22,"And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Yo’av [Yehovah is father] said, To day your i servant knows that I have found grace in your i sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has fulfilled the request of his servant."
2 Samuel,14,23,"So Yo’av [Yehovah is father] arose and went to G’shur [proud beholder] , and brought Avshalom [my father is peace] to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Samuel,14,24,"And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Avshalom [my father is peace] returned to his own house, and saw not the king’s face."
2 Samuel,14,25,But in all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] there was none to be so much praised as Avshalom [my father is peace] for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
2 Samuel,14,26,"And when he cut hair from his head, (for it was at every year’s end that he polled [it] : because [the hair] was heavy on him, therefore he polled it) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king’s weight."
2 Samuel,14,27,"And unto Avshalom [my father is peace] there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name [was] Tamar [palm-tree] : she was a woman of a fair Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor)."
2 Samuel,14,28,"So Avshalom [my father is peace] dwelt two full years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and saw not the king’s face."
2 Samuel,14,29,"Therefore Avshalom [my father is peace] sent for Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come."
2 Samuel,14,30,"Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Yo’av [Yehovah is father] ’s field is near my, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. And Avshalom [my father is peace] ’s servants set the field on fire."
2 Samuel,14,31,"Then Yo’av [Yehovah is father] arose, and came to Avshalom [my father is peace] unto [his] house, and said unto him, For what reason have you i servants set my field on fire?"
2 Samuel,14,32,"And Avshalom [my father is peace] answered Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , Behold, I sent unto you i , saying, Come here, that I may send you i to the king, to say, For what reason am I come from G’shur [proud beholder]? [it had been] good for me [to have been] there still: now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be [any] iniquity in me, let him kill me."
2 Samuel,14,33,"So Yo’av [Yehovah is father] came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Avshalom [my father is peace] , he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Avshalom [my father is peace]."
2 Samuel,15,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Avshalom [my father is peace] prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him."
2 Samuel,15,2,"And Avshalom [my father is peace] rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was [so] , that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Avshalom [my father is peace] called unto him, and said, Of what city [are] you i ? And he said, You 1s servant [is] of one of the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Samuel,15,3,"And Avshalom [my father is peace] said unto him, See, you i matters [are] good and right; but [there is] no man [deputed] of the king to hear you i."
2 Samuel,15,4,"Avshalom [my father is peace] said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which has any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!"
2 Samuel,15,5,"And it was [so] , that when any man came near [to him] to do him obesiance (bowing or kneeling in respect) , he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him."
2 Samuel,15,6,And on this manner did Avshalom [my father is peace] to all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that came to the king for judgment: so Avshalom [my father is peace] stole the hearts of the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
2 Samuel,15,7,"And it came to pass after forty years, that Avshalom [my father is peace] said unto the king, I pray you i , let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , in Hevron [Seat of Association]."
2 Samuel,15,8,"For you i servant vowed a vow while I abode at G’shur [proud beholder] in Aram (Syria) [exalted] , saying, If the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall bring me again indeed to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , then I will serve the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Samuel,15,9,"And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hevron [Seat of Association]."
2 Samuel,15,10,"But Avshalom [my father is peace] sent spies throughout all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, As soon as you 2f hear the sound of the trumpet, then you 2f shall say, Avshalom [my father is peace] reigns in Hevron [Seat of Association]."
2 Samuel,15,11,"And with Avshalom [my father is peace] went two hundred men out of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace], [that were] called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not anything."
2 Samuel,15,12,"And Avshalom [my father is peace] sent for Achitofel [my brother i foolish] the Giloni [gentilic of preceding] , David’s [beloved] ’s counselor, from his city, [even] from Giloh [Exile] , while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Avshalom [my father is peace]."
2 Samuel,15,13,"And there came a messenger to David [beloved] , saying, The hearts of the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] are after Avshalom [my father is peace]."
2 Samuel,15,14,"And David [beloved] said unto all his servants that [were] with him at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not [else] escape from Avshalom [my father is peace] : make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword."
2 Samuel,15,15,"And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, your i servants [are ready to do] whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint."
2 Samuel,15,16,"And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, [which were] concubines, to keep the house."
2 Samuel,15,17,"And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off."
2 Samuel,15,18,"And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the K’reti [executioners] , and all the P’leti [couriers] , and all the Gittim [belonging to the winepress] , six hundred men which came after him from Gat [Winepress] , passed on before the king."
2 Samuel,15,19,"Then said the king to Ittai [with me] the Gitti [belonging to Gat (winepress)] , For what reason go you i also with us? return to your i place, and abide with the king: for you i [are] a stranger, and also an exile."
2 Samuel,15,20,"Whereas you i came [but] yesterday, should I this day make you i go up and down with us? seeing I go to which I may, return you i , and take back your i brethren: mercy and truth [be] with you i."
2 Samuel,15,21,"And Ittai [with me] answered the king, and said, [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, and [as] my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will your i servant be."
2 Samuel,15,22,"And David [beloved] said to Ittai [with me] , Go and pass over. And Ittai [with me] the Gitti [belonging to Gat (winepress)] passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that [were] with him."
2 Samuel,15,23,"And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron [dark] , and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness."
2 Samuel,15,24,"And lo Tzadok [righteous] also, and all the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] [were] with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : and they set down the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; and Avyatar [my father is great] went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city."
2 Samuel,15,25,"And the king said unto Tzadok [righteous] , Carry back the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , he will bring me again, and show me [both] it, and his habitation:"
2 Samuel,15,26,"But if he thus say, I have no delight in you i ; behold, [here am] I, let him do to me as seems good unto him."
2 Samuel,15,27,"The king said also unto Tzadok [righteous] the priest, [Are not] you i a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Achima’atz [my brother is anger (wrath)] you i son, and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] the son of Avyatar [my father is great]."
2 Samuel,15,28,"See, I will wait in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me."
2 Samuel,15,29,Tzadok [righteous] therefore and Avyatar [my father is great] carried the ark of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] again to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : and they tarried there.
2 Samuel,15,30,"And David [beloved] went up by the ascent of [mount of] Olives, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that [was] with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up."
2 Samuel,15,31,"And [one] told David [beloved] , saying, Achitofel [my brother i foolish] [is] among the conspirators with Avshalom [my father is peace] . And David [beloved] said, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , I pray you i , turn the counsel of Achitofel [my brother i foolish] into foolishness."
2 Samuel,15,32,"And it came to pass, that [when] David [beloved] was come to the top [of the mount] , where he worshipped God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , behold, Hushai [hasting] the Arki [lengthy] came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:"
2 Samuel,15,33,"Unto whom David [beloved] said, If you i pass on with me, then you i shall be a burden unto me:"
2 Samuel,15,34,"But if you i return to the city, and say unto Avshalom [my father is peace] , I will be your i servant, O king; [as] I [have been] your i father’s servant up to this time, so [will] I now also [be] your i servant: then may you i for me defeat the counsel of Achitofel [my brother i foolish]."
2 Samuel,15,35,"And [have you i ] not there with you i Tzadok [righteous] and Avyatar [my father is great] the priests? therefore it shall be, [that] what thing soever you i shall hear out of the king’s house, you i shall tell [it] to Tzadok [righteous] and Avyatar [my father is great] the priests."
2 Samuel,15,36,"Behold, [they have] there with them their two sons, Achima’atz [my brother is anger (wrath)] Tzadok [righteous] ’s [son] , and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] Avyatar [my father is great] ’s [son] ; and by them you 2f shall send unto me every thing that you 2f can hear."
2 Samuel,15,37,"So Hushai [hasting] David’s [beloved] ’s friend came into the city, and Avshalom [my father is peace] came into Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Samuel,16,1,"And when David [beloved] was a little past the top [of the hill] , behold, Tziva [statue] the servant of M’fivoshet [exterminating the idol] met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred [loaves] of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine."
2 Samuel,16,2,"And the king said unto Tziva [statue] , What mean you i by these? And Tziva [statue] said, The asses [be] for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink."
2 Samuel,16,3,"And the king said, And where [is] your i master’s son? And Tziva [statue] said unto the king, Behold, he abides at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : for he said, To day shall the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] restore me the kingdom of my father."
2 Samuel,16,4,"Then said the king to Tziva [statue] , Behold, you i [are] all that [pertained] unto M’fivoshet [exterminating the idol] . And Tziva [statue] said, I humbly beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i [that] I may find grace in you i sight, my lord, O king."
2 Samuel,16,5,"And when king David [beloved] came to Bachurim [young men’s village] , behold, there came out a man of the family of the house of Sha’ul [desired] , whose name [was] Shime’i [Fame] , the son of Gera [A Grain] : he came forth, and cursed still as he came."
2 Samuel,16,6,"And he cast stones at David [beloved] , and at all the servants of king David [beloved] : and all the people and all the mighty men [were] on his right hand and on his left."
2 Samuel,16,7,"And thus said Shime’i [Fame] when he cursed, Come out, come out, you i bloody man, and you i man of Belial [Worthless, Good for Nothing]:"
2 Samuel,16,8,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has returned upon you i all the blood of the house of Sha’ul [desired] , in whose stead you i have reigned; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Avshalom [my father is peace] you i son: and, behold, you i [are taken] in you i mischief, because you i [are] a bloody man."
2 Samuel,16,9,"Then said Avishai [my father is a gift] the son of Tz’ruyah [balsam] unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray you i , and take off his head."
2 Samuel,16,10,"And the king said, What have I to do with you, you 2f sons of Tz’ruyah [balsam] ? so let him curse, because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has said unto him, Curse David [beloved] . Who shall then say, For what reason have you i done so?"
2 Samuel,16,11,"And David [beloved] said to Avishai [my father is a gift] , and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels (inward parts; affections) , seeks my life: how much more now [may this] Benyamini [son of the right hand] [do it] ? let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has bidden him."
2 Samuel,16,12,"It may be that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will look on my affliction, and that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will requite (repay) me good for his cursing this day."
2 Samuel,16,13,"And as David [beloved] and his men went by the way, Shime’i [Fame] went along on the hill’s side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust."
2 Samuel,16,14,"And the king, and all the people that [were] with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there."
2 Samuel,16,15,"And Avshalom [my father is peace] , and all the people the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , came to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and Achitofel [my brother i foolish] with him."
2 Samuel,16,16,"And it came to pass, when Hushai [hasting] the Arki [lengthy] , David’s [beloved] ’s friend, was come unto Avshalom [my father is peace] , that Hushai [hasting] said unto Avshalom [my father is peace] , Long live the king! Long live the king!"
2 Samuel,16,17,"And Avshalom [my father is peace] said to Hushai [hasting], [Is] this you i kindness to you i friend? why went you i not with you i friend?"
2 Samuel,16,18,"And Hushai [hasting] said unto Avshalom [my father is peace] , No; but whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and this people, and all the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide."
2 Samuel,16,19,"And again, whom should I serve? [should I] not [serve] in the presence of his son? as I have served in you i father’s presence, so will I be in you i presence."
2 Samuel,16,20,"Then said Avshalom [my father is peace] to Achitofel [my brother i foolish] , Give counsel among you what we shall do."
2 Samuel,16,21,"And Achitofel [my brother i foolish] said unto Avshalom [my father is peace] , Go in unto you i father’s concubines, which he has left to keep the house; and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall hear that you i are abhorred of you i father: then shall the hands of all that [are] with you i be strong."
2 Samuel,16,22,So they spread Avshalom [my father is peace] a tent upon the top of the house; and Avshalom [my father is peace] went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
2 Samuel,16,23,"And the counsel of Achitofel [my brother i foolish] , which he counseled in those days, [was] as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : so [was] all the counsel of Achitofel [my brother i foolish] both with David [beloved] and with Avshalom [my father is peace]."
2 Samuel,17,1,"Moreover Achitofel [my brother i foolish] said unto Avshalom [my father is peace] , Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David [beloved] this night:"
2 Samuel,17,2,"And I will come upon him while he [is] weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that [are] with him shall flee; and I will strike the king only:"
2 Samuel,17,3,And I will bring back all the people unto you i : the man whom you i [is] as if all returned: [so] all the people shall be in peace.
2 Samuel,17,4,"And the saying pleased Avshalom [my father is peace] well, and all the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Samuel,17,5,"Then said Avshalom [my father is peace] , Call now Hushai [hasting] the Arki [lengthy] also, and let us hear likewise what he says."
2 Samuel,17,6,"And when Hushai [hasting] was come to Avshalom [my father is peace] , Avshalom [my father is peace] spoke unto him, saying, Achitofel [my brother i foolish] has spoken after this manner: shall we do [after] his saying? if not; speak you i."
2 Samuel,17,7,"And Hushai [hasting] said unto Avshalom [my father is peace] , The counsel that Achitofel [my brother i foolish] has given [is] not good at this time."
2 Samuel,17,8,"For, said Hushai [hasting] , you i know your i father and his men, that they [be] mighty men, and they [be] chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and your i father [is] a man of war, and will not lodge with the people."
2 Samuel,17,9,"Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some [other] place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Avshalom [my father is peace]."
2 Samuel,17,10,"And he also [that is] valiant, whose heart [is] as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] knows that you i father [is] a mighty man, and [they] which [be] with him [are] valiant men."
2 Samuel,17,11,"Therefore I counsel that all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] be generally gathered unto you i , from Dan [Judge] even to Be’er-sheva [Well of the sevenfold Oath] , as the sand that [is] by the sea for multitude; and that you i go to battle in your i own person."
2 Samuel,17,12,"So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falls on the ground: and of him and of all the men that [are] with him there shall not be left so much as one."
2 Samuel,17,13,"Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there."
2 Samuel,17,14,"And Avshalom [my father is peace] and all the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said, The counsel of Hushai [hasting] the Arki [lengthy] [is] better than the counsel of Achitofel [my brother i foolish] . For the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Achitofel [my brother i foolish] , to the intent that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) might bring evil upon Avshalom [my father is peace]."
2 Samuel,17,15,"Then said Hushai [hasting] unto Tzadok [righteous] and to Avyatar [my father is great] the priests, Thus and thus did Achitofel [my brother i foolish] counsel Avshalom [my father is peace] and the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and thus and thus have I counseled."
2 Samuel,17,16,"Now therefore send quickly, and tell David [beloved] , saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallow (to approve, commend, accept) ed up, and all the people that [are] with him."
2 Samuel,17,17,Now Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] and Achima’atz [my brother is anger (wrath)] detained (held) by ‘Ein-Rogel (a place near Jerusalem) [Fount of the Fuller (washer and/or bleacher of clothes)] ; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David [beloved].
2 Samuel,17,18,"Nevertheless a boy saw them, and told Avshalom [my father is peace] : but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man’s house in Bachurim [young men’s village] , which had a well in his court; to which they went down."
2 Samuel,17,19,"And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known."
2 Samuel,17,20,"And when Avshalom [my father is peace] ’s servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where [is] Achima’atz [my brother is anger (wrath)] and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] ? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find [them] , they returned to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Samuel,17,21,"And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David [beloved] , and said unto David [beloved] , Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus has Achitofel [my brother i foolish] counseled against you."
2 Samuel,17,22,"Then David [beloved] arose, and all the people that [were] with him, and they passed over Yarden [Descender] : by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Yarden [Descender]."
2 Samuel,17,23,"And when Achitofel [my brother i foolish] saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled [his] ass, and arose, and got him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulcher of his father."
2 Samuel,17,24,"Then David [beloved] came to Machanayim [Two Camps] . And Avshalom [my father is peace] passed over Yarden [Descender] , he and all the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with him."
2 Samuel,17,25,"And Avshalom [my father is peace] made ‘Amasa [burden] captain of the host instead of Yo’av [Yehovah is father] : which ‘Amasa [burden] [was] a man’s son, whose name [was] Yitra [abundance] an Israeli, that went in to Avigayil [my father is joy] the daughter of Nachash [serpent] , sister to Tz’ruyah [balsam] Yo’av [Yehovah is father] ’s mother."
2 Samuel,17,26,So Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and Avshalom [my father is peace] pitched in the land of Gil’ad [Rocky Region].
2 Samuel,17,27,"And it came to pass, when David [beloved] was come to Machanayim [Two Camps] , that Shovi [glorious] the son of Nachash [serpent] of Rabbah [Great] of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , and Makhir [Sold] the son of ‘Ammi’el [my kinsman is God] [My Kinsman is God] of Lo-D’var [not a pasture] , and Barzillai [my iron] the Gil’adi [Hill of Testimony] of Rogelim [place of fullers],"
2 Samuel,17,28,"Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched [corn] , and beans, and lentiles, and parched [pulse (peas; beans; legumes)],"
2 Samuel,17,29,"And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of cattle, for David [beloved] , and for the people that [were] with him, to eat: for they said, The people [is] hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness."
2 Samuel,18,1,"And David [beloved] numbered the people that [were] with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them."
2 Samuel,18,2,"And David [beloved] sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , and a third part under the hand of Avishai [my father is a gift] the son of Tz’ruyah [balsam] , Yo’av [Yehovah is father] ’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai [with me] the Gitti [belonging to Gat (winepress)] . And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also."
2 Samuel,18,3,"But the people answered, you i shall not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now [you i are] worth ten thousand of us: therefore now [it is] better that you i help (aid) us out of the city."
2 Samuel,18,4,"And the king said unto them, What seems you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands."
2 Samuel,18,5,"And the king commanded Yo’av [Yehovah is father] and Avishai [my father is a gift] and Ittai [with me] , saying, [Deal] gently for my sake with the young man, [even] with Avshalom [my father is peace] . And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Avshalom [my father is peace]."
2 Samuel,18,6,So the people went out into the field against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and the battle was in the wood of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful];
2 Samuel,18,7,"Where the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were slain before the servants of David [beloved] , and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand [men]."
2 Samuel,18,8,For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
2 Samuel,18,9,"And Avshalom [my father is peace] met the servants of David [beloved] . And Avshalom [my father is peace] rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that [was] under him went away."
2 Samuel,18,10,"And a certain man saw [it] , and told Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , and said, Behold, I saw Avshalom [my father is peace] hanged in an oak."
2 Samuel,18,11,"And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] said unto the man that told him, And, behold, you i saw [him] , and why did you i not strike him there to the ground? and I would have given you i ten [shekels] of silver, and a belt."
2 Samuel,18,12,"And the man said unto Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , Though I should receive a thousand [shekels] of silver in my hand, [yet] would I not put forth my hand against the king’s son: for in our hearing the king charged you i and Avishai [my father is a gift] and Ittai [with me] , saying, Beware that none [touch] the young man Avshalom [my father is peace]."
2 Samuel,18,13,"Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against my own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and you i yourself would have set yourself against [me]."
2 Samuel,18,14,"Then said Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , I may not wait thus with you i . And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Avshalom [my father is peace] , while he [was] yet alive in the midst of the oak."
2 Samuel,18,15,"And ten young men that bore Yo’av [Yehovah is father] ’s armour compassed about and struck Avshalom [my father is peace] , and killed him."
2 Samuel,18,16,"And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : for Yo’av [Yehovah is father] held back the people."
2 Samuel,18,17,"And they took Avshalom [my father is peace] , and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] fled everyone to his tent."
2 Samuel,18,18,"Now Avshalom [my father is peace] in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which [is] in the king’s dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Avshalom [my father is peace] ’s place."
2 Samuel,18,19,"Then said Achima’atz [my brother is anger (wrath)] the son of Tzadok [righteous] , Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has avenged him of his enemies."
2 Samuel,18,20,"And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] said unto him, you i shall not bear tidings this day, but you i shall bear tidings another day: but this day you i shall bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead."
2 Samuel,18,21,"Then said Yo’av [Yehovah is father] to Kushi [their blackness] , Go tell the king what you i have seen. And Kushi [their blackness] bowed himself unto Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , and ran."
2 Samuel,18,22,"Then said Achima’atz [my brother is anger (wrath)] the son of Tzadok [righteous] yet again to Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , But howsoever, let me, I pray you i , also run after Kushi [their blackness] . And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] said, For what reason will you i run, my son, seeing that you i have no tidings ready?"
2 Samuel,18,23,"But howsoever, [said he] , let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Achima’atz [my brother is anger (wrath)] ran by the way of the plain, and overran Kushi [their blackness]."
2 Samuel,18,24,"And David [beloved] sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone."
2 Samuel,18,25,"And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he [be] alone, [there is] tidings in his mouth. And he came apace (at a quick pace; quickly) , and drew near."
2 Samuel,18,26,"And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold [another] man running alone. And the king said, He also brings tidings."
2 Samuel,18,27,"And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Achima’atz [my brother is anger (wrath)] the son of Tzadok [righteous] . And the king said, He [is] a good man, and comes with good tidings."
2 Samuel,18,28,"And Achima’atz [my brother is anger (wrath)] called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which has delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king."
2 Samuel,18,29,"And the king said, Is the young man Avshalom [my father is peace] safe? And Achima’atz [my brother is anger (wrath)] answered, When Yo’av [Yehovah is father] sent the king’s servant, and [me] you i servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what [it was]."
2 Samuel,18,30,"And the king said [unto him] , Turn aside, [and] stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still."
2 Samuel,18,31,"And, behold, Kushi [their blackness] came; and Kushi [their blackness] said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has avenged you i this day of all them that rose up against you i."
2 Samuel,18,32,"And the king said unto Kushi [their blackness] , Is the young man Avshalom [my father is peace] safe? And Kushi [their blackness] answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against you i to do [you i ] hurt, be as [that] young man [is]."
2 Samuel,18,33,"And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Avshalom [my father is peace] , my son, my son Avshalom [my father is peace] ! would God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] I had died for you i , O Avshalom [my father is peace] , my son, my son!"
2 Samuel,19,1,"And it was told Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , Behold, the king weep and mourns for Avshalom [my father is peace]."
2 Samuel,19,2,And the victory that day was [turned] into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.
2 Samuel,19,3,"And the people got them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle."
2 Samuel,19,4,"But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Avshalom [my father is peace] , O Avshalom [my father is peace] , my son, my son!"
2 Samuel,19,5,"And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] came into the house to the king, and said, you i have shamed this day the faces of all you i servants, which this day have saved your i life, and the lives of your i sons and of your i daughters, and the lives of your i wives, and the lives of your i concubines;"
2 Samuel,19,6,"In that you i love your i enemies, and hate your i friends. For you i have declared this day, that you i regard neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Avshalom [my father is peace] had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased you i well."
2 Samuel,19,7,"Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto you i servants: for I swear by the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , if you i go not forth, there will not wait one with you i this night: and that will be worse unto you i than all the evil that befell you i from you i youth until now."
2 Samuel,19,8,"Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king does sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] had fled every man to his tent."
2 Samuel,19,9,"And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] ; and now he is fled out of the land for Avshalom [my father is peace]."
2 Samuel,19,10,"And Avshalom [my father is peace] , whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak you 2f not a word of bringing the king back?"
2 Samuel,19,11,"And king David [beloved] sent to Tzadok [righteous] and to Avyatar [my father is great] the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , saying, Why are you 2f the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] is come to the king, [even] to his house."
2 Samuel,19,12,"You 2f [are] my brethren, you 2f [are] my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are you 2f the last to bring back the king?"
2 Samuel,19,13,"And say you 2f to ‘Amasa [burden], [Are] you i not of my bone, and of my flesh? God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] do so to me, and more also, if you i be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Yo’av [Yehovah is father]."
2 Samuel,19,14,"And he bowed the heart of all the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , even as [the heart of] one man; so that they sent [this word] unto the king, Return you i , and all you i servants."
2 Samuel,19,15,"So the king returned, and came to Yarden [Descender] . And Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] came to Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] , to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Yarden [Descender]."
2 Samuel,19,16,"And Shime’i [Fame] the son of Gera [A Grain] , from the tribe of Binyamin [A Son of the Right Hand] , which [was] of Bachurim [young men’s village] , hasted and came down with the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] to meet king David [beloved]."
2 Samuel,19,17,"And [there were] a thousand men of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] with him, and Tziva [statue] the servant of the house of Sha’ul [desired] , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Yarden [Descender] before the king."
2 Samuel,19,18,"And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shime’i [Fame] the son of Gera [A Grain] fell down before the king, as he was come over Yarden [Descender];"
2 Samuel,19,19,"And said unto the king, Let not my lord impiute (charge to one’s account; reckon) iniquity unto me, neither do you i remember that which you i servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , that the king should take it to his heart."
2 Samuel,19,20,"For you i servant does know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Yosef [ (God) He Shall Add] to go down to meet my lord the king."
2 Samuel,19,21,"But Avishai [my father is a gift] the son of Tz’ruyah [balsam] answered and said, Shall not Shime’i [Fame] be put to death for this, because he cursed the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] anointed?"
2 Samuel,19,22,"And David [beloved] said, What have I to do with you, you 2f sons of Tz’ruyah [balsam] , that you 2f should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ? for do not I know that I [am] this day king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
2 Samuel,19,23,"Therefore the king said unto Shime’i [Fame] , you i shall not die. And the king swore unto him."
2 Samuel,19,24,"And M’fivoshet [exterminating the idol] the son of Sha’ul [desired] came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came [again] in peace."
2 Samuel,19,25,"And it came to pass, when he was come to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to meet the king, that the king said unto him, For what reason went not you i with me, M’fivoshet [exterminating the idol]?"
2 Samuel,19,26,"And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for you i servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because you i servant [is] lame."
2 Samuel,19,27,And he has slandered you i servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king [is] as an angel of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : do therefore [what is] good in you i eyes.
2 Samuel,19,28,For all [of] my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet did you i set you i servant among them that did eat at you i own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?
2 Samuel,19,29,"And the king said unto him, Why speak you i any more of you i matters? I have said, you i and Tziva [statue] divide the land."
2 Samuel,19,30,"And M’fivoshet [exterminating the idol] said unto the king, Yes, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house."
2 Samuel,19,31,"And Barzillai [my iron] the Gil’adi [Hill of Testimony] came down from Rogelim [place of fullers] , and went over Yarden [Descender] with the king, to conduct him over Yarden [Descender]."
2 Samuel,19,32,"Now Barzillai [my iron] was a very aged man, [even] eighty years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Machanayim [Two Camps] ; for he [was] a very great man."
2 Samuel,19,33,"And the king said unto Barzillai [my iron] , Come you i over with me, and I will feed you i with me in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Samuel,19,34,"And Barzillai [my iron] said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]?"
2 Samuel,19,35,I [am] this day eighty years old: [and] can I discern between good and evil? can you i servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should your i servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?
2 Samuel,19,36,You 1s servant will go a little way over Yarden [Descender] with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
2 Samuel,19,37,"Let your i servant, I pray you i , turn back again, that I may die in my own city, [and be buried] by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold your i servant Khimham [their longing] ; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto you i."
2 Samuel,19,38,"And the king answered, Khimham [their longing] shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto you i : and whatsoever you i shall require of me, [that] will I do for you i."
2 Samuel,19,39,"And all the people went over Yarden [Descender] . And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai [my iron] , and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) him; and he returned unto his own place."
2 Samuel,19,40,"Then the king went on to Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] , and Khimham [their longing] went on with him: and all the people of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] conducted the king, and also half the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Samuel,19,41,"And, behold, all the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] stolen you i away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David’s [beloved] ’s men with him, over Yarden [Descender]?"
2 Samuel,19,42,"And all the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] answered the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Because the king [is] near of family to us: wherefore then be you 2f angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king’s [cost] ? or has he given us any gift?"
2 Samuel,19,43,"And the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] answered the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more [right] in David [beloved] than you 2f : why then did you 2f despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] were fiercer than the words of the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Samuel,20,1,"And there happened to be there a man of Belial [Worthless, Good for Nothing] , whose name [was] Sheva [Seven] , the son of Bikhri [youthful] , from the tribe of Binyamin [A Son of the Right Hand] : and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David [beloved] , neither have we inheritance in the son of Yishai [I possess] : every man to his tents, O Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Samuel,20,2,"So every man of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went up from after David [beloved], [and] followed Sheva [Seven] the son of Bikhri [youthful] : but the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] clave unto their king, from Yarden [Descender] even to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Samuel,20,3,"And David [beloved] came to his house at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; and the king took the ten women [his] concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward (in custody, with a guard; prison), and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood."
2 Samuel,20,4,"Then said the king to ‘Amasa [burden] , Assemble me the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] within three days, and be you i here present."
2 Samuel,20,5,So ‘Amasa [burden] went to assemble [the men of] Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] : but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
2 Samuel,20,6,"And David [beloved] said to Avishai [my father is a gift] , Now shall Sheva [Seven] the son of Bikhri [youthful] do us more harm than [did] Avshalom [my father is peace] : take you i your i lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us."
2 Samuel,20,7,"And there went out after him Yo’av [Yehovah is father] ’s men, and the K’reti [executioners] , and the P’leti [couriers] , and all the mighty men: and they went out of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , to pursue after Sheva [Seven] the son of Bikhri [youthful]."
2 Samuel,20,8,"When they [were] at the great stone which [is] in Giv’on [Hill City] , ‘Amasa [burden] went before them. And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] ’s garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a belt [with] a sword fastened upon his waist in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out."
2 Samuel,20,9,"And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] said to ‘Amasa [burden], [Are] you i in health, my brother? And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] took ‘Amasa [burden] by the beard with the right hand to kiss him."
2 Samuel,20,10,"But ‘Amasa [burden] took no heed to the sword that [was] in Yo’av’s [Yehovah is father] ’s hand: so he struck him with that in the fifth [rib] , and shed out his bowels (inward parts; affections) to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Yo’av [Yehovah is father] and Avishai [my father is a gift] his brother pursued after Sheva [Seven] the son of Bikhri [youthful]."
2 Samuel,20,11,"And one of Yo’av [Yehovah is father] ’s men stood by him, and said, He that favours Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , and he that [is] for David [beloved], [let him go] after Yo’av [Yehovah is father]."
2 Samuel,20,12,"And ‘Amasa [burden] wallow (to approve, commend, accept) ed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed ‘Amasa [burden] out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that everyone that came by him stood still."
2 Samuel,20,13,"When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , to pursue after Sheva [Seven] the son of Bikhri [youthful]."
2 Samuel,20,14,"And he went through all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] unto Hevel (herdsman) , and to Beit-Ma’akhah [oppression] [house of pressure] , and all the Berim [my well; of the well] : and they were gathered together, and went also after him."
2 Samuel,20,15,"And they came and besieged him in Hevel (herdsman) of Beit-Ma’akhah [oppression] [house of pressure] , and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that [were] with Yo’av [Yehovah is father] battered the wall, to throw it down."
2 Samuel,20,16,"Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , Come near here, that I may speak with you i."
2 Samuel,20,17,"And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, [Are] you i Yo’av [Yehovah is father] ? And he answered, I [am he] . Then she said unto him, Hear the words of your i female servant. And he answered, I do hear."
2 Samuel,20,18,"Then she spoke, saying, They were wont (used to; in the habit of) to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask [counsel] at Hevel (herdsman) : and so they ended [the matter]."
2 Samuel,20,19,"I [am one of them that are] peaceable [and] faithful in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : you i seek to destroy a city and a mother in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : why will you i swallow (to approve, commend, accept) up the inheritance of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)?"
2 Samuel,20,20,"And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow (to approve, commend, accept) up or destroy."
2 Samuel,20,21,"The matter [is] not so: but a man of mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , Sheva [Seven] the son of Bikhri [youthful] by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, [even] against David [beloved] : deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , Behold, his head shall be thrown to you i over the wall."
2 Samuel,20,22,"Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheva [Seven] the son of Bikhri [youthful] , and cast [it] out to Yo’av [Yehovah is father] . And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] returned to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] unto the king."
2 Samuel,20,23,Now Yo’av [Yehovah is father] [was] over all the host of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] [was] over the K’reti [executioners] and over the P’leti [couriers]:
2 Samuel,20,24,And Adoram [my lord is exalted] [was] over the tribute: and Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] the son of Achilud [child’s brother] [was] recorder:
2 Samuel,20,25,And Sheva [was] scribe: and Tzadok [righteous] and Avyatar [my father is great] [were] the priests:
2 Samuel,20,26,And ‘Ira [watchful of a city] also the Ya’iri [descendant of Ya’ir (He Will Enlighten)] was a chief ruler about David [beloved].
2 Samuel,21,1,"Then there was a famine in the days of David [beloved] three years, year after year; and David [beloved] enquired of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) answered, [It is] for Sha’ul [desired] , and for [his] bloody house, because he killed the Giv’onim [little hill; hilly]."
2 Samuel,21,2,"And the king called the Giv’onim [little hill; hilly] , and said unto them; (now the Giv’onim [little hill; hilly] [were] not of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , but of the remnant of the Emori [Highlanders] ; and the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] had sworn unto them: and Sha’ul [desired] sought to slay them in his zeal to the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] .)"
2 Samuel,21,3,"For what reason David [beloved] said unto the Giv’onim [little hill; hilly] , What shall I do for you? and which shall I make the atonement, that you 2f may bless the inheritance of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)?"
2 Samuel,21,4,"And the Giv’onim [little hill; hilly] said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Sha’ul [desired] , nor of his house; neither for us shall you i kill any man in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] . And he said, What you 2f shall say, [that] will I do for you."
2 Samuel,21,5,"And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us [that] we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God],"
2 Samuel,21,6,"Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in Giv’ah [Hill] of Sha’ul [desired], [whom] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) did choose. And the king said, I will give [them]."
2 Samuel,21,7,"But the king spared M’fivoshet [exterminating the idol] , the son of Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] the son of Sha’ul [desired] , because of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] oath that [was] between them, between David [beloved] and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] the son of Sha’ul [desired]."
2 Samuel,21,8,"But the king took the two sons of Ritzpah [pavement] the daughter of Ayah [falcon] , whom she bore unto Sha’ul [desired] , Armoni [one of the palace] and M’fivoshet [exterminating the idol] ; and the five sons of Mikhal [who is like God?] the daughter of Sha’ul [desired] , whom she brought up for Adri’el [flock of God] the son of Barzillai [my iron] the Mecholati [dancing (in sadness)]:"
2 Samuel,21,9,"And he delivered them into the hands of the Giv’onim [little hill; hilly] , and they hanged them in the hill before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and they fell [all] seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first [days] , in the beginning of barley harvest."
2 Samuel,21,10,"And Ritzpah [pavement] the daughter of Ayah [falcon] took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night."
2 Samuel,21,11,"And it was told David [beloved] what Ritzpah [pavement] the daughter of Ayah [falcon] , the concubine of Sha’ul [desired] , had done."
2 Samuel,21,12,"And David [beloved] went and took the bones of Sha’ul [desired] and the bones of Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] his son from the men of Yavesh-Gil’ad [Dry Hill of Testimony] , which had stolen them from the street of Beit-Sh’an [house of ease] , where the P’lishtim [Immigrants] had hanged them, when the P’lishtim [Immigrants] had slain Sha’ul [desired] in Gilboa [swollen heap]:"
2 Samuel,21,13,And he brought up from there the bones of Sha’ul [desired] and the bones of Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
2 Samuel,21,14,"And the bones of Sha’ul [desired] and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] his son buried they in the country of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] in Tzela [a rib] , in the sepulcher of Kish [bent] his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was entreated for the land."
2 Samuel,21,15,"Moreover the P’lishtim [Immigrants] had yet war again with Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and David [beloved] went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the P’lishtim [Immigrants] : and David [beloved] waxed faint."
2 Samuel,21,16,"And Yishbi-B’nov [his dwelling is in Nov (discourse; prophecy)] , which [was] of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear [weighed] three hundred [shekels] of brass in weight, he being girded with a new [sword] , thought to have slain David [beloved]."
2 Samuel,21,17,"But Avishai [my father is a gift] the son of Tz’ruyah [balsam] succored him, and struck the P’lishtim [immigrants] , and killed him. Then the men of David [beloved] swore unto him, saying, you i shall go no more out with us to battle, that you i quench not the light of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Samuel,21,18,"And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the P’lishtim [Immigrants] at Gov [cistern] : then Sibkhai [weaver] the Hushati [meaning unknown] killed Saf [tall] , which [was] of the sons of the giant."
2 Samuel,21,19,"And there was again a battle in Gov [cistern] with the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , where Elchanan [God has been gracious] the son of Ya’arei-Orgim [forests of weaver] , a Beit-Lachmi [house of bread] , killed [the brother of] Golyat [splendor] the Gitti [belonging to Gat (winepress)] , the staff of whose spear [was] like a weaver’s beam."
2 Samuel,21,20,"And there was yet a battle in Gat [Winepress] , where was a man of [great] stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant."
2 Samuel,21,21,"And when he defied Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] the son of Shim’ah [fame] the brother of David [beloved] killed him."
2 Samuel,21,22,"These four were born to the giant in Gat [Winepress] , and fell by the hand of David [beloved] , and by the hand of his servants."
2 Samuel,22,1,"And David [beloved] spoke unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) the words of this song in the day [that] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Sha’ul [desired]:"
2 Samuel,22,2,"And he said, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;"
2 Samuel,22,3,"The God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of my rock; in him will I trust: [he is] my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; you i save me from violence."
2 Samuel,22,4,"I will call on the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [who is] worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies."
2 Samuel,22,5,"When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;"
2 Samuel,22,6,The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;
2 Samuel,22,7,"In my distress I called upon the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and cried to my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry [did enter] into his ears."
2 Samuel,22,8,"Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was exceedingly angry."
2 Samuel,22,9,"There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it."
2 Samuel,22,10,"He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness [was] under his feet."
2 Samuel,22,11,"And he rode upon a cherub [keruv] , and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind."
2 Samuel,22,12,"And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, [and] thick clouds of the skies."
2 Samuel,22,13,Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.
2 Samuel,22,14,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice."
2 Samuel,22,15,"And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and scattered (defeated in battle) them."
2 Samuel,22,16,"And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , at the blast of the breath of his nostrils."
2 Samuel,22,17,"He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;"
2 Samuel,22,18,"He delivered me from my strong enemy, [and] from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me."
2 Samuel,22,19,They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was my stay.
2 Samuel,22,20,"He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me."
2 Samuel,22,21,The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.
2 Samuel,22,22,"For I have kept the ways of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and have not wickedly departed from my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
2 Samuel,22,23,"For all his judgments [were] before me: and [as for] his statutes, I did not depart from them."
2 Samuel,22,24,"I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from my iniquity."
2 Samuel,22,25,Therefore the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.
2 Samuel,22,26,"With the merciful you i will show yourself merciful, [and] with the upright man you i will show yourself upright."
2 Samuel,22,27,With the pure you i will show yourself pure; and with the perverse (twisted) [habitually disposed to disobedience and opposition] you i will show yourself unsavoury.
2 Samuel,22,28,"And the afflicted people you i will save: but your i eyes [are] upon the arrogant (proud; lifted up), [that] you i may bring [them] down."
2 Samuel,22,29,"For you i [are] my lamp, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will lighten my darkness."
2 Samuel,22,30,For by you i I have run through a troop: by my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] have I leaped over a wall.
2 Samuel,22,31," [As for] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , his way [is] perfect; the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] tried: he [is] a buckler (round shielf held with a grip) to all them that trust in him."
2 Samuel,22,32,"For who [is] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , save the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ? and who [is] a rock, save our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]?"
2 Samuel,22,33,God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is] my strength [and] power: and he makes my way perfect.
2 Samuel,22,34,He makes my feet like hinds’ [feet] : and sets me upon my high places.
2 Samuel,22,35,He teaches my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms.
2 Samuel,22,36,you i have also given me the shield of your i salvation: and your i gentleness has made me great.
2 Samuel,22,37,you i have enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.
2 Samuel,22,38,"I have pursued my enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them."
2 Samuel,22,39,"And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yes, they are fallen under my feet."
2 Samuel,22,40,For you i have girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me have you i subdued under me.
2 Samuel,22,41,"you i have also given me the necks of my enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me."
2 Samuel,22,42,"They looked, but [there was] none to save; [even] unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , but he answered them not."
2 Samuel,22,43,"Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, [and] did spread them abroad."
2 Samuel,22,44,"you i also have delivered me from the strivings of my people, you i have kept me [to be] head of the heathen: a people [which] I knew not shall serve me."
2 Samuel,22,45,"Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me."
2 Samuel,22,46,"Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places."
2 Samuel,22,47,The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives; and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] my rock; and exalted be the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of the rock of my salvation.
2 Samuel,22,48,"It [is] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] that avenges me, and that brings down the people under me,"
2 Samuel,22,49,And that brings me forth from my enemies: you i also have lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: you i have delivered me from the violent man.
2 Samuel,22,50,"Therefore I will give thanks unto you i , O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto your i name."
2 Samuel,22,51," [He is] the tower of salvation for his king: and shows mercy to his anointed, unto David [beloved] , and to his seed forevermore."
2 Samuel,23,1,"Now these [be] the last words of David [beloved] . David [beloved] the son of Yishai [I possess] said, and the man [who was] raised up on high, the anointed of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Ya’akov [Heal of God] , and the sweet psalmist of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , said,"
2 Samuel,23,2,"The Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke by me, and his word [was] in my tongue."
2 Samuel,23,3,"The God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said, the Rock of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] spoke to me, He that rules over men [must be] just, ruling in the fear of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
2 Samuel,23,4,"And [he shall be] as the light of the morning, [when] the sun rises, [even] a morning without clouds; [as] the tender grass [springing] out of the earth by clear shining after rain."
2 Samuel,23,5,"Although my house [be] not so with God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all [things] , and sure: for [this is] all my salvation, and all [my] desire, although he make [it] not to grow."
2 Samuel,23,6,"But [the sons] of Belial [Worthless, Good for Nothing] [shall be] all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:"
2 Samuel,23,7,"But the man [that] shall to (to do entirely, do wholly) uch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the [same] place."
2 Samuel,23,8,"These [be] the names of the mighty men whom David [beloved] had: The Tach’kmoni [you will make me wise] that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same [was] ‘Adino [his ornament] his ornament the ‘Etzni [sharp, strong, spear]: [he lift up his spear] against eight hundred, whom he killed at one time."
2 Samuel,23,9,"And after him [was] El’azar [God has helped] the son of Dodo [his beloved] the Achochi [God prevails], [one] of the three mighty men with David [beloved] , when they defied the P’lishtim [Immigrants] [that] were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were gone away:"
2 Samuel,23,10,"He arose, and struck the P’lishtim [Immigrants] until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil (plunder; prey; booty)."
2 Samuel,23,11,"And after him [was] Shammah [astonishment] the son of Age [I shall increase] the Harari [mountain dweller] . And the P’lishtim [Immigrants] were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."
2 Samuel,23,12,"But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and killed the P’lishtim [Immigrants] : and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) wrought a great victory."
2 Samuel,23,13,"And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David [beloved] in the harvest time unto the cave of ‘Adulam [Justice of the People] : and the troop of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] pitched in the valley of Refa’im [giants]."
2 Samuel,23,14,"And David [beloved] [was] then in an hold, and the Garrison (fortification; military post) of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] [was] then [in] Beit-Lechem [House of Bread]."
2 Samuel,23,15,"And David [beloved] longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] , which [is] by the gate!"
2 Samuel,23,16,"And the three mighty men broke through the host of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and drew water out of the well of Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] , that [was] by the gate, and took [it] , and brought [it] to David [beloved] : nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Samuel,23,17,"And he said, Be it far from me, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that I should do this: [is not this] the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men."
2 Samuel,23,18,"And Avishai [my father is a gift] , the brother of Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , the son of Tz’ruyah [balsam] , was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, [and] killed [them] , and had the name among three."
2 Samuel,23,19,Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the [first] three.
2 Samuel,23,20,"And B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] , the son of a valiant man, of Kavtze’el [God Gathers] , who had done many acts, he killed two lionlike men of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] : he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:"
2 Samuel,23,21,"And he killed an Mitzri [Egyptian] , a goodly man: and the Mitzri [Egyptian] had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Mitzri [Egyptian] ’s hand, and killed him with his own spear."
2 Samuel,23,22,"These [things] did B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] , and had the name among three mighty men."

2 Samuel,24,10,"And David’s [beloved] ’s heart struck him after that he had numbered the people. And David [beloved] said unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , take away the iniquity of you i servant; for I have done very foolishly."
2 Samuel,24,11,"For when David [beloved] was up in the morning, the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto the prophet Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] , David’s [beloved] ’s seer, saying,"
2 Samuel,24,12,"Go and say unto David [beloved] , Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , I offer you i three [things] ; choose you i one of them, that I may [do it] unto you i."
2 Samuel,24,13,"So Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] came to David [beloved] , and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto you i in your i land? or will you i flee three months before your i enemies, while they pursue you i ? or that there be three days’ pestilence in your i land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me."
2 Samuel,24,14,"And David [beloved] said unto Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] , I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; for his mercies [are] great: and let me not fall into the hand of man."
2 Samuel,24,15,So the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent a pestilence upon Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan [Judge] even to Be’er-sheva [Well of the sevenfold Oath] seventy thousand men.
2 Samuel,24,16,"And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to destroy it, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now your i hand. And the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was by the threshing place of Aravnah [I shall shout for joy] the Y’vusi [Threshers]."
2 Samuel,24,17,"And David [beloved] spoke unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) when he saw the angel that struck the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let your i hand, I pray you i , be against me, and against my father’s house."
2 Samuel,24,18,"And Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] came that day to David [beloved] , and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in the threshing floor of Aravnah [I shall shout for joy] the Y’vusi [Threshers]."
2 Samuel,24,19,"And David [beloved] , according to the saying of Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] , went up as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded."
2 Samuel,24,20,"And Aravnah [I shall shout for joy] looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Aravnah [I shall shout for joy] went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground."
2 Samuel,24,21,"And Aravnah [I shall shout for joy] said, For what reason is my lord the king come to his servant? And David [beloved] said, To buy the threshing floor of you i , to build an altar unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that the plague may be detained (held) from the people."
2 Samuel,24,22,"And Aravnah [I shall shout for joy] said unto David [beloved] , Let my lord the king take and offer up what [seems] good unto him: behold, [here be] oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and [other] instruments of the oxen for wood."
2 Samuel,24,23,"All these [things] did Aravnah [I shall shout for joy], [as] a king, give unto the king. And Aravnah [I shall shout for joy] said unto the king, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] accept you i."
2 Samuel,24,24,"And the king said unto Aravnah [I shall shout for joy] , No; but I will surely buy [it] of you i at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of that which does cost me nothing. So David [beloved] bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver."
2 Samuel,24,25,"And David [beloved] built there an altar unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was entreated for the land, and the plague was detained (held) from Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
