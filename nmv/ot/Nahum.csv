Nahum,1,1,"The burden of Nineveh [abode of Ninus, or Offspring’s Habitation] . The book of the vision of Nachum [comfort] the Elkoshi [God is ensnarer]."
Nahum,1,2,"God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is] jealous, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) revenges; the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) revenges, and [is] furious; the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserves [wrath] for his enemies."
Nahum,1,3,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit [the wicked] : the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds [are] the dust of his feet."
Nahum,1,4,"He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers: Bashan [Fruitful] languishes, and Carmel [Garden-land] , and the flower of L’vanon [Whiteness] languishes."
Nahum,1,5,"The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yes, the world, and all that dwell in it."
Nahum,1,6,"Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him."
Nahum,1,7,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knows them that trust in him."
Nahum,1,8,"But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies."
Nahum,1,9,What do you 2f imagine against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.
Nahum,1,10,"For while [they be] folded together [as] thorns, and while they are drunken [as] drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry."
Nahum,1,11,"There is [one] come out of you i , that imagines evil against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , a wicked counselor."
Nahum,1,12,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; Though [they be] quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted you i , I will afflict you i no more."
Nahum,1,13,"For now will I break his yoke from off you i , and will burst your i bonds in sunder."
Nahum,1,14,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has given a commandment concerning you i, [that] no more of your i name be sown: out of the house of your i gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make your i grave; for you i are vile."
Nahum,1,15,"Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that brings good tidings, that proclaims peace! O Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , keep your i solemn feasts, perform your i vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through you i ; he is utterly cut off."
Nahum,2,1,"He that dashes in pieces is come up before your i face: keep the munitions, watch the way, make [your i ] waist strong, fortify [your i ] power mightily."
Nahum,2,2,"For the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has turned away the excellency of Ya’akov [Heal of God] , as the excellency of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches."
Nahum,2,3,"The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men [are] in scarlet: the chariots [shall be] with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken."
Nahum,2,4,"The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall jostle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings."
Nahum,2,5,"He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defense shall be prepared."
Nahum,2,6,"The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved."
Nahum,2,7,"And It is fixed. She shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her handmaids shall moan as with the voice of doves, beating upon their breasts."
Nahum,2,8,"But Nineveh [abode of Ninus, or Offspring’s Habitation] [is] of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, [shall they cry] ; but none shall look back."
Nahum,2,9,"Take you 2f the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) of silver, take the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) of gold: for [there is] none end of the store [and] glory out of all the pleasant furniture."
Nahum,2,10,"She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melts, and the knees strike together, and much pain [is] in all waist, and the faces of them all gather blackness."
Nahum,2,11,"Where [is] the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion, [even] the old lion, walked, [and] the lion’s whelp (a cub; a young one) , and none made [them] afraid?"
Nahum,2,12,"The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin."
Nahum,2,13,"Behold, I [am] against you i , says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour your i young lions: and I will cut off your i prey from the earth, and the voice of your i messengers shall no more be heard."
Nahum,3,1,Woe to the bloody city! it [is] all full of lies [and] robbery; the prey departs not;
Nahum,3,2,"The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the prancing horses, and of the jumping chariots."
Nahum,3,3,"The horseman lifts up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and [there is] a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcasses; and [there is] none end of [their] corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:"
Nahum,3,4,"Because of the multitude of the cult prostitution of the well-favored prostitute, the mistress of witchcrafts, that sells nations through her cult prostitution, and families through her witchcrafts."
Nahum,3,5,"Behold, I [am] against you i , says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; and I will lift your i skirts over your i face, and I will show the nations your i nakedness, and the kingdoms your i shame."
Nahum,3,6,"And I will cast abominable filth upon you i , and make you i vile, and will set you i as a gazingstock."
Nahum,3,7,"And it shall come to pass, [that] all they that look upon you i shall flee from you i , and say, Nineveh [abode of Ninus, or Offspring’s Habitation] is laid waste: who will bemoan her? from what place shall I seek comforters for you i?"
Nahum,3,8,"Are you i better than No-Amon [master workman - disrupting] , that was situated among the rivers (of Egypt), [that had] the waters round about it, whose fortification (defensive structure) [was] the sea, [and] her wall [was] from the sea?"
Nahum,3,9,"Ethiopia [Kush] and Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] [were] her strength, and [it was] infinite; Put [a bow] and Lubim [empty-hearted] were your i helpers."
Nahum,3,10,"Yet [was] she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains."
Nahum,3,11,"you i also shall be drunken: you i shall be hid, you i also shall seek refuge because of the enemy."
Nahum,3,12,"All your i strong holds [shall be like] fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater."
Nahum,3,13,"Behold, your i people in the midst of you i [behave like] women: the gates of your i land shall be set wide open unto your i enemies: the fire shall devour your i bars."
Nahum,3,14,"Draw yourselfi waters for the siege, fortify your i strong holds: go into clay, and trample the mortar, make strong the brick factory."
Nahum,3,15,"There shall the fire devour you i ; the sword shall cut you i off, it shall eat you i up like the cankerworm: make yourself many as the cankerworm, make yourself many as the locusts."
Nahum,3,16,"you i have multiplied your i merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoils, and flies away."
Nahum,3,17,"Your 1s guardsmen [are] as the locusts, and your i captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, [but] when the sun arises they flee away, and their place is not known where they [are]."
Nahum,3,18,"Your 1s shepherds slumber, O king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) : your i nobles shall dwell [in the dust] : your i people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathers [them]."
Nahum,3,19, [There is] no healing of your i bruise; your i wound is grievous: all that hear the report of you i shall clap the hands over you i : for upon whom has not your i wickedness passed continually?
