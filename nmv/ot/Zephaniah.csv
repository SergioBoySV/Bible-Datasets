Zephaniah,1,1,"The word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) which came unto Tzefan’yahu [Yehovah has treasured] the son of Kushi [their blackness] , the son of G’dalyahu [Yehovah is great] , the son of Amaryah [Yehovah speaks] , the son of Hizkiyah [Yehovah is my strength] , in the days of Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] the son of ‘Amon [master workman] , king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
Zephaniah,1,2,"I will utterly consume all [things] from off the land, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Zephaniah,1,3,"I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Zephaniah,1,4,"I will also stretch out my hand upon Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and upon all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; and I will cut off the remnant of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] from this place, [and] the name of the idolatrous with the priests;"
Zephaniah,1,5,"And them that worship the army of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship [and] that swear by the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and that swear by Malkam [king];"
Zephaniah,1,6,"And them that are turned back from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and [those] that have not sought the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , nor enquired for him."
Zephaniah,1,7,"Hold your i peace at the presence of the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) : for the day of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] at hand: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has prepared a sacrifice, he has bid his guests."
Zephaniah,1,8,"And it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king’s children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparel."
Zephaniah,1,9,"In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters’ houses with violence and deceit."
Zephaniah,1,10,"And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [that there shall be] the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills."
Zephaniah,1,11,"Howl, you 2f inhabitants of Makhatesh [a mortar or deep hollow] , for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off."
Zephaniah,1,12,"And it shall come to pass at that time, [that] I will search Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees (sediment settled in liquid; the dregs) : that say in their heart, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will not do good, neither will he do evil."
Zephaniah,1,13,"Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit [them] ; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof."
Zephaniah,1,14,"The great day of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] near, [it is] near, and hastes greatly, [even] the voice of the day of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : the mighty man shall cry there bitterly."
Zephaniah,1,15,"That day [is] a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,"
Zephaniah,1,16,"A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers."
Zephaniah,1,17,"And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung."
Zephaniah,1,18,Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.
Zephaniah,2,1,"Gather yourselves together, yes, gather together, O nation not desired;"
Zephaniah,2,2,"Before the decree bring forth, [before] the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) come upon you, before the day of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] anger come upon you."
Zephaniah,2,3,"Seek you 2f the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , all you 2f meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be you 2f shall be hid in the day of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] anger."
Zephaniah,2,4,"For ‘Azah [The Strong] shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon [The Fire of Infamy: I shall be Weighed] a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod [powerful] at the noon day, and ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots] shall be rooted up."
Zephaniah,2,5,"Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the K’reti [executioners] ! the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] against you; O Kena’an [Merchant] , the land of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , I will even destroy you i , that there shall be no inhabitant."
Zephaniah,2,6,"And the sea coast shall be dwellings [and] cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks."
Zephaniah,2,7,"And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon [The Fire of Infamy: I shall be Weighed] shall they lie down in the evening: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shall visit them, and turn away their captivity."
Zephaniah,2,8,"I have heard the reproach (disgrace; shame) of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , and the revilings of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified [themselves] against their border."
Zephaniah,2,9,"Therefore [as] I live, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Surely Mo’av [Seed of my Father] shall be as S’dom [Burning] , and the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] as ‘Amora [Submersion], [even] the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue (part that remains, the rest) of my people shall spoil (plunder; prey; booty) them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them."
Zephaniah,2,10,"This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified [themselves] against the people of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Zephaniah,2,11,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [will be] terrible unto them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and [men] shall worship him, everyone from his place, [even] all the isles of the heathen."
Zephaniah,2,12,"You 2f Cushi [Ethiopians] also, you 2f [shall be] slain by my sword."
Zephaniah,2,13,"And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) ; and will make Nineveh [abode of Ninus, or Offspring’s Habitation] a desolation, [and] dry like a wilderness."
Zephaniah,2,14,"And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the hedgehogs shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; [their] voice shall sing in the windows; desolation [shall be] in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work."
Zephaniah,2,15,"This [is] the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I [am] , and [there is] none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! everyone that passes by her shall hiss, [and] wag his hand."
Zephaniah,3,1,"Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!"
Zephaniah,3,2,She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; she drew not near to her God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered].
Zephaniah,3,3,Her princes within her [are] roaring lions; her [are] evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.
Zephaniah,3,4,"Her prophets [are] light [and] treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law."
Zephaniah,3,5,"The just Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning does he bring his judgment to light, he fails not; but the unjust knows no shame."
Zephaniah,3,6,"I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passes by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant."
Zephaniah,3,7,"I said, Surely you i will fear me, you i will receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, [and] corrupted all their doings."
Zephaniah,3,8,"Therefore wait you 2f upon me, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination [is] to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them my indignation, [even] all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy."
Zephaniah,3,9,"For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to serve him with one consent."
Zephaniah,3,10,"From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia [Kush] my worshippers, [even] the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring my offering."
Zephaniah,3,11,"In that day shall you i not be ashamed for all your i doings, wherein you i have transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of you i them that rejoice in your i pride, and you i shall no more be arrogant (proud; lifted up) because of my holy mountain."
Zephaniah,3,12,"I will also leave in the midst of you i an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Zephaniah,3,13,"The remnant of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make [them] afraid."
Zephaniah,3,14,"Sing, O daughter of Tziyon [parched place] ; shout, O Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Zephaniah,3,15,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has taken away your i judgments, he has cast out your i enemy: the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [even] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [is] in the midst of you i : you i shall not see evil any more."
Zephaniah,3,16,"In that day it shall be said to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , Fear you i not: [and to] Tziyon [parched place] , Let not you i hands be slack."
Zephaniah,3,17,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in the midst of you i [is] mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over you i with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over you i with singing."
Zephaniah,3,18,"I will gather [them that are] sorrowful for the solemn assembly, [who] are of you i, [to whom] the reproach (disgrace; shame) of it [was] a burden."
Zephaniah,3,19,"Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict you i : and I will save her that is lame, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame."
Zephaniah,3,20,"At that time will I bring you [again] , even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
