Ezekiel,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month] , in the fifth [day] of the month, as I [was] among the captives by the river of, [that] the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ezekiel,1,2,"In the fifth [day] of the month, which [was] the fifth year of king Y’hoyakhin’s [Yehovah establishes] ’s captivity,"
Ezekiel,1,3,"The word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came expressly unto Yechezk’el [God strengthens] the priest, the son of Buzi [my contempt] , in the land of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] by the river K’var [far-off] ; and the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was there upon him."
Ezekiel,1,4,"And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness [was] about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire."
Ezekiel,1,5,Also out of the midst thereof [came] the likeness of four living creatures. And this [was] their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.
Ezekiel,1,6,"And everyone had four faces, and everyone had four wings."
Ezekiel,1,7,And their feet [were] straight feet; and the sole of their feet [was] like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.
Ezekiel,1,8,And [they had] the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.
Ezekiel,1,9,Their wings [were] joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went everyone straight forward.
Ezekiel,1,10,"As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle."
Ezekiel,1,11,"Thus [were] their faces: and their wings [were] stretched upward; two [wings] of everyone [were] joined one to another, and two covered their bodies."
Ezekiel,1,12,"And they went everyone straight forward: to which the spirit was to go, they went; [and] they turned not when they went."
Ezekiel,1,13,"As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance [was] like burning coals of fire, [and] like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning."
Ezekiel,1,14,And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
Ezekiel,1,15,"Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces."
Ezekiel,1,16,The appearance of the wheels and their work [was] like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work [was] as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
Ezekiel,1,17,"When they went, they went upon their four sides: [and] they turned not when they went."
Ezekiel,1,18,"As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings [were] full of eyes round about them four."
Ezekiel,1,19,"And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up."
Ezekiel,1,20,"Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, there [was their] spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature [was] in the wheels."
Ezekiel,1,21,"When those went, [these] went; and when those stood, [these] stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature [was] in the wheels."
Ezekiel,1,22,"And the likeness of the Firmament (expanse or vault over the earth) upon the heads of the living creature [was] as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above."
Ezekiel,1,23,"And under the Firmament (expanse or vault over the earth) [were] their wings straight, the one toward the other: everyone had two, which covered on this side, and everyone had two, which covered on that side, their bodies."
Ezekiel,1,24,"And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings."
Ezekiel,1,25,"And there was a voice from the Firmament (expanse or vault over the earth) that [was] over their heads, when they stood, [and] had let down their wings."
Ezekiel,1,26,"And above the Firmament (expanse or vault over the earth) that [was] over their heads [was] the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne [was] the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it."
Ezekiel,1,27,"And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his waist even upward, and from the appearance of his waist even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about."
Ezekiel,1,28,"As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so [was] the appearance of the brightness round about. This [was] the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . And when I saw [it] , I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke."
Ezekiel,2,1,"And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon your i feet, and I will speak unto you i."
Ezekiel,2,2,"And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spoke unto me."
Ezekiel,2,3,"And he said unto me, Son of man, I send you i to the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, [even] unto this very day."
Ezekiel,2,4,"For [they are] impudent (shameless; without modesty) children and stiffhearted. I do send you i unto them; and you i shall say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,2,5,"And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will refrain (restrain; refrein from acting) , (for they [are] a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them."
Ezekiel,2,6,"And you i , Son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns [be] with you i , and you i do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they [be] a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,2,7,"And you i shall speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will refrain (restrain; refrein from acting) : for they [are] most rebellious."
Ezekiel,2,8,"But you i , Son of man, hear what I say unto you i ; Be not you i rebellious like that rebellious house: open your i mouth, and eat that I give you i."
Ezekiel,2,9,"And when I looked, behold, an hand [was] sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book [was] in it;"
Ezekiel,2,10,"And he spread it before me; and it [was] written within and without: and [there was] written in it lamentations, and mourning, and woe."
Ezekiel,3,1,"Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that you i find; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,3,2,"So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll."
Ezekiel,3,3,"And he said unto me, Son of man, cause you i belly to eat, and fill your i bowels (inward parts; affections) with this roll that I give you i . Then did I eat [it] ; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness."
Ezekiel,3,4,"And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get you i unto the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and speak with my words unto them."
Ezekiel,3,5,"For you i [are] not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, [but] to the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God];"
Ezekiel,3,6,"Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words you i can not understand. Surely, had I sent you i to them, they would have listened unto you i."
Ezekiel,3,7,But the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] will not hearken unto you i ; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [are] impudent (shameless; without modesty) and hardhearted.
Ezekiel,3,8,"Behold, I have made your i face strong against their faces, and your i forehead strong against their foreheads."
Ezekiel,3,9,"As an adamant harder than flint have I made your i forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they [be] a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,3,10,"Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto you i receive in your i heart, and hear with your i ears."
Ezekiel,3,11,"And go, get you i to them of the captivity, unto the children of your i people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; whether they will hear, or whether they will refrain (restrain; refrein from acting)."
Ezekiel,3,12,"Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, [saying] , Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) from his place."
Ezekiel,3,13," [I heard] also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing."
Ezekiel,3,14,"So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was strong upon me."
Ezekiel,3,15,"Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-Aviv [mound of the flood] , that dwelt by the river of K’var [far-off] , and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days."
Ezekiel,3,16,"And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,3,17,"Son of man, I have made you i a watchman unto the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me."
Ezekiel,3,18,"When I say unto the wicked, you i shall surely die; and you i give him not warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked [man] shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your i hand."
Ezekiel,3,19,"Yet if you i warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you i have delivered your i soul."
Ezekiel,3,20,"Again, When a righteous [man] does turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because you i have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at your i hand."
Ezekiel,3,21,"Nevertheless if you i warn the righteous [man] , that the righteous sin not, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also you i have delivered your i soul."
Ezekiel,3,22,"And the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you i."
Ezekiel,3,23,"Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of K’var [far-off] : and I fell on my face."
Ezekiel,3,24,"Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut yourself within you i house."
Ezekiel,3,25,"But you i , O Son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon you i , and shall bind you i with them, and you i shall not go out among them:"
Ezekiel,3,26,"And I will make your i tongue cleave (split open; cut open; divide) to the roof of your i mouth, that you i shall be dumb, and shall not be to them a reprover: for they [are] a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,3,27,"But when I speak with you i , I will open your i mouth, and you i shall say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; He that hears, let him hear; and he that forbears, let him refrain (restrain; refrein from acting) : for they [are] a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,4,1,"You i also, Son of man, take you i a tile, and lay it before you i , and portray upon it the city, [even] Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]:"
Ezekiel,4,2,"And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set [battering] rams against it round about."
Ezekiel,4,3,"Moreover take you i unto you i an iron pan, and set it [for] a wall of iron between you i and the city: and set your i face against it, and it shall be besieged, and you i shall lay siege against it. This [shall be] a sign to the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,4,4,"Lie you i also upon your i left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] upon it: [according] to the number of the days that you i shall lie upon it you i shall bear their iniquity."
Ezekiel,4,5,"For I have laid upon you i the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shall you i bear the iniquity of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,4,6,"And when you i have accomplished them, lie again on your i right side, and you i shall bear the iniquity of the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] forty days: I have appointed you i each day for a year."
Ezekiel,4,7,"Therefore you i shall set your i face toward the siege of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and your i arm [shall be] uncovered, and you i shall prophesy against it."
Ezekiel,4,8,"And, behold, I will lay bands upon you i , and you i shall not turn you i from one side to another, till you i have ended the days of your i siege."
Ezekiel,4,9,"Take you i also unto you i wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches (a kind of grain used for seasoning) , and put them in one vessel, and make you i bread thereof, [according] to the number of the days that you i shall lie upon you i side, three hundred and ninety days shall you i eat thereof."
Ezekiel,4,10,"And you i meat which you i shall eat [shall be] by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shall you i eat it."
Ezekiel,4,11,"You i shall drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin [a quart] : from time to time shall you i drink."
Ezekiel,4,12,"And you i shall eat it [as] barley cakes, and you i shall bake it with dung that comes out of man, in their sight."
Ezekiel,4,13,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, Even thus shall the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, to which I will drive them."
Ezekiel,4,14,"Then said I, Ah Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ! behold, my soul has not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth."
Ezekiel,4,15,"Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given you i cow’s dung for man’s dung, and you i shall prepare your i bread with that."
Ezekiel,4,16,"Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:"
Ezekiel,4,17,"That they may lack bread and water, and be astonished one with another, and consume away for their iniquity."
Ezekiel,5,1,"And you i , Son of man, take you i a sharp knife, take you i a barber’s razor, and cause [it] to pass upon your i head and upon your i beard: then take you i balances to weigh, and divide the [hair]."
Ezekiel,5,2,"You i shall burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and you i shall take a third part, [and] strike about it with a knife: and a third part you i shall scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them."
Ezekiel,5,3,"You i shall also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in your i skirts."
Ezekiel,5,4,"Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; [for] thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,5,5,Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; This [is] Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries [that are] round about her.
Ezekiel,5,6,"And she has changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that [are] round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them."
Ezekiel,5,7,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Because you 2f multiplied more than the nations that [are] round about you, [and] have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that [are] round about you;"
Ezekiel,5,8,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I, even I, [am] against you i , and will execute judgments in the midst of your i in the sight of the nations."
Ezekiel,5,9,"And I will do in you i that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all you i abominations."
Ezekiel,5,10,"Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you i , and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in you i , and the whole remnant of you i will I scatter into all the winds."
Ezekiel,5,11,"For what reason, [as] I live, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Surely, because you i have defiled my sanctuary with all your i detestable things, and with all your i abominations, therefore will I also diminish [you i ] ; neither shall my eye spare, neither will I have any pity."
Ezekiel,5,12,"A third part of you i shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of you i : and a third part shall fall by the sword round about you i ; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them."
Ezekiel,5,13,"Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have spoken [it] in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them."
Ezekiel,5,14,"Moreover I will make you i waste, and a reproach (disgrace; shame) among the nations that [are] round about you i , in the sight of all that pass by."
Ezekiel,5,15,"So it shall be a reproach (disgrace; shame) and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that [are] round about you i , when I shall execute judgments in you i in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have spoken [it]."
Ezekiel,5,16,"When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for [their] destruction, [and] which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:"
Ezekiel,5,17,"So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave you i ; and pestilence and blood shall pass through you i ; and I will bring the sword upon you i . I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have spoken [it]."
Ezekiel,6,1,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,6,2,"Son of man, set your i face toward the mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and prophesy against them,"
Ezekiel,6,3,"And say, You 2f mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , hear the word of the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, [even] I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places."
Ezekiel,6,4,"And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain [men] before your idols."
Ezekiel,6,5,And I will lay the dead carcasses of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.

Ezekiel,6,7,"And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,6,8,"Yet will I leave a remnant, that you 2f may have [some] that shall escape the sword among the nations, when you 2f shall be scattered through the countries."
Ezekiel,6,9,"And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations to which they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations."
Ezekiel,6,10,"And they shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [and that] I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them."
Ezekiel,6,11,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Strike with your i hand, and stamp with your i foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence."
Ezekiel,6,12,He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remains and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.
Ezekiel,6,13,"Then shall you 2f know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , when their slain [men] shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer soothing aroma to all their idols."
Ezekiel,6,14,"So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yes, more desolate than the wilderness toward Divlah [the place of the fig cake] , in all their habitations: and they shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,7,1,"Moreover the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"

Ezekiel,7,4,"And my eye shall not spare you i , neither will I have pity: but I will recompense your i ways upon you i , and your i abominations shall be in the midst of you i : and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,7,5,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come."
Ezekiel,7,6,"An end is come, the end is come: it watch for you i ; behold, it is come."
Ezekiel,7,7,"The morning is come unto you i , O you i that dwell in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble [is] near, and not the sounding again of the mountains."

Ezekiel,7,12,"The time is come, the day draws near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath [is] upon all the multitude thereof."

Ezekiel,7,14,"They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goes to the battle: for my wrath [is] upon all the multitude thereof."

Ezekiel,7,19,"They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels (inward parts; affections) : because it is the stumbling block of their iniquity."
Ezekiel,7,20,"As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations [and] of their detestable things in it: therefore have I set it far from them."
Ezekiel,7,21,"And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil (plunder; prey; booty) ; and they shall pollute it."
Ezekiel,7,22,"My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret [place] : for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it."

Ezekiel,7,27,"The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,8,1,"And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth [month] , in the fifth [day] of the month, [as] I sat in my house, and the elders of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] sat before me, that the hand of the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) fell there upon me."

Ezekiel,8,3,"And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where [was] the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy."
Ezekiel,8,4,"And, behold, the glory of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [was] there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain."
Ezekiel,8,5,"Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up your i eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry."
Ezekiel,8,6,"He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, see you i what they do? [even] the great abominations that the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn you i yet again, [and] you i shall see greater abominations."
Ezekiel,8,7,"And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall."
Ezekiel,8,8,"Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had excavated in the wall, behold a door."
Ezekiel,8,9,"And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here."
Ezekiel,8,10,"So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , portrayed upon the wall round about."
Ezekiel,8,11,"And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and in the midst of them stood Ya’azanyahu [Yehovah hears] the son of Shafan [coney] , with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up."
Ezekiel,8,12,"Then said he unto me, Son of man, have you i seen what the ancients of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sees us not; the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has forsaken the earth."
Ezekiel,8,13,"He said also unto me, Turn you i yet again, [and] you i shall see greater abominations that they do."
Ezekiel,8,14,"Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] house which [was] toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz (a Babylonian goddess) [sprout of life]."
Ezekiel,8,15,"Then said he unto me, Have you i seen [this] , O Son of man? turn you i yet again, [and] you i shall see greater abominations than these."
Ezekiel,8,16,"And he brought me into the inner court of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , between the porch and the altar, [were] about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east."
Ezekiel,8,17,"Then he said unto me, Have you i seen [this] , O Son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose."
Ezekiel,8,18,"Therefore will I also deal in fury: my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, [yet] will I not hear them."
Ezekiel,9,1,"He cried also in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man [with] his destroying weapon in his hand."
Ezekiel,9,2,"And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lies toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them [was] clothed with linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar."
Ezekiel,9,3,"And the glory of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] was gone up from the cherub [keruv] , whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which [had] the writer’s inkhorn by his side;"
Ezekiel,9,4,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof."
Ezekiel,9,5,"And to the others he said in my hearing, Go you 2f after him through the city, and strike: let not your eye spare, neither have you 2f pity:"
Ezekiel,9,6,"Slay utterly old [and] young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom [is] the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which [were] before the house."
Ezekiel,9,7,"And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go you 2f forth. And they went forth, and killed in the city."
Ezekiel,9,8,"And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ! will you i destroy all the residue (part that remains, the rest) of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in your i pouring out of your i fury upon Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]?"
Ezekiel,9,9,"Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] [is] exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has forsaken the earth, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sees not."
Ezekiel,9,10,"And as for me also, my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, [but] I will recompense their way upon their head."
Ezekiel,9,11,"And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which [had] the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as you i have commanded me."
Ezekiel,10,1,"Then I looked, and, behold, in the Firmament (expanse or vault over the earth) that was above the head of the k’vurim (cherubim) there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne."
Ezekiel,10,2,"And he spoke unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, [even] under the cherub [keruv] , and fill your i hand with coals of fire from between the k’vurim (cherubim) , and scatter [them] over the city. And he went in in my sight."
Ezekiel,10,3,"Now the k’vurim (cherubim) stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court."
Ezekiel,10,4,"Then the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) went up from the cherub [keruv], [and stood] over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] glory."
Ezekiel,10,5,"And the sound of the k’vurim (cherubim)’ wings was heard [even] to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty (Shaddai) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] when he speaks."
Ezekiel,10,6,"And it came to pass, [that] when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the k’vurim (cherubim) ; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels."
Ezekiel,10,7,"And [one] cherub [keruv] stretched forth his hand from between the k’vurim (cherubim) unto the fire that [was] between the k’vurim (cherubim) , and took [thereof] , and put [it] into the hands of [him that was] clothed with linen: who took [it] , and went out."
Ezekiel,10,8,And there appeared in the k’vurim (cherubim) the form of a man’s hand under their wings.
Ezekiel,10,9,"And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the k’vurim (cherubim) , one wheel by one cherub [keruv] , and another wheel by another cherub [keruv] : and the appearance of the wheels [was] as the colour of a beryl stone."
Ezekiel,10,10,"And [as for] their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel."
Ezekiel,10,11,"When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place to which the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went."
Ezekiel,10,12,"And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, [were] full of eyes round about, [even] the wheels that they four had."
Ezekiel,10,13,"As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel."
Ezekiel,10,14,"And everyone had four faces: the first face [was] the face of a cherub [keruv] , and the second face [was] the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle."
Ezekiel,10,15,And the k’vurim (cherubim) were lifted up. This [is] the living creature that I saw by the river of K’var [far-off].
Ezekiel,10,16,"And when the k’vurim (cherubim) went, the wheels went by them: and when the k’vurim (cherubim) lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them."
Ezekiel,10,17,"When they stood, [these] stood; and when they were lifted up, [these] lifted up themselves [also] : for the spirit of the living creature [was] in them."
Ezekiel,10,18,"Then the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the k’vurim (cherubim)."
Ezekiel,10,19,"And the k’vurim (cherubim) lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also [were] beside them, and [everyone] stood at the door of the east gate of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] house; and the glory of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [was] over them above."
Ezekiel,10,20,This [is] the living creature that I saw under the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] by the river of K’var [far-off] ; and I knew that they [were] the k’vurim (cherubim).
Ezekiel,10,21,"Every one had four faces apiece, and everyone four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man [was] under their wings."
Ezekiel,10,22,"And the likeness of their faces [was] the same faces which I saw by the river of K’var [far-off] , their appearances and themselves: they went everyone straight forward."
Ezekiel,11,1,"Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] house, which looks eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Ya’azanyahu [Yehovah hears] the son of ‘Azur [he that assists] , and P’latyahu [Yehovah delivers] the son of B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] , princes of the people."
Ezekiel,11,2,"Then said he unto me, Son of man, these [are] the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:"
Ezekiel,11,3,"Which say, [It is] not near; let us build houses: this [city is] the caldron, and we [be] the flesh."
Ezekiel,11,4,"Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O Son of man."
Ezekiel,11,5,"And the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; Thus have you 2f said, O house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : for I know the things that come into your mind, [everyone of] them."
Ezekiel,11,6,"You 2f have multiplied your slain in this city, and you 2f have filled the streets thereof with the slain."
Ezekiel,11,7,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Your slain whom you 2f have laid in the midst of it, they [are] the flesh, and this [city is] the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it."
Ezekiel,11,8,"You 2f have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,11,9,"And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you."
Ezekiel,11,10,You 2f shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
Ezekiel,11,11,"This [city] shall not be your caldron, neither shall you 2f be the flesh in the midst thereof; [but] I will judge you in the border of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]:"
Ezekiel,11,12,"And you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : for you 2f have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that [are] round about you."
Ezekiel,11,13,"And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that P’latyahu [Yehovah delivers] the son of B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ! will you i make a full end of the remnant of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
Ezekiel,11,14,"Again the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,11,15,"Son of man, you i brethren, [even] you i brethren, the men of your i family, and all the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] wholly, [are] they unto whom the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] have said, Get you far from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : unto us is this land given in possession."
Ezekiel,11,16,"Therefore say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come."
Ezekiel,11,17,"Therefore say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where you 2f have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,11,18,"And they shall come there, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from there."
Ezekiel,11,19,"And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:"
Ezekiel,11,20,"That they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ezekiel,11,21,"But [as for them] whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,11,22,"Then did the k’vurim (cherubim) lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [was] over them above."
Ezekiel,11,23,"And the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which [is] on the east side of the city."
Ezekiel,11,24,"Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] into Kasdim [clod-breakers] , to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me."
Ezekiel,11,25,Then I spoke unto them of the captivity all the things that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had showed me.
Ezekiel,12,1,"The word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) also came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,2,"Son of man, you i dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they [are] a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,12,3,"Therefore, you i Son of man, prepare your i stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and you i shall remove from your i place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they [be] a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,12,4,"Then shall you i bring forth your i stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and you i shall go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity."
Ezekiel,12,5,"Dig you i through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby."
Ezekiel,12,6,"In their sight shall you i bear [it] upon [your i ] shoulders, [and] carry [it] forth in the twilight: you i shall cover your i face, that you i see not the ground: for I have set you i [for] a sign unto the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,12,7,"And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I excavated through the wall with my hand; I brought [it] forth in the twilight, [and] I bore [it] upon [my] shoulder in their sight."
Ezekiel,12,8,"And in the morning came the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,9,"Son of man, has not the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , the rebellious house, said unto you i , What do you i?"
Ezekiel,12,10,"Say you i unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; This burden [concern] the prince in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and all the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that [are] among them."
Ezekiel,12,11,"Say, I [am] your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove [and] go into captivity."
Ezekiel,12,12,"And the prince that [is] among them shall bear upon [his] shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to (to do entirely, do wholly) carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with [his] eyes."
Ezekiel,12,13,"My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] [to] the land of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] ; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there."
Ezekiel,12,14,"And I will scatter toward every wind all that [are] about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them."
Ezekiel,12,15,"And they shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries."
Ezekiel,12,16,"But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen to which they come; and they shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,12,17,"Moreover the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,18,"Son of man, eat your i bread with quaking, and drink your i water with trembling and with carefulness;"
Ezekiel,12,19,"And say unto the people of the land, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) of the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace], [and] of the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is in it, because of the violence of all them that dwell in it."
Ezekiel,12,20,"And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,12,21,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,22,"Son of man, what [is] that proverb [that] you 2f have in the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?"
Ezekiel,12,23,"Tell them therefore, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision."
Ezekiel,12,24,For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
Ezekiel,12,25,"For I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,12,26,"Again the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,27,"Son of man, behold, [they of] the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] say, The vision that he sees [is] for many days [to come] , and he prophesies of the times [that are] far off."
Ezekiel,12,28,"Therefore say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,13,1,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,13,2,"Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that prophesy, and say you i unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear you 2f the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate);"
Ezekiel,13,3,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!"
Ezekiel,13,4,"O Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , your i prophets are like the foxes in the deserts."
Ezekiel,13,5,"You 2f have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,13,6,"They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) says: and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has not sent them: and they have made [others] to hope that they would confirm the word."
Ezekiel,13,7,"Have you 2f not seen a vain vision, and have you 2f not spoken a lying divination, whereas you 2f say, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) says [it] ; albeit (although it be that) I have not spoken?"
Ezekiel,13,8,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Because you 2f have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I [am] against you, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,13,9,"And my hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , neither shall they enter into the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,13,10,"Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and [there was] no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered [mortar]:"
Ezekiel,13,11,"Say unto them which daub (to cover or plaster) [it] with untempered [mortar] , that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and you 2f , O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend (tear apart; forcefully rip apart) [it]."
Ezekiel,13,12,"Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where [is] the daubing which you 2f have daubed [it]?"
Ezekiel,13,13,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; I will even rend (tear apart; forcefully rip apart) [it] with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in [my] fury to consume [it]."
Ezekiel,13,14,"So will I break down the wall that you 2f have daubed with untempered [mortar] , and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and you 2f shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,13,15,"Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered [mortar] , and will say unto you, The wall [is] no [more] , neither they that daubed it;"
Ezekiel,13,16," [To wit] , the prophets of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] which prophesy concerning Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and which see visions of peace for her, and [there is] no peace, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,13,17,"Likewise, you i Son of man, set your i face against the daughters of your i people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy you i against them,"
Ezekiel,13,18,"And say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Woe to the [women] that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will you 2f hunt the souls of my people, and will you 2f save the souls alive [that come] unto you?"
Ezekiel,13,19,"And will you 2f pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear [your] lies?"
Ezekiel,13,20,"For what reason thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I [am] against your pillows, which you 2f there hunt the souls to make [them] fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, [even] the souls that you 2f hunt to make [them] fly."
Ezekiel,13,21,"Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,13,22,"Because with lies you 2f have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:"
Ezekiel,13,23,"Therefore you 2f shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,14,1,"Then came certain of the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] unto me, and sat before me."
Ezekiel,14,2,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,14,3,"Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them?"
Ezekiel,14,4,"Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Every man of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will answer him that comes according to the multitude of his idols;"
Ezekiel,14,5,"That I may take the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols."
Ezekiel,14,6,"Therefore say unto the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Repent, and turn [yourselves] from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations."
Ezekiel,14,7,"For every one of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , or of the stranger that sojourns in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which separates himself from me, and sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and comes to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will answer him by myself:"
Ezekiel,14,8,"And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,14,9,"And if the prophet be deceived when he has spoken a thing, I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,14,10,And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeks [unto him];
Ezekiel,14,11,"That the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,14,12,"The word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came again to me, saying,"
Ezekiel,14,13,"Son of man, when the land sins against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out my hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:"
Ezekiel,14,14,"Though these three men, Noach [rest] , Dani’el [God is Judge] , and Job, were in it, they should deliver [but] their own souls by their righteousness, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,14,15,"If I cause destructive (hurtful; noxious) beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil (plunder; prey; booty) it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:"
Ezekiel,14,16," [Though] these three men [were] in it, [as] I live, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate."
Ezekiel,14,17,"Or [if] I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:"
Ezekiel,14,18,"Though these three men [were] in it, [as] I live, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves."
Ezekiel,14,19,"Or [if] I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:"
Ezekiel,14,20,"Though No’ah [Motion] , Dani’el [God is Judge] , and Job, [were] in it, [as] I live, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall [but] deliver their own souls by their righteousness."
Ezekiel,14,21,"For thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , the sword, and the famine, and the destructive (hurtful; noxious) beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?"
Ezekiel,14,22,"Yet, behold, in it shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, [both] sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and you 2f shall see their way and their doings: and you 2f shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace], [even] concerning all that I have brought upon it."
Ezekiel,14,23,"And they shall comfort you, when you 2f see their ways and their doings: and you 2f shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,15,1,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,15,2,"Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, [or than] a branch which is among the trees of the forest?"
Ezekiel,15,3,Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will [men] take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
Ezekiel,15,4,"Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for [any] work?"
Ezekiel,15,5,"Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for [any] work, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned?"
Ezekiel,15,6,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Ezekiel,15,7,"And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from [one] fire, and [another] fire shall devour them; and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , when I set my face against them."
Ezekiel,15,8,"And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,16,1,"Again the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,16,2,"Son of man, cause Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to know her abominations,"
Ezekiel,16,3,"And say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; You 1s birth and you i nativity [is] of the land of Kena’an [Merchant] ; you i father [was] an Emori [Rebellious Highlanders] , and you i mother an Hitti [Terrorists]."
Ezekiel,16,4,"And [as for] your i nativity, in the day you i were born your i navel was not cut, neither were you i washed in water to supple [you i ] ; you i were not salted at all, nor swaddled at all."
Ezekiel,16,5,"None eye pitied you i , to do any of these unto you i , to have compassion upon you i ; but you i were cast out in the open field, to the loathing of you i person, in the day that you i were born."
Ezekiel,16,6,"And when I passed by you i , and saw you i polluted in your i own blood, I said unto you i [when you i were] in your i blood, Live; yes, I said unto you i [when you i were] in your i blood, Live."
Ezekiel,16,7,"I have caused you i to multiply as the bud of the field, and you i have increased and waxen great, and you i are come to excellent ornaments: [your i ] breasts are fashioned, and your i hair is grown, whereas you i [were] naked and bare."
Ezekiel,16,8,"Now when I passed by you i , and looked upon you i , behold, your i time [was] the time of love; and I spread my skirt over you i , and covered your i nakedness: yes, I swore unto you i , and entered into a covenant with you i , says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , and you i became mine."
Ezekiel,16,9,"Then washed I you i with water; yes, I thoroughly washed away your i blood from you i , and I anointed you i with oil."
Ezekiel,16,10,"I clothed you i also with adorned with needlework work, and shod you i with badgers’ skin, and I girded you i about with fine linen, and I covered you i with silk."
Ezekiel,16,11,"I decked you i also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon your i hands, and a chain on your i neck."
Ezekiel,16,12,"And I put a jewel on your i forehead, and earrings in your i ears, and a beautiful crown upon your i head."
Ezekiel,16,13,"Thus were you i decked with gold and silver; and your i clothing [was of] fine linen, and silk, and adorned with needlework work; you i did eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and you i were exceeding beautiful, and you i did prosper into a kingdom."
Ezekiel,16,14,"And your i renown (great reputation; being well-known) went forth among the heathen for your i beauty: for it [was] perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon you i , says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,16,15,"But you i did trust in your i own beauty, and played the prostitute because of your i renown (great reputation; being well-known), and poured out your i fornications on everyone that passed by; his it was."
Ezekiel,16,16,"And of your i garments you i did take, and decked you i high places with diverse colours, and played the prostitute thereupon: [the like things] shall not come, neither shall it be [so]."
Ezekiel,16,17,"You i have also taken your i fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you i , and made to yourself images of men, and did commit whoredom with them,"
Ezekiel,16,18,"And took your i embroidered garments, and covered them: and you i have set my oil and my incense before them."
Ezekiel,16,19,"My meat also which I gave you i , fine flour, and oil, and honey, [which] I fed you i , you i have even set it before them for a soothing aroma: and [thus] it was, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,16,20,"Moreover you i have taken your i sons and your i daughters, whom you i have borne unto me, and these have you i sacrificed unto them to be devoured. [Is this] of your i cult prostitution a small matter,"
Ezekiel,16,21,"That you i have slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through [the fire] for them?"
Ezekiel,16,22,"And in all your i abominations and your i cult prostitution you i have not remembered the days of your i youth, when you i were naked and bare, [and] were polluted in your i blood."
Ezekiel,16,23,"And it came to pass after all your i wickedness, (woe, woe unto you i ! says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ;)"
Ezekiel,16,24," [That] you i have also built unto you i an eminent place, and have made you i an high place in every street."
Ezekiel,16,25,"You i have built your i high place at every head of the way, and have made your i beauty to be abhorred, and have opened your i legs to everyone that passed by, and multiplied your i cult prostitution."
Ezekiel,16,26,"You i have also committed fornication with the Mitzri your i neighbours, great of flesh; and have increased your i cult prostitution, to provoke me to anger."
Ezekiel,16,27,"Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over you i , and have diminished your i ordinary [food] , and delivered you i unto the will of them that hate you i , the daughters of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , which are ashamed of your i lewd way."
Ezekiel,16,28,"You i have played the whore also with the children of Ashur, because you i were insatiable; yes, you i have played the prostitute with them, and yet could not be satisfied."
Ezekiel,16,29,You i have moreover multiplied your i fornication in the land of Kena’an [Merchant] unto Kasdim [clod-breakers] ; and yet you i were not satisfied with this!
Ezekiel,16,30,"How weak is your i heart, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , seeing you i do all these [things] , the work of an shameless whorish woman;"
Ezekiel,16,31,"In that you i build your i eminent place in the head of every way, and makes your i high place in every street; and have not been as an prostitute, in that you i scorn getting paid;"
Ezekiel,16,32," [But as] a wife that commits adultery, [which] takes strangers instead of her husband!"
Ezekiel,16,33,"They give gifts to all whores: but you i give your i gifts to all your i lovers, and hire them, that they may come unto you i on every side for your i whoredom."
Ezekiel,16,34,"And the contrary is in you i from [other] women in your i cult prostitution, whereas none follows you i to commit cult prostitution: and in that you i give a reward, and no reward is given unto you i , therefore you i are contrary."
Ezekiel,16,35,"For this reason, O prostitute, hear the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):"
Ezekiel,16,36,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Because you i filthiness was poured out, and your i nakedness discovered through your i cult prostitution with your i lovers, and with all the idols of your i abominations, and by the blood of your i children, which you i did give unto them;"
Ezekiel,16,37,"Behold, therefore I will gather all your i lovers, with whom you i have taken pleasure, and all [them] that you i have loved, with all [them] that you i have hated; I will even gather them roundabout against you i , and will expose your i nakedness unto them, that they may see all your i nakedness."
Ezekiel,16,38,"And I will judge you i , as women that breaks wedlock and sheds blood are judged; and I will give you i blood in fury and jealousy."
Ezekiel,16,39,"And I will also give you i into their hand, and they shall throw down your i eminent place, and shall break down your i high places: they shall strip you i also of your i clothes, and shall take your i fair jewels, and leave your i naked and bare."
Ezekiel,16,40,"They shall also bring up a company against you i , and they shall stone you i with stones, and thrust you i through with their swords."
Ezekiel,16,41,"And they shall burn your i houses with fire, and execute judgments upon you i in the sight of many women: and I will cause you i to cease from playing the prostitute, and you i also shall give no pay (to your lovers) any more."
Ezekiel,16,42,"So will I make my fury toward you i to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from you i , and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry."
Ezekiel,16,43,"Because you i have not remembered the days of your i youth, but have fretted me in all these [things] ; behold, therefore I also will recompense your i way upon [you i ] head, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) : and you i shall not commit this lewdness above all your i abominations."
Ezekiel,16,44,"Behold, everyone that uses proverbs shall use [this] proverb against you i , saying, As [is] the mother, [so is] her daughter."
Ezekiel,16,45,"You i [are] your i mother’s daughter, that loathes her husband and her children; and you i [are] the sister of your i sisters, which loathed their husbands and their children: your mother [was] an Hitti [Terrorists] , and your father an Emori [Rebellious Highlanders]."
Ezekiel,16,46,"And your i elder sister [is] Shomron [watch mountain] , she and her daughters that dwell at your i left hand: and your i younger sister, that dwells at your i right hand, [is] S’dom [Burning] and her daughters."
Ezekiel,16,47,"Yet have you i not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as [if that were] a very little [thing] , you i were corrupted more than they in all your i ways!"
Ezekiel,16,48," [As] I live, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , S’dom [Burning] your i sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as you i have done, you i and your i daughters."
Ezekiel,16,49,"Behold, this was the iniquity of your i sister S’dom [Burning] , pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy."
Ezekiel,16,50,"And they were arrogant (proud; lifted up) , and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw [good]."
Ezekiel,16,51,"Neither has Shomron [watch mountain] committed half of your i sins; but you i have multiplied your i abominations more than they, and have justified your i sisters in all your i abominations which you i have done."
Ezekiel,16,52,"You i also, which have judged your i sisters, bear your i own shame for your i sins that you i have committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than you i : yes, be you i confounded also, and bear your i shame, in that you i have justified your i sisters."
Ezekiel,16,53,"When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of S’dom [Burning] and her daughters, and the captivity of Shomron [watch mountain] and her daughters, then [will I bring again] the captivity of your i captives in the midst of them:"
Ezekiel,16,54,"That you i may bear your i own shame, and may be confounded in all that you i have done, in that you i are a comfort unto them."
Ezekiel,16,55,"When your i sisters, S’dom [Burning] and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Shomron [watch mountain] and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then you i and your i daughters shall return to your former estate."
Ezekiel,16,56,"For your i sister S’dom [Burning] was not mentioned by your i mouth in the day of your i pride,"
Ezekiel,16,57,"Before your i wickedness was discovered, as at the time of [your i ] reproach (disgrace; shame) of the daughters of Aram (Syria) [exalted] , and all [that are] round about her, the daughters of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , which despise you i round about."
Ezekiel,16,58,"You i have borne your i lewdness and your i abominations, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,16,59,"For thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; I will even deal with you i as you i have done, which have despised the oath in breaking the Covenant."
Ezekiel,16,60,"Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you i in the days of your i youth, and I will establish unto you i an everlasting covenant."
Ezekiel,16,61,"Then you i shall remember your i ways, and be ashamed, when you i shall receive your i sisters, your i elder and your i younger: and I will give them unto you i for daughters, but not by your i covenant."
Ezekiel,16,62,And I will establish my covenant with you i ; and you i shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):
Ezekiel,16,63,"That you i may remember, and be confounded, and never open your i mouth anymore because of your i shame, when I am pacified toward you i for all that you i have done, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,17,1,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,17,2,"Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God];"
Ezekiel,17,3,"And say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had diverse colours, came unto L’vanon [Whiteness] , and took the highest branch of the cedar:"
Ezekiel,17,4,"He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick (trade; do business) ; he set it in a city of merchants."
Ezekiel,17,5,"He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed [it] by great waters, [and] set it [as] a willow tree."
Ezekiel,17,6,"And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs."
Ezekiel,17,7,"There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation."
Ezekiel,17,8,"It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine."
Ezekiel,17,9,"Say you i , Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof."
Ezekiel,17,10,"Yes, behold, [being] planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind touches it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew."
Ezekiel,17,11,"Moreover the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,17,12,"Say now to the rebellious house, Know you 2f not what these [things mean] ? tell [them] , Behold, the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] is come to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and has taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion];"
Ezekiel,17,13,"And has taken of the king’s seed, and made a covenant with him, and has taken an oath of him: he has also taken the mighty of the land:"
Ezekiel,17,14,"That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, [but] that by keeping of his covenant it might stand."
Ezekiel,17,15,"But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that does such [things] ? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?"
Ezekiel,17,16," [As] I live, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , surely in the place [where] the king [dwells] that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, [even] with him in the midst of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] he shall die."
Ezekiel,17,17,"Neither shall Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] with [his] mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:"
Ezekiel,17,18,"Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and has done all these [things] , he shall not escape."
Ezekiel,17,19,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER); [As] I live, surely my oath that he has despised, and my covenant that he has broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head."
Ezekiel,17,20,"And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and will plead with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me."
Ezekiel,17,21,"And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and you 2f shall know that I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have spoken [it]."
Ezekiel,17,22,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set [it] ; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant [it] upon an high mountain and eminent:"
Ezekiel,17,23,"In the mountain of the height of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell."
Ezekiel,17,24,"And all the trees of the field shall know that I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have spoken and have done [it]."
Ezekiel,18,1,"The word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me again, saying,"
Ezekiel,18,2,"What mean you 2f , that you 2f use this proverb concerning the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge?"
Ezekiel,18,3," [As] I live, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , you 2f shall not have [occasion] any more to use this proverb in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,18,4,"Behold, all souls are my; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is my: the soul that sins, it shall die."
Ezekiel,18,5,"But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,"
Ezekiel,18,6," [And] has not eaten upon the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , neither has defiled his neighbour’s wife, neither has come near to a monstrous woman,"
Ezekiel,18,7,"And has not oppressed any, [but] has restored to the debtor his pledge, has spoiled none by violence, has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;"
Ezekiel,18,8,"He [that] has not given forth upon usury (interest paid for using money) , neither has taken any increase, [that] has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, has executed true judgment between man and man,"
Ezekiel,18,9,"Has walked in my statutes, and has kept my judgments, to deal truly; he [is] just, he shall surely live, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,18,10,"If he beget (to be father of; be ancestor of) a son [that is] a robber, a shedder of blood, and [that] does the like to [any] one of these [things],"
Ezekiel,18,11,"And that does not any of those [duties] , but even has eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour’s wife,"
Ezekiel,18,12,"Has oppressed the poor and needy, has spoiled by violence, has not restored the pledge, and has lifted up his eyes to the idols, has committed abomination,"
Ezekiel,18,13,"Has given forth upon usury (interest paid for using money) , and has taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him."
Ezekiel,18,14,"Now, lo, [if] he beget (to be father of; be ancestor of) a son, that sees all his father’s sins which he has done, and considers, and does not such like,"
Ezekiel,18,15," [That] has not eaten upon the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , has not defiled his neighbour’s wife,"
Ezekiel,18,16,"Neither has oppressed any, has not withheld the pledge, neither has spoiled by violence, [but] has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment,"
Ezekiel,18,17," [That] has taken off his hand from the poor, [that] has not received usury (interest paid for using money) nor increase, has executed my judgments, has walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live."
Ezekiel,18,18," [As for] his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did [that] which [is] not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity."
Ezekiel,18,19,"Yet say you 2f , Why? does not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and right, [and] has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live."
Ezekiel,18,20,"The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him."
Ezekiel,18,21,"But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die."
Ezekiel,18,22,"All his transgressions that he has committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he has done he shall live."
Ezekiel,18,23,"Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER): [and] not that he should return from his ways, and live?"
Ezekiel,18,24,"But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, [and] does according to all the abominations that the wicked [man] does, shall he live? All his righteousness that he has done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them shall he die."
Ezekiel,18,25,"Yet you 2f say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?"
Ezekiel,18,26,"When a righteous [man] turns away from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and dies in them; for his iniquity that he has done shall he die."
Ezekiel,18,27,"Again, when the wicked [man] turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive."
Ezekiel,18,28,"Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die."
Ezekiel,18,29,"Yet says the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?"
Ezekiel,18,30,"Therefore I will judge you, O house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , everyone according to his ways, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) . Repent, and turn [yourselves] from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin."
Ezekiel,18,31,"Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby you 2f have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will you 2f die, O house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
Ezekiel,18,32,"For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) : wherefore turn [yourselves] , and live you 2f."
Ezekiel,19,1,"Moreover take you i up a lamentation for the princes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God],"
Ezekiel,19,2,"And say, What [is] your i mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions."
Ezekiel,19,3,"And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men."
Ezekiel,19,4,"The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
Ezekiel,19,5,"Now when she saw that she had waited, [and] her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, [and] made him a young lion."
Ezekiel,19,6,"And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, [and] devoured men."
Ezekiel,19,7,"And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fullness thereof, by the noise of his roaring."
Ezekiel,19,8,"Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit."
Ezekiel,19,9,"And they put him in ward (in custody, with a guard; prison) in chains, and brought him to the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] : they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,19,10,"Your 1s mother [is] like a vine in your i blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters."
Ezekiel,19,11,"And she had strong rods for the scepters of them that bore rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches."
Ezekiel,19,12,"But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them."
Ezekiel,19,13,"And now she [is] planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground."
Ezekiel,19,14,"And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, [which] has devoured her fruit, so that she has no strong rod [to be] a scepter to rule. This [is] a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation."
Ezekiel,20,1,"And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth [month] , the tenth [day] of the month, [that] certain of the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came to enquire of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and sat before me."
Ezekiel,20,2,"Then came the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,20,3,"Son of man, speak unto the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Are you 2f come to enquire of me? [As] I live, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , I will not be enquired of by you."
Ezekiel,20,4,"Will you i judge them, Son of man, will you i judge [them] ? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:"
Ezekiel,20,5,"And say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; In the day when I chose Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and lifted up my hand unto the seed of the house of Ya’akov [Heal of God] , and made myself known unto them in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , when I lifted up my hand unto them, saying, I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered];"
Ezekiel,20,6,"In the day [that] I lifted up my hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] into a land that I had discovered (spied out; examined) for them, flowing with milk and honey, which [is] the glory of all lands:"
Ezekiel,20,7,"Then said I unto them, Cast you 2f away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ezekiel,20,8,"But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
Ezekiel,20,9,"But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they [were] , in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
Ezekiel,20,10,"For what reason I caused them to go forth out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and brought them into the wilderness."
Ezekiel,20,11,"And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, which [if] a man do, he shall even live in them."
Ezekiel,20,12,"Moreover also I gave them my Shabbat, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) that sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) them."
Ezekiel,20,13,"But the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which [if] a man do, he shall even live in them; and my Shabbat they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them."
Ezekiel,20,14,"But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out."
Ezekiel,20,15,"Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given [them] , flowing with milk and honey, which [is] the glory of all lands;"
Ezekiel,20,16,"Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my Shabbat: for their heart went after their idols."
Ezekiel,20,17,"Nevertheless my eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness."
Ezekiel,20,18,"But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk you 2f not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:"
Ezekiel,20,19,"I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;"
Ezekiel,20,20,"And hallow (to approve, commend, accept) my Shabbat; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that you 2f may know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ezekiel,20,21,"Yet the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which [if] a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my Shabbat: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness."
Ezekiel,20,22,"Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth."
Ezekiel,20,23,"I lifted up my hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;"
Ezekiel,20,24,"Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my Shabbat, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols."
Ezekiel,20,25,"Wherefore I permitted them, or gave them over to, [false] statutes that are not good, and judgments whereby they should not live.;"
Ezekiel,20,26,"And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through [the fire] all that opens the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,20,27,"Therefore, Son of man, speak unto the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me."
Ezekiel,20,28," [For] when I had brought them into the land, [for] the which I lifted up my hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their soothing aroma, and poured out there their drink offerings."
Ezekiel,20,29,"Then I said unto them, What [is] the high place whereunto you 2f go? And the name thereof is called Bamah [high place] unto this day."
Ezekiel,20,30,"For what reason say unto the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Are you 2f polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit you 2f whoredom after their abominations?"
Ezekiel,20,31,"For when you 2f offer your gifts, when you 2f make your sons to pass through the fire, you 2f pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]? [As] I live, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , I will not be enquired of by you."
Ezekiel,20,32,"And that which comes into your mind shall not be at all, that you 2f say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone."
Ezekiel,20,33," [As] I live, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:"
Ezekiel,20,34,"And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein you 2f are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out."
Ezekiel,20,35,"And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face."
Ezekiel,20,36,"Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , so will I plead with you, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,20,37,"And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:"
Ezekiel,20,38,"And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,20,39,"As for you, O house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Go you 2f , serve you 2f everyone his idols, and hereafter [also] , if you 2f will not hearken unto me: but pollute you 2f my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols."
Ezekiel,20,40,"For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , there shall all the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things."
Ezekiel,20,41,"I will accept you with your soothing aroma, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein you 2f have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen."
Ezekiel,20,42,"And you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , when I shall bring you into the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , into the country [for] the which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers."
Ezekiel,20,43,"And there shall you 2f remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein you 2f have been defiled; and you 2f shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you 2f have committed."
Ezekiel,20,44,"And you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , when I have wrought with you for my name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O you 2f house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,20,45,"Moreover the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,20,46,"Son of man, set you i face toward the south, and drop [you i word] toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;"
Ezekiel,20,47,"And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I will kindle a fire in you i , and it shall devour every green tree in you i , and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned in it."
Ezekiel,20,48,And all flesh shall see that I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.
Ezekiel,20,49,"Then said I, Ah Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ! they say of me, Does he not speak parables?"
Ezekiel,21,1,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,21,2,"Son of man, set your i face toward Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and drop [you i word] toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God],"
Ezekiel,21,3,"And say to the and of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; Behold, I [am] against you i , and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from you i the righteous and the wicked."
Ezekiel,21,4,"Seeing then that I will cut off from you i the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:"
Ezekiel,21,5,That all flesh may know that I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.
Ezekiel,21,6,"Sigh therefore, you i Son of man, with the breaking of [your i ] waist; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes."
Ezekiel,21,7,"And it shall be, when they say unto you i , For what reason sigh you i ? that you i shall answer, For the tidings; because it comes: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak [as] water: behold, it comes, and shall be brought to pass, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,21,8,"Again the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,21,9,"Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All Things] ; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:"
Ezekiel,21,10,"It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make gladness? it scorns the rod of my son, [as] every tree."
Ezekiel,21,11,"And he has given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer."
Ezekiel,21,12,"Cry and howl, Son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it [shall be] upon all the princes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: strike therefore upon [you i ] thigh."
Ezekiel,21,13,"Because [it is] a trial, and what if [the sword] contemn (despise with mockery; show contempt) even the rod? it shall be no [more] , says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,21,14,"You i therefore, Son of man, prophesy, and strike [your i ] hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it [is] the sword of the great [men that are] slain, which enters into their private chambers."
Ezekiel,21,15,"I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that [their] heart may faint, and [their] ruins be multiplied: ah! [it is] made bright, [it is] wrapped up for the slaughter."
Ezekiel,21,16,"Go you i one way or other, [either] on the right hand, [or] on the left, to wherever your i face [is] set."
Ezekiel,21,17,"I will also strike my hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have said [it]."
Ezekiel,21,18,"The word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me again, saying,"
Ezekiel,21,19,"Also, you i Son of man, appoint you i two ways, that the sword of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] may come: both two shall come forth out of one land: and choose you i a place, choose [it] at the head of the way to the city."
Ezekiel,21,20,"Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbah [Great] [Great] of the ‘Amon [Inbred] , and to Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] the fortified."
Ezekiel,21,21,"For the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made [his] arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver."
Ezekiel,21,22,"At his right hand was the divination for Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint [battering] rams against the gates, to cast a mount, [and] to build a fort."
Ezekiel,21,23,"And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to (to do entirely, do wholly) remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken."
Ezekiel,21,24,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Because you 2f have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, [I say] , that you 2f are come to remembrance, you 2f shall be taken with the hand."
Ezekiel,21,25,"And you i , Profane (treat as common; defile) wicked prince of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , whose day is come, when iniquity [shall have] an end,"
Ezekiel,21,26,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Remove the Diadem (royal headband worn by Eastern kings) , and take off the crown: this [shall] not [be] the same: exalt [him that is] low, and abase [him that is] high."
Ezekiel,21,27,"I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no [more] , until he come whose right it is; and I will give it [him]."
Ezekiel,21,28,"And you i , Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) concerning the ‘Amon [Inbred] , and concerning their reproach (disgrace; shame) ; even say you i , The sword, the sword [is] drawn: for the slaughter [it is] furbished, to consume because of the glittering:"
Ezekiel,21,29,"Whiles they see vanity unto you i , whiles they divine a lie unto you i , to bring you i upon the necks of [them that are] slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity [shall have] an end."
Ezekiel,21,30,"Shall I cause [it] to return into his sheath? I will judge you i in the place where you i were created, in the land of your i nativity."
Ezekiel,21,31,"And I will pour out my indignation upon you i , I will blow against you i in the fire of my wrath, and deliver you i into the hand of cruel men, [and] skillful to destroy."
Ezekiel,21,32,You i shall be for fuel to the fire; your i blood shall be in the midst of the land; you i shall be no [more] remembered: for I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have spoken [it].
Ezekiel,22,1,"Moreover the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,22,2,"Now, you i Son of man, will you i judge, will you i judge the bloody city? yes, you i shall show her all her abominations."
Ezekiel,22,3,"Then say you i , Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , The city sheds blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and makes idols against herself to defile herself."
Ezekiel,22,4,"You i are become guilty in your i blood that you i have shed; and have defiled yourself in your i idols which you i have made; and you i have caused your i days to draw near, and are come [even] unto your i years: therefore have I made you i a reproach (disgrace; shame) unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries."
Ezekiel,22,5," [Those that be] near, and [those that be] far from you i , shall mock you i, [which are] infamous [and] much vexed."
Ezekiel,22,6,"Behold, the princes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , everyone were in you i to their power to shed blood."
Ezekiel,22,7,In you i have they make light of father and mother: in the midst of you i have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in you i have they wronged the fatherless and the widow.
Ezekiel,22,8,"You i have despised my holy things, and have profaned my Shabbat."
Ezekiel,22,9,In you i are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in you i they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of you i they commit lewdness.
Ezekiel,22,10,In you i have they discovered their fathers’ nakedness: in you i have they forced her that was set apart for pollution (her menstrual cycle).
Ezekiel,22,11,"And one has committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in you i has humbled his sister, his father’s daughter."
Ezekiel,22,12,"In you i have they taken gifts to shed blood; you i have taken usury (interest paid for using money) and increase, and you i have greedily gained of your i neighbours by extortion, and have forgotten me, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,22,13,"Behold, therefore I have smitten my hand at your i dishonest gain which you i have made, and at your i blood which has been in the midst of you i."
Ezekiel,22,14,"Can your i heart endure, or can your i hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with you i ? I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have spoken [it] , and will do [it]."
Ezekiel,22,15,"And I will scatter you i among the heathen, and disperse you i in the countries, and will consume your i filthiness out of you i."
Ezekiel,22,16,"And you i shall take your i inheritance in yourself in the sight of the heathen, and you i shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,22,17,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,22,18,"Son of man, the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] is to me become dross: all they [are] brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are [even] the dross of silver."
Ezekiel,22,19,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Because you 2f are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Ezekiel,22,20," [As] they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt [it] ; so will I gather [you] in my anger and in my fury, and I will leave [you there] , and melt you."
Ezekiel,22,21,"Yes, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and you 2f shall be melted in the midst thereof."
Ezekiel,22,22,"As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall you 2f be melted in the midst thereof; and you 2f shall know that I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have poured out my fury upon you."
Ezekiel,22,23,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,22,24,"Son of man, say unto her, you i [are] the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation."
Ezekiel,22,25," [There is] a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening (preying upon to devour) the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof."
Ezekiel,22,26,"Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and Profane (treat as common; defile) , neither have they showed [difference] between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my Shabbat, and I am profaned among them."
Ezekiel,22,27,"Her princes in the midst thereof [are] like wolves ravening (preying upon to devour) the prey, to shed blood, [and] to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain."
Ezekiel,22,28,"And her prophets have daubed them with untempered [mortar] , seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has not spoken."
Ezekiel,22,29,"The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yes, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully."
Ezekiel,22,30,"And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none."
Ezekiel,22,31,"Therefore have I poured out my indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,23,1,"The word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came again unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,23,2,"Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:"
Ezekiel,23,3,"And they committed cult prostitution in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ; they committed cult prostitution in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the nipples of their virginity."
Ezekiel,23,4,"And the names of them [were] Oholah [her own tent] the elder, and Oholivah [woman of the tent] her sister: and they were my, and they bore sons and daughters. Thus [were] their names; Shomron [watch mountain] [is] Oholah [her own tent] , and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] Oholivah [woman of the tent]."
Ezekiel,23,5,"And Oholah [her own tent] played the prostitute when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the children of Ashur [her] neighbours,"
Ezekiel,23,6," [Which were] clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses."
Ezekiel,23,7,"Thus she committed her cult prostitution with them, with all them [that were] the chosen men of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself."
Ezekiel,23,8,"Neither left she her cult prostitution [brought] from Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their lust (fornication) upon her."
Ezekiel,23,9,"For what reason I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the children of Ashur, upon whom she doted."
Ezekiel,23,10,"These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and killed her with the sword: and she became notorious among women; for they had executed judgment upon her."
Ezekiel,23,11,"And when her sister Oholivah [woman of the tent] saw [this] , she was more corrupt in her inordinate (unrestrained; immoderate) love than she, and in her cult prostitution more than her sister in [her] cult prostitution."
Ezekiel,23,12,"She doted upon the children of Ashur [her] neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men."
Ezekiel,23,13,"Then I saw that she was defiled, [that] they [took] both one way,"
Ezekiel,23,14,"And [that] she increased her cult prostitution: for when she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] portrayed with vermilion,"
Ezekiel,23,15,"Girded with girdles upon their waist, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Bavlim [confusion (my mixing)] of Kasdim [clod-breakers] , the land of their nativity:"
Ezekiel,23,16,"And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Kasdim [clod-breakers]."
Ezekiel,23,17,"And the Bavlim [confusion (my mixing)] came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their lust, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them."
Ezekiel,23,18,"So she discovered her cult prostitution, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister."
Ezekiel,23,19,"Yet she multiplied her cult prostitution, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the prostitute in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
Ezekiel,23,20,"For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh [is as] the flesh of asses, and whose issue (what comes forth) [is like] the issue (what comes forth) of horses."
Ezekiel,23,21,"Thus you i longed for the lewdness of your i youth, in fondling youti nipples by the Mitzri for the breasts of your i youth."
Ezekiel,23,22,"Therefore, O Oholivah [woman of the tent] , thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I will raise up your i lovers against you i , from whom your i mind is alienated, and I will bring them against you i on every side;"
Ezekiel,23,23,"The children of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity), and all the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , P’kod [visitation] , and Shoa [rich] , and Koa [he-camel], [and] all the children of Ashur with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses."
Ezekiel,23,24,"And they shall come against you i with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, [which] shall set against your i buckler (round shielf held with a grip) and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge you i according to their judgments."
Ezekiel,23,25,"And I will set my jealousy against you i , and they shall deal furiously with you i : they shall take away your i nose and your i ears; and your i remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take your i sons and your i daughters; and your i residue (part that remains, the rest) shall be devoured by the fire."
Ezekiel,23,26,"They shall also strip you i out of your i clothes, and take away your i fair jewels."
Ezekiel,23,27,"Thus will I make your i lewdness to cease from you i , and your i whoredom [brought] from the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : so that you i shall not lift up your i eyes unto them, nor remember Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] any more."
Ezekiel,23,28,"For thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I will deliver you i into the hand [of them] whom you i hate, into the hand [of them] from whom your i mind is alienated:"
Ezekiel,23,29,"And they shall deal with you i hatefully, and shall take away all your i labour, and shall leave you i naked and bare: and the nakedness of your i cult prostitution shall be discovered, both your i lewdness and your i cult prostitution."
Ezekiel,23,30,"I will do these [things] unto you i , because you i have gone a whoring after the heathen, [and] because you i are polluted with their idols."
Ezekiel,23,31,You i have walked in the way of your i sister; therefore will I give her cup into your i hand.
Ezekiel,23,32,Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; you i shall drink of your i sister’s cup deep and large: you i shall be laughed to scorn and had in ridicule (laughing at enemies’ threats) ; it contains much.
Ezekiel,23,33,"you i shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of your i sister Shomron [watch mountain]."
Ezekiel,23,34,"you i shall even drink it and suck [it] out, and you i shall break the shards thereof, and pluck off your i own breasts: for I have spoken [it] , says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,23,35,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Because you i have forgotten me, and cast me behind your i back, therefore bear you i also your i lewdness and your i cult prostitution."
Ezekiel,23,36,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said moreover unto me; Son of man, will you i judge Oholah [her own tent] and Oholivah [woman of the tent] ? yes, declare unto them their abominations;"
Ezekiel,23,37,"That they have committed adultery, and blood [is] in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bore unto me, to pass for them through [the fire] , to devour [them]."
Ezekiel,23,38,"Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my Sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Shabbat."
Ezekiel,23,39,"For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to Profane (treat as common; defile) it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of my house."
Ezekiel,23,40,"And furthermore, that you 2f have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger [was] sent; and, lo, they came: for whom you i did wash yourself, painted your i eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments,"
Ezekiel,23,41,"And sat upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon you i have set my incense and my oil."
Ezekiel,23,42,"And a voice of a multitude being at ease [was] with her: and with the men of the common sort [were] brought S’va [drunkards] from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads."
Ezekiel,23,43,"Then said I unto [her that was] old in adulteries, Will they now commit cult prostitution with her, and she [with them]?"
Ezekiel,23,44,"Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that plays the prostitute: so went they in unto Oholah [her own tent] and unto Oholivah [woman of the tent] , the lewd women."
Ezekiel,23,45,"And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they [are] adulteresses, and blood [is] in their hands."
Ezekiel,23,46,"For thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled."
Ezekiel,23,47,"And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire."
Ezekiel,23,48,"Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness."
Ezekiel,23,49,"And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and you 2f shall bear the sins of your idols: and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,24,1,"Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,24,2,"Son of man, write you i the name of the day, [even] of this same day: the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] set himself against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] this same day."
Ezekiel,24,3,"And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Set on a pot, set [it] on, and also pour water into it:"
Ezekiel,24,4,"Gather the pieces thereof into it, [even] every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill [it] with the choice bones."
Ezekiel,24,5,"Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, [and] make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it in it."
Ezekiel,24,6,"For what reason thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum [is] in it, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it."
Ezekiel,24,7,"For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;"
Ezekiel,24,8,"That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered."
Ezekiel,24,9,Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.
Ezekiel,24,10,"Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned."
Ezekiel,24,11,"Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and [that] the filthiness of it may be molten in it, [that] the scum of it may be consumed."
Ezekiel,24,12,"She has wearied [herself] with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum [shall be] in the fire."
Ezekiel,24,13,"In your i filthiness [is] lewdness: because I have purged you i , and you i were not purged, you i shall not be purged from your i filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon you i."
Ezekiel,24,14,"I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have spoken [it] : it shall come to pass, and I will do [it] ; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to your i ways, and according to your i doings, shall they judge you i , says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,24,15,"Also the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,24,16,"Son of man, behold, I take away from you i the desire of your i eyes with a stroke: yet neither shall you i mourn nor weep, neither shall your i tears run down."
Ezekiel,24,17,"Refrain (restrain; refrein from acting) to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of your i head upon you i , and put on your i shoes upon your i feet, and cover not [your i ] lips, and eat not the bread of men."
Ezekiel,24,18,So I spoke unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
Ezekiel,24,19,"And the people said unto me, Will you i not tell us what these [things are] to us, that you i do [so]?"
Ezekiel,24,20,"Then I answered them, The word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,24,21,"Speak unto the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I will Profane (treat as common; defile) my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you 2f have left shall fall by the sword."
Ezekiel,24,22,"And you 2f shall do as I have done: you 2f shall not cover [your] lips, nor eat the bread of men."
Ezekiel,24,23,"And your tires [shall be] upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: you 2f shall not mourn nor weep; but you 2f shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another."
Ezekiel,24,24,"Thus Yechezk’el [God strengthens] is unto you a sign: according to all that he has done shall you 2f do: and when this comes, you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,24,25,"Also, you i Son of man, [shall it] not [be] in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,"
Ezekiel,24,26," [That] he that escapes in that day shall come unto you i , to cause [you i ] to hear [it] with [your i ] ears?"
Ezekiel,24,27,"In that day shall your i mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and you i shall speak, and be no more dumb: and you i shall be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,25,1,"The word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came again unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,25,2,"Son of man, set your i face against the ‘Amon [Inbred] , and prophesy against them;"
Ezekiel,25,3,"And say unto the ‘Amon [Inbred] , Hear the word of the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Because you i said, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , when it was desolate; and against the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , when they went into captivity;"
Ezekiel,25,4,"Behold, therefore I will deliver you i to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in you i , and make their dwellings in you i : they shall eat your i fruit, and they shall drink your i milk."
Ezekiel,25,5,"And I will make Rabbah [Great] a stable for camels, and the ‘Amon [Inbred] a couchingplace for flocks: and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,25,6,"For thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Because you i have clapped [your i ] hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all your i despite (contempt; angy hatred) against the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God];"
Ezekiel,25,7,"Behold, therefore I will stretch out my hand upon you i , and will deliver you i for a spoil (plunder; prey; booty) to the heathen; and I will cut you i off from the people, and I will cause you i to perish out of the countries: I will destroy you i ; and you i shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,25,8,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Because that Mo’av [Seed of my Father] and Se’ir [Shaggy] do say, Behold, the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] [is] like unto all the heathen;"
Ezekiel,25,9,"Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] from the cities, from his cities [which are] on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beit-Yeshimot [House of the Desolation] , Ba’al-M’on [lord of the Habitation] , and Kiryatayim [two cities],"
Ezekiel,25,10,"Unto the men of the east with the ‘Amon [Inbred] , and will give them in possession, that the ‘Amon [Inbred] may not be remembered among the nations."
Ezekiel,25,11,And I will execute judgments upon Mo’av [Seed of my Father] ; and they shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
Ezekiel,25,12,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Because that Edom [Red] has dealt against the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;"
Ezekiel,25,13,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; I will also stretch out my hand upon Edom [Red] , and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman [south] ; and they of D’dan [low country] shall fall by the sword."
Ezekiel,25,14,"And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom [Red] by the hand of my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and they shall do in Edom [Red] according to my anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,25,15,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Because the P’lishtim [Immigrants] have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy [it] for the old hatred;"
Ezekiel,25,16,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and I will cut off the K’reti [executioners] , and destroy the remnant of the sea coast."

Ezekiel,26,1,"And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first [day] of the month, [that] the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,26,2,"Son of man, because that Tzor (Tyrus) [a rock] has said against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , Aha, she is broken [that was] the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I shall be replenished, [now] she is laid waste:"
Ezekiel,26,3,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I [am] against you i , O Tzor (Tyrus) [a rock] , and will cause many nations to come up against you i , as the sea causes his waves to come up."

Ezekiel,26,5,"It shall be [a place for] the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken [it] , says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) : and it shall become a spoil (plunder; prey; booty) to the nations."
Ezekiel,26,6,And her daughters which [are] in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).

Ezekiel,26,10,"By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover you i : your i walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into your i gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach (breaking forth; a break; opening, inlet)."

Ezekiel,26,13,And I will cause the noise of your i songs to cease; and the sound of your i harps shall be no more heard.
Ezekiel,26,14,"And I will make you i like the top of a rock: you i shall be [a place] to spread nets upon; you i shall be built no more: for I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have spoken [it] , says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,26,15,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) to Tzor (Tyrus) [a rock] ; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of your i fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of you i?"
Ezekiel,26,16,"Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their adorned with needlework garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at [every] moment, and be astonished at you i."
Ezekiel,26,17,"And they shall take up a lamentation for you i , and say to you i , How are you i destroyed, [that were] inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which were strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror [to be] on all that haunt (where one goes freequently) it!"
Ezekiel,26,18,"Now shall the isles tremble in the day of your i fall; yes, the isles that [are] in the sea shall be troubled at your i departure."

Ezekiel,26,20,"When I shall bring you i down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set you i in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that you i be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;"

Ezekiel,28,13,"you i have been in ‘Eden [pleasure] the garden of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; every precious stone [was] you i covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the Carbuncle (a red precious stone) , and gold: the workmanship of your i tambourines and of your i pipes was prepared in you i in the day that you i were created."
Ezekiel,28,14,you i [are] the anointed cherub [keruv] that covers; and I have set you i [so] : you i were upon the holy mountain of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; you i have walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

Ezekiel,29,3,"Speak, and say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I [am] against you i , Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , the great dragon that lies in the midst of his rivers, which has said, My river [is] my own, and I have made [it] for myself."
Ezekiel,29,4,"But I will put hooks in your i jaws, and I will cause the fish of your i rivers to stick unto your i scales, and I will bring you i up out of the midst of your i rivers, and all the fish of your i rivers shall stick unto your i scales."
Ezekiel,29,5,"And I will leave you i [thrown] into the wilderness, you i and all the fish of your i rivers: you i shall fall upon the open fields; you i shall not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given you i for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven."
Ezekiel,29,6,"And all the inhabitants of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,29,7,"When they took hold of you i by your i hand, you i did break, and rend (tear apart; forcefully rip apart) all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon you i , you i broke, and made all their waist to be at a stand."

Ezekiel,29,13,Yet thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; At the end of forty years will I gather the Mitzri from the people to which they were scattered:
Ezekiel,29,14,"And I will bring again the captivity of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and will cause them to return [into] the land of Patros [region of the south] , into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a humble kingdom."

Ezekiel,31,2,"Son of man, speak unto Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and to his multitude; Whom are you i like in you i greatness?"
Ezekiel,31,3,"Behold, the Ashur (Assyrian) [was] a cedar in L’vanon [Whiteness] with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs."
Ezekiel,31,4,"The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field."
Ezekiel,31,5,"Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth."
Ezekiel,31,6,"All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations."
Ezekiel,31,7,"Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters."
Ezekiel,31,8,"The cedars in the garden of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was like unto him in his beauty."
Ezekiel,31,9,"I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of ‘Eden [pleasure] , that [were] in the garden of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , envied him."
Ezekiel,31,10,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Because you i have lifted up yourself in height, and he has shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;"
Ezekiel,31,11,I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.
Ezekiel,31,12,"And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him."
Ezekiel,31,13,"Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:"
Ezekiel,31,14,"To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the lower parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit."
Ezekiel,31,15,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were detained (held) : and I caused L’vanon [Whiteness] to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him."
Ezekiel,31,16,"I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of ‘Eden [pleasure] , the choice and best of L’vanon [Whiteness] , all that drink water, shall be comforted in the lower parts of the earth."
Ezekiel,31,17,"They also went down into hell with him unto [them that be] slain with the sword; and [they that were] his arm, [that] dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen."
Ezekiel,31,18,"To whom are you i thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of ‘Eden [pleasure] ? yet shall you i be brought down with the trees of ‘Eden [pleasure] unto the lower parts of the earth: you i shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with [them that be] slain by the sword. This [is] Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] and all his multitude, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,32,1,"And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first [day] of the month, [that] the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,32,2,"Son of man, take up a lamentation for Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and say unto him, you i are like a young lion of the nations, and you i [are] as a whale in the seas: and you i came forth with your i rivers, and troubled the waters with your i feet, and fouled their rivers."
Ezekiel,32,3,Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; I will therefore spread out my net over you i with a company of many people; and they shall bring you i up in my net.
Ezekiel,32,4,"Then will I leave you i upon the land, I will cast you i forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon you i , and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with you i."
Ezekiel,32,5,"And I will lay your i flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with your i height."

Ezekiel,32,10,"Yes, I will make many people amazed at you i , and their kings shall be horribly afraid for you i , when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at [every] moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your i fall."
Ezekiel,32,11,"For thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; The sword of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] shall come upon you i."
Ezekiel,32,12,"By the swords of the mighty will I cause your i multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil (plunder; prey; booty) the pomp of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed."
Ezekiel,32,13,"I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them anymore, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them."
Ezekiel,32,14,"Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,32,15,"When I shall make the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall strike all them that dwell in it, then shall they know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,32,16,"This [is] the lamentation which they shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her, [even] for Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and for all her multitude, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,32,17,"It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth [day] of the month, [that] the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"

Ezekiel,33,1,"Again the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,33,2,"Son of man, speak to the children of your i people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:"
Ezekiel,33,3,"If when he sees the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;"
Ezekiel,33,4,"Then whosoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and takes not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head."
Ezekiel,33,5,"He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that takes warning shall deliver his soul."
Ezekiel,33,6,"But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take [any] person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand."
Ezekiel,33,7,"So you i , O Son of man, I have set you i a watchman unto the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; therefore you i shall hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me."
Ezekiel,33,8,"When I say unto the wicked, O wicked [man] , you i shall surely die; if you i do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked [man] shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your i hand."
Ezekiel,33,9,"Nevertheless, if you i warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you i have delivered your i soul."
Ezekiel,33,10,"Therefore, O you i Son of man, speak unto the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; Thus you 2f speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins [be] upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?"
Ezekiel,33,11,"Say unto them, [As] I live, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn you 2f , turn you 2f from your evil ways; for why will you 2f die, O house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
Ezekiel,33,12,"Therefore, you i Son of man, say unto the children of your i people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turns from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his [righteousness] in the day that he sins."
Ezekiel,33,13,"When I shall say to the righteous, [that] he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he has committed, he shall die for it."
Ezekiel,33,14,"Again, when I say unto the wicked, you i shall surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;"
Ezekiel,33,15," [If] the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die."
Ezekiel,33,16,None of his sins that he has committed shall be mentioned unto him: he has done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
Ezekiel,33,17,"Yet the children of you i people say, The way of the Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All Things] is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal."
Ezekiel,33,18,"When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, he shall even die thereby."
Ezekiel,33,19,"But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby."
Ezekiel,33,20,"Yet you 2f say, The way of the Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All Things] is not equal. O you 2f house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , I will judge you everyone after his ways."
Ezekiel,33,21,"And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth [month] , in the fifth [day] of the month, [that] one that had escaped out of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] came unto me, saying, The city is smitten."
Ezekiel,33,22,"Now the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb."
Ezekiel,33,23,"Then the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,33,24,"Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] speak, saying, Avraham [Exalted Father] was one, and he inherited the land: but we [are] many; the land is given us for inheritance."
Ezekiel,33,25,"For what reason say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; You 2f eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall you 2f possess the land?"
Ezekiel,33,26,"You 2f stand upon your sword, you 2f work abomination, and you 2f defile everyone his neighbour’s wife: and shall you 2f possess the land?"
Ezekiel,33,27,"Say you i thus unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER); [As] I live, surely they that [are] in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that [is] in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that [be] in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence."
Ezekiel,33,28,"For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall be desolate, that none shall pass through."
Ezekiel,33,29,"Then shall they know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed."
Ezekiel,33,30,"Also, you i Son of man, the children of you i people still are talking against you i by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, everyone to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that comes forth from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,33,31,"And they come unto you i as the people comes, and they sit before you i [as] my people, and they hear your i words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they show much love, [but] their heart goes after their covetousness."
Ezekiel,33,32,"And, lo, you i [are] unto them as a very lovely song of one that has a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear your i words, but they do them not."
Ezekiel,33,33,"And when this comes to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet has been among them."
Ezekiel,34,1,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,34,2,"Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , prophesy, and say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) unto the shepherds; Woe [be] to the shepherds of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?"
Ezekiel,34,3,"You 2f eat the fat, and you 2f clothe you with the wool, you 2f kill them that are fed: [but] you 2f feed not the flock."
Ezekiel,34,4,"The diseased have you 2f not strengthened, neither have you 2f healed that which was sick, neither have you 2f bound up [that which was] broken, neither have you 2f brought again that which was driven away, neither have you 2f sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have you 2f ruled them."
Ezekiel,34,5,"And they were scattered, because [there is] no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered."
Ezekiel,34,6,"My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yes, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek [after them]."
Ezekiel,34,7,"Therefore, you 2f shepherds, hear the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate);"
Ezekiel,34,8," [As] I live, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because [there was] no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;"
Ezekiel,34,9,"Therefore, O you 2f shepherds, hear the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate);"
Ezekiel,34,10,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I [am] against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves anymore; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them."
Ezekiel,34,11,"For thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I, [even] I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out."
Ezekiel,34,12,"As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep [that are] scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day."
Ezekiel,34,13,"And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country."
Ezekiel,34,14,"I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and [in] a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,34,15,"I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,34,16,"I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up [that which was] broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment."
Ezekiel,34,17,"And [as for] you, O my flock, thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats."
Ezekiel,34,18," [Seem it] a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but you 2f must trample down with your feet the residue (part that remains, the rest) of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but you 2f must foul the residue (part that remains, the rest) with your feet?"
Ezekiel,34,19,"And [as for] my flock, they eat that which you 2f have trampled with your feet; and they drink that which you 2f have fouled with your feet."
Ezekiel,34,20,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) unto them; Behold, I, [even] I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle."
Ezekiel,34,21,"Because you 2f have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till you 2f have scattered them abroad;"
Ezekiel,34,22,"Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle."
Ezekiel,34,23,"And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, [even] my servant David [beloved] ; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd."
Ezekiel,34,24,"And I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will be their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and my servant David [beloved] a prince among them; I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have spoken [it]."
Ezekiel,34,25,"And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods."
Ezekiel,34,26,And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.
Ezekiel,34,27,"And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them."
Ezekiel,34,28,"And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make [them] afraid."
Ezekiel,34,29,"And I will raise up for them a plant of renown (great reputation; being well-known), and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more."
Ezekiel,34,30,"Thus shall they know that I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [am] with them, and [that] they, [even] the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [are] my people, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,34,31,"And you 2f my flock, the flock of my pasture, [are] men, [and] I [am] your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,35,1,"Moreover the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,35,2,"Son of man, set your i face against mount Se’ir [Shaggy] , and prophesy against it,"
Ezekiel,35,3,"And say unto it, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, O mount Se’ir [Shaggy] , I [am] against you i , and I will stretch out my hand against you i , and I will make you i most desolate."
Ezekiel,35,4,"I will lay your i cities waste, and you i shall be desolate, and you i shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,35,5,"Because you i have had a perpetual hatred, and have shed [the blood of] the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time [that their] iniquity [had] an end:"
Ezekiel,35,6,"Therefore, [as] I live, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , I will prepare you i unto blood, and blood shall pursue you i : since you i have not hated blood, even blood shall pursue you i."
Ezekiel,35,7,"Thus will I make mount Se’ir [Shaggy] most desolate, and cut off from it him that passes out and him that returns."
Ezekiel,35,8,"And I will fill his mountains with his slain [men] : in you i hills, and in you i valleys, and in all your i rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword."
Ezekiel,35,9,"I will make you i perpetual desolations, and your i cities shall not return: and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,35,10,"Because you i have said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was there:"
Ezekiel,35,11,"Therefore, [as] I live, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , I will even do according to yourri anger, and according to you i envy which you i have used out of your i hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged you i."
Ezekiel,35,12,"And you i shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [and that] I have heard all your i blasphemies which you i have spoken against the mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume."
Ezekiel,35,13,"Thus with your mouth you 2f have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against Me: I have heard [them]."
Ezekiel,35,14,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you i desolate."
Ezekiel,35,15,"As you i did rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , because it was desolate, so will I do unto you i : you i shall be desolate, O mount Se’ir [Shaggy] , and all Edom [red], [even] all of it: and they shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,36,1,"Also, you i Son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and say, You 2f mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , hear the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):"
Ezekiel,36,2,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Because the enemy has said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession:"
Ezekiel,36,3,"Therefore prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Because they have made [you] desolate, and swallow (to approve, commend, accept)ed you up on every side, that you 2f might be a possession unto the residue (part that remains, the rest) of the heathen, and you 2f are taken up in the lips of talkers, and [are] an infamy of the people:"
Ezekiel,36,4,"Therefore, you 2f mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , hear the word of the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and ridicule (laughing at enemies’ threats) to the residue (part that remains, the rest) of the heathen that [are] round about;"
Ezekiel,36,5,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue (part that remains, the rest) of the heathen, and against all Edom [red] , which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all [their] heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey."
Ezekiel,36,6,"Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because you 2f have borne the shame of the heathen:"
Ezekiel,36,7,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; I have lifted up my hand, Surely the heathen that [are] about you, they shall bear their shame."
Ezekiel,36,8,"But you 2f , O mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , you 2f shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; for they are at hand to come."
Ezekiel,36,9,"For, behold, I [am] for you, and I will turn unto you, and you 2f shall be tilled and sown:"
Ezekiel,36,10,"And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [even] all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be built:"
Ezekiel,36,11,"And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better [unto you] than at your beginnings: and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,36,12,"Yes, I will cause men to walk upon you, [even] my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and they shall possess you i , and you i shall be their inheritance, and you i shall no more from this time forth (from now on) bereave them [of men]."
Ezekiel,36,13,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Because they say unto you, your i [land] devours up men, and have bereaved your i nations;"
Ezekiel,36,14,"Therefore you i shall devour men no more, neither bereave your i nations any more, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,36,15,"Neither will I cause [men] to hear in you i the shame of the heathen any more, neither shall you i bear the reproach (disgrace; shame) of the people any more, neither shall you i cause your i nations to fall any more, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,36,16,"Moreover the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,36,17,"Son of man, when the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman."
Ezekiel,36,18,"For what reason I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols [which] they had polluted it:"
Ezekiel,36,19,"And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them."
Ezekiel,36,20,"And when they entered unto the heathen, to which they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These [are] the people of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and are gone forth out of his land."
Ezekiel,36,21,"But I had pity for my holy name, which the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] had profaned among the heathen, to which they went."
Ezekiel,36,22,"Therefore say unto the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; I do not [this] for your sakes, O house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , but for my holy name’s sake, which you 2f have profaned among the heathen, to which you 2f went."
Ezekiel,36,23,"And I will sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which you 2f have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes."
Ezekiel,36,24,"For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land."
Ezekiel,36,25,"Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and you 2f shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you."
Ezekiel,36,26,"A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh."
Ezekiel,36,27,"And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and you 2f shall keep my judgments, and do [them]."
Ezekiel,36,28,"And you 2f shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and you 2f shall be my people, and I will be your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ezekiel,36,29,"I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you."
Ezekiel,36,30,"And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that you 2f shall receive no more reproach (disgrace; shame) of famine among the heathen."
Ezekiel,36,31,"Then shall you 2f remember your own evil ways, and your doings that [were] not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations."
Ezekiel,36,32,"Not for your sakes do I [this] , says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,36,33,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause [you] to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be built."
Ezekiel,36,34,"And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by."
Ezekiel,36,35,"And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of ‘Eden [pleasure] ; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities [are become] fenced, [and] are inhabited."
Ezekiel,36,36,"Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) build the ruined [places, and] plant that that was desolate: I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have spoken [it] , and I will do [it]."
Ezekiel,36,37,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; I will yet [for] this be enquired of by the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , to do [it] for them; I will increase them with men like a flock."
Ezekiel,36,38,"As the holy flock, as the flock of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,37,1,"The hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was upon me, and carried me out in the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and set me down in the midst of the valley which [was] full of bones,"
Ezekiel,37,2,"And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, [there were] very many in the open valley; and, lo, [they were] very dry."
Ezekiel,37,3,"And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , you i know."
Ezekiel,37,4,"Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O you 2f dry bones, hear the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,37,5,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you 2f shall live:"
Ezekiel,37,6,"And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you 2f shall live; and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,37,7,"So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone."
Ezekiel,37,8,"And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but [there was] no breath in them."
Ezekiel,37,9,"Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, Son of man, and say to the wind, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live."
Ezekiel,37,10,"So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army."
Ezekiel,37,11,"Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts."
Ezekiel,37,12,"Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,37,13,"And you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,"
Ezekiel,37,14,"And shall put my spirit in you, and you 2f shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall you 2f know that I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have spoken [it] , and performed [it] , says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,37,15,"The word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came again unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,37,16,"Moreover, you i Son of man, take you i one stick, and write upon it, For Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and for the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Yosef [(God) He Shall Add] , the stick of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , and [for] all the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] his companions:"
Ezekiel,37,17,And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in you i hand.
Ezekiel,37,18,"And when the children of your i people shall speak unto you i , saying, Will you i not show us what you i [mean] by these?"
Ezekiel,37,19,"Say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I will take the stick of Yosef [(God) He Shall Add] , which [is] in the hand of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , and the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] his fellows, and will put them with him, [even] with the stick of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand."
Ezekiel,37,20,And the sticks whereon you i write shall be in your i hand before their eyes.
Ezekiel,37,21,"And say unto them, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I will take the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] from among the heathen, to which they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:"
Ezekiel,37,22,"And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:"
Ezekiel,37,23,"Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Ezekiel,37,24,"And David [beloved] my servant [shall be] king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them."
Ezekiel,37,25,"And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Ya’akov [Heal of God] my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell in it, [even] they, and their children, and their children’s children forever: and my servant David [beloved] [shall be] their prince forever."
Ezekiel,37,26,"Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore."
Ezekiel,37,27,"My tabernacle also shall be with them: yes, I will be their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and they shall be my people."
Ezekiel,37,28,"And the heathen shall know that I the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) do sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forevermore."
Ezekiel,38,1,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,38,2,"Son of man, set your i face against Gog [mountain] , the land of Magog [land of God] , the chief prince of Meshekh [drawing out] and Tuval [you shall be brought] , and prophesy against him,"
Ezekiel,38,3,"And say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I [am] against you i , O Gog [mountain] , the chief prince of Meshekh [drawing out] and Tuval [you shall be brought]:"
Ezekiel,38,4,"And I will turn you i back, and put hooks into your i jaws, and I will bring you i forth, and all your i army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts [of armour, even] a great company [with] bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:"
Ezekiel,38,5,"Paras (Persia) [pure or splendid] , Ethiopia [Kush] , and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet:"
Ezekiel,38,6,"Gomer [complete] , and all his bands; the house of Togarmah [you will break her] of the north quarters, and all his bands: [and] many people with you i."
Ezekiel,38,7,"Be you i prepared, and prepare for yourself, you i , and all your i company that are assembled unto you i , and be you i a guard unto them."
Ezekiel,38,8,"After many days you i shall be visited: in the latter years you i shall come into the land [that is] brought back from the sword, [and is] gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them."
Ezekiel,38,9,"you i shall ascend and come like a storm, you i shall be like a cloud to cover the land, you i , and all your i troops, and many people with you i."
Ezekiel,38,10,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; It shall also come to pass, [that] at the same time shall things come into your i mind, and you i shall think an evil thought:"
Ezekiel,38,11,"And you i shall say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,"
Ezekiel,38,12,"To take a spoil (plunder; prey; booty) , and to take a prey; to turn your i hand upon the desolate places [that are now] inhabited, and upon the people [that are] gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land."
Ezekiel,38,13,"Sheva [Seven] , and D’dan [low country] , and the merchants of Tarshish [yellow jasper] , with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto you i , Are you i come to take a spoil (plunder; prey; booty) ? have you i gathered your i company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil (plunder; prey; booty)?"
Ezekiel,38,14,"Therefore, Son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog [mountain] , Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; In that day when my people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] dwells safely, shall you i not know [it]?"
Ezekiel,38,15,"And you i shall come from your i place out of the north parts, you i , and many people with you i , all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army:"
Ezekiel,38,16,"And you i shall come up against my people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring you i against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in you i , O Gog [mountain] , before their eyes."
Ezekiel,38,17,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER); [Are] you i he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which prophesied in those days [many] years that I would bring you i against them?"
Ezekiel,38,18,"And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog [mountain] shall come against the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER), [that] my fury shall come up in my face."
Ezekiel,38,19,"For in my jealousy [and] in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God];"
Ezekiel,38,20,"So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that [are] upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to (to do entirely, do wholly) the ground."
Ezekiel,38,21,"And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) : every man’s sword shall be against his brother."
Ezekiel,38,22,"And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that [are] with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and sulfur."
Ezekiel,38,23,"Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,39,1,"Therefore, you i Son of man, prophesy against Gog [mountain] , and say, Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Behold, I [am] against you i , O Gog [mountain] , the chief prince of Meshekh [drawing out] and Tuval [you shall be brought]:"
Ezekiel,39,2,"And I will turn you i back, and leave but the sixth part of you i , and will cause you i to come up from the north parts, and will bring you i upon the mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]:"
Ezekiel,39,3,"And I will strike your i bow out of your i left hand, and will cause your i arrows to fall out of your i right hand."
Ezekiel,39,4,"you i shall fall upon the mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , you i , and all you i troops, and the people that [is] with you i : I will give you i unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and [to] the beasts of the field to be devoured."
Ezekiel,39,5,"you i shall fall upon the open field: for I have spoken [it] , says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,39,6,"And I will send a fire on Magog [land of God] , and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,39,7,"So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and I will not [let them] pollute my holy name any more: and the heathen shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the Holy One in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,39,8,"Behold, it is come, and it is done, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; this [is] the day whereof I have spoken."
Ezekiel,39,9,"And they that dwell in the cities of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:"
Ezekiel,39,10,"So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down [any] out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall spoil (plunder; prey; booty) those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,39,11,"And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] I will give unto Gog [mountain] a place there of graves in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the [noses] of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog [mountain] and all his multitude: and they shall call [it] The Valley of Hamon-Gog [multitude of Gog]."
Ezekiel,39,12,"And seven months shall the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land."
Ezekiel,39,13,"Yes, all the people of the land shall bury [them] ; and it shall be to them a renown (great reputation; being well-known) the day that I shall be glorified, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,39,14,"And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the travelers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search."
Ezekiel,39,15,"And the travelers [that] pass through the land, when [any] sees a man’s bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-Gog [multitude of Gog]."
Ezekiel,39,16,And also the name of the city [shall be] Hamonah [multitudes] . Thus shall they cleanse the land.
Ezekiel,39,17,"And, you i Son of man, thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, [even] a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that you 2f may eat flesh, and drink blood."
Ezekiel,39,18,"You 2f shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan [Fruitful]."
Ezekiel,39,19,"And you 2f shall eat fat till you 2f be full, and drink blood till you 2f be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you."
Ezekiel,39,20,"Thus you 2f shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,39,21,"And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them."
Ezekiel,39,22,So the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] from that day and forward.
Ezekiel,39,23,"And the heathen shall know that the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword."
Ezekiel,39,24,"According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them."
Ezekiel,39,25,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Now will I bring again the captivity of Ya’akov [Heal of God] , and have mercy upon the whole house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and will be jealous for my holy name;"
Ezekiel,39,26,"After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made [them] afraid."
Ezekiel,39,27,"When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;"
Ezekiel,39,28,"Then shall they know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them anymore there."
Ezekiel,39,29,"Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,40,1,"In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth [day] of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was upon me, and brought me there."
Ezekiel,40,2,"In the visions of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] brought he me into the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and set me upon a very high mountain, by which [was] as the frame of a city on the south."
Ezekiel,40,3,"And he brought me there, and, behold, [there was] a man, whose appearance [was] like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate."
Ezekiel,40,4,"And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with your i eyes, and hear with your i ears, and set your i heart upon all that I shall show you i ; for to the intent that I might show [them] unto you i [are] you i brought here: declare all that you i see to the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,40,5,"And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed of six cubits [long] by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed."
Ezekiel,40,6,"Then came he unto the gate which looks toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, [which was] one reed broad; and the other threshold [of the gate, which was] one reed broad."
Ezekiel,40,7,"And [every] little chamber [was] one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers [were] five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within [was] one reed."
Ezekiel,40,8,"He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed."
Ezekiel,40,9,"Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate [was] inward."
Ezekiel,40,10,"And the little chambers of the gate eastward [were] three on this side, and three on that side; they three [were] of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side."
Ezekiel,40,11,"And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; [and] the length of the gate, thirteen cubits."
Ezekiel,40,12,"The space also before the little chambers [was] one cubit [on this side] , and the space [was] one cubit on that side: and the little chambers [were] six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side."
Ezekiel,40,13,"He measured then the gate from the roof of [one] little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth [was] five and twenty cubits, door against door."
Ezekiel,40,14,"He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate."
Ezekiel,40,15,And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate [were] fifty cubits.
Ezekiel,40,16,"And [there were] narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows [were] round about inward: and upon [each] post [were] palm trees."
Ezekiel,40,17,"Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, [there were] chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers [were] upon the pavement."
Ezekiel,40,18,And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates [was] the lower pavement.
Ezekiel,40,19,"Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward."
Ezekiel,40,20,"And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof."
Ezekiel,40,21,"And the little chambers thereof [were] three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof [was] fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits."
Ezekiel,40,22,"And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, [were] after the measure of the gate that looks toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof [were] before them."
Ezekiel,40,23,"And the gate of the inner court [was] over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits."
Ezekiel,40,24,"After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures."
Ezekiel,40,25,"And [there were] windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length [was] fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits."
Ezekiel,40,26,"And [there were] seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof [were] before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof."
Ezekiel,40,27,And [there was] a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.
Ezekiel,40,28,And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;

Ezekiel,40,37,"And the posts thereof [were] toward the outer court; and palm trees [were] upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it [had] eight steps."
Ezekiel,40,38,"And the chambers and the entries thereof [were] by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering."
Ezekiel,40,39,"And in the porch of the gate [were] two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering."
Ezekiel,40,40,"And at the side without, as one goes up to the entry of the north gate, [were] two tables; and on the other side, which [was] at the porch of the gate, [were] two tables."
Ezekiel,40,41,"Four tables [were] on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they killed [their sacrifices]."
Ezekiel,40,42,"And the four tables [were] of cut stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice."
Ezekiel,40,43,"And within [were] hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables [was] the flesh of the offering."
Ezekiel,40,44,"And without the inner gate [were] the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which [was] at the side of the north gate; and their prospect [was] toward the south: one at the side of the east gate [having] the prospect toward the north."
Ezekiel,40,45,"And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect [is] toward the south, [is] for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house."
Ezekiel,40,46,"And the chamber whose prospect [is] toward the north [is] for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these [are] the sons of Tzadok [righteous] among the sons of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] , which come near to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to minister unto him."

Ezekiel,41,2,"And the breadth of the door [was] ten cubits; and the sides of the door [were] five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits."
Ezekiel,41,3,"Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits."
Ezekiel,41,4,"So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This [is] the most holy [place]."
Ezekiel,41,5,"After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of [every] side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side."
Ezekiel,41,6,"And the side chambers [were] three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which [was] of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house."
Ezekiel,41,7,"And [there was] an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house [was still] upward, and so increased [from] the lowest [chamber] to the highest by the midst."
Ezekiel,41,8,I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers [were] a full reed of six great cubits.
Ezekiel,41,9,"The thickness of the wall, which [was] for the side chamber without, [was] five cubits: and [that] which [was] left [was] the place of the side chambers that [were] within."
Ezekiel,41,10,And between the chambers [was] the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.
Ezekiel,41,11,"And the doors of the side chambers [were] toward [the place that was] left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left [was] five cubits round about."
Ezekiel,41,12,"Now the building that [was] before the separate place at the end toward the west [was] seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building [was] five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits."
Ezekiel,41,13,"So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;"
Ezekiel,41,14,"Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits."
Ezekiel,41,15,"And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which [was] behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;"
Ezekiel,41,16,"The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, ceilinged with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows [were] covered;"
Ezekiel,41,17,"To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure."
Ezekiel,41,18,"And [it was] made with k’vurim (cherubim) and palm trees, so that a palm tree [was] between a cherub [keruv] and a cherub [keruv] ; and [every] cherub [keruv] had two faces;"
Ezekiel,41,19,"So that the face of a man [was] toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: [it was] made through all the house round about."
Ezekiel,41,20,"From the ground unto above the door [were] k’vurim (cherubim) and palm trees made, and [on] the wall of the temple."
Ezekiel,41,21,"The posts of the temple [were] squared, [and] the face of the sanctuary; the appearance [of the one] as the appearance [of the other]."
Ezekiel,41,22,"The altar of wood [was] three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, [were] of wood: and he said unto me, This [is] the table that [is] before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,41,23,And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
Ezekiel,41,24,"And the doors had two leaves [apiece] , two turning leaves; two [leaves] for the one door, and two leaves for the other [door]."
Ezekiel,41,25,"And [there were] made on them, on the doors of the temple, k’vurim (cherubim) and palm trees, like as [were] made upon the walls; and [there were] thick planks upon the face of the porch without."
Ezekiel,41,26,"And [there were] narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and [upon] the side chambers of the house, and thick planks."
Ezekiel,42,1,"Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that [was] over against the separate place, and which [was] before the building toward the north."
Ezekiel,42,2,"Before the length of an hundred cubits [was] the north door, and the breadth [was] fifty cubits."
Ezekiel,42,3,"Over against the twenty [cubits] which [were] for the inner court, and over against the pavement which [was] for the outer court, [was] gallery against gallery in three [stories]."
Ezekiel,42,4,"And before the chambers [was] a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north."
Ezekiel,42,5,"Now the upper chambers [were] shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building."
Ezekiel,42,6,"For they [were] in three [stories] , but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore [the building] was straitened (impeded or restricted; narrowed, distressed) more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground."
Ezekiel,42,7,"And the wall that [was] without over against the chambers, toward the outer court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof [was] fifty cubits."
Ezekiel,42,8,"For the length of the chambers that [were] in the outer court [was] fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple [were] an hundred cubits."
Ezekiel,42,9,"And from under these chambers [was] the entry on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court."
Ezekiel,42,10,"The chambers [were] in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building."
Ezekiel,42,11,"And the way before them [was] like the appearance of the chambers which [were] toward the north, as long as they, [and] as broad as they: and all their goings out [were] both according to their fashions, and according to their doors."
Ezekiel,42,12,"And according to the doors of the chambers that [were] toward the south [was] a door in the head of the way, [even] the way directly before the wall to (to do entirely, do wholly) ward (in custody, with a guard; prison) the east, as one enters into them."
Ezekiel,42,13,"Then said he unto me, The north chambers [and] the south chambers, which [are] before the separate place, they [be] holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place [is] holy."
Ezekiel,42,14,"When the priests enter in it, then shall they not go out of the holy [place] into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they [are] holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to [those things] which [are] for the people."
Ezekiel,42,15,"Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect [is] toward the east, and measured it round about."
Ezekiel,42,16,"He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about."
Ezekiel,42,17,"He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about."
Ezekiel,42,18,"He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed."
Ezekiel,42,19,"He turned about to the west side, [and] measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed."
Ezekiel,42,20,"He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred [reeds] long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the Profane (treat as common; defile) place."
Ezekiel,43,1,"Afterward he brought me to the gate, [even] the gate that looks toward the east:"
Ezekiel,43,2,"And, behold, the glory of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came from the way of the east: and his voice [was] like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory."
Ezekiel,43,3,"And [it was] according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, [even] according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions [were] like the vision that I saw by the river K’var [far-off] ; and I fell upon my face."
Ezekiel,43,4,And the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect [is] toward the east.
Ezekiel,43,5,"So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) filled the house."
Ezekiel,43,6,And I heard [him] speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me.
Ezekiel,43,7,"And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] forever, and my holy name, shall the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] no more defile, [neither] they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places."
Ezekiel,43,8,"In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in my anger."
Ezekiel,43,9,"Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcasses of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them forever."
Ezekiel,43,10,"you i Son of man, show the house to the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern."
Ezekiel,43,11,"And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, show them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write [it] in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them."
Ezekiel,43,12,"This [is] the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about [shall be] most holy. Behold, this [is] the law of the house."
Ezekiel,43,13,"And these [are] the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit [is] a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom [shall be] a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about [shall be] a span: and this [shall be] the higher place of the altar."
Ezekiel,43,14,"And from the bottom [upon] the ground [even] to the lower settle [shall be] two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle [even] to the greater settle [shall be] four cubits, and the breadth [one] cubit."
Ezekiel,43,15,So the altar [shall be] four cubits; and from the altar and upward [shall be] four horns.
Ezekiel,43,16,"And the altar [shall be] twelve [cubits] long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof."
Ezekiel,43,17,And the settle [shall be] fourteen [cubits] long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it [shall be] half a cubit; and the bottom thereof [shall be] a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.
Ezekiel,43,18,"And he said unto me, Son of man, thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; These [are] the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon."
Ezekiel,43,19,"And you i shall give to the priests the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] that be of the seed of Tzadok [righteous] , which approach unto me, to minister unto me, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , a young bullock for a sin offering."
Ezekiel,43,20,"And you i shall take of the blood thereof, and put [it] on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shall you i cleanse and purge it."
Ezekiel,43,21,"you i shall take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,43,22,"And on the second day you i shall offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse [it] with the bullock."
Ezekiel,43,23,"When you i have made an end of cleansing [it] , you i shall offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish."
Ezekiel,43,24,"And you i shall offer them before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up [for] a burnt offering unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,43,25,"Seven days shall you i prepare every day a goat [for] a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish."
Ezekiel,43,26,Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate (treat as set apart or separate unto God) themselves.
Ezekiel,43,27,"And when these days are expired, it shall be, [that] upon the eighth day, and [so] forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,44,1,Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looks toward the east; and it [was] shut.
Ezekiel,44,2,"Then said the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , has entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut."
Ezekiel,44,3," [It is] for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; he shall enter by the way of the porch of [that] gate, and shall go out by the way of the same."
Ezekiel,44,4,"Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) filled the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and I fell upon my face."
Ezekiel,44,5,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with your i eyes, and hear with your i ears all that I say unto you i concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,44,6,"And you i shall say to the rebellious, [even] to the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; O you 2f house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , let it suffice you of all your abominations,"
Ezekiel,44,7,"In that you 2f have brought [into my sanctuary] strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, [even] my house, when you 2f offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations."
Ezekiel,44,8,And you 2f have not kept the charge of my holy things: but you 2f have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
Ezekiel,44,9,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that [is] among the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,44,10,"And the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] that are gone away far from me, when Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity."
Ezekiel,44,11,"Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, [having] charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them."
Ezekiel,44,12,"Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , and they shall bear their iniquity."
Ezekiel,44,13,"And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy [place] : but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed."
Ezekiel,44,14,"But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done in it."
Ezekiel,44,15,"But the priests the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , the sons of Tzadok [righteous] , that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER):"
Ezekiel,44,16,"They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge."
Ezekiel,44,17,"And it shall come to pass, [that] when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within."
Ezekiel,44,18,"They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen trousers upon their waist; they shall not gird [themselves] with anything that causes sweat."
Ezekiel,44,19,"And when they go forth into the outer court, [even] into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) the people with their garments."
Ezekiel,44,20,"Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads."
Ezekiel,44,21,"Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court."
Ezekiel,44,22,"Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , or a widow that had a priest before."
Ezekiel,44,23,"And they shall teach my people [the difference] between the holy and Profane (treat as common; defile) , and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean."
Ezekiel,44,24,"And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; [and] they shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my assemblies; and they shall hallow (to approve, commend, accept) my Shabbat."
Ezekiel,44,25,"And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that has had no husband, they may defile themselves."
Ezekiel,44,26,"And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days."
Ezekiel,44,27,"And in the day that he goes into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,44,28,And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I [am] their inheritance: and you 2f shall give them no possession in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : I [am] their possession.
Ezekiel,44,29,"They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall be theirs."
Ezekiel,44,30,"And the first of all the firstfruits of all [things] , and every oblation of all, of every [sort] of your oblations, shall be the priest’s: you 2f shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in you i house."
Ezekiel,44,31,"The priests shall not eat of anything that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast."
Ezekiel,45,1,"Moreover, when you 2f shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, you 2f shall offer an oblation unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , an holy portion of the land: the length [shall be] the length of five and twenty thousand [reeds] , and the breadth [shall be] ten thousand. This [shall be] holy in all the borders thereof round about."
Ezekiel,45,2,"Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred [in length] , with five hundred [in breadth] , square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof."
Ezekiel,45,3,"And of this measure shall you i measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary [and] the most holy [place]."
Ezekiel,45,4,"The holy [portion] of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary."
Ezekiel,45,5,"And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers."
Ezekiel,45,6,"And you 2f shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy [portion] : it shall be for the whole house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,45,7,"And a [portion shall be] for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy [portion] , and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy [portion] , and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length [shall be] over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border."
Ezekiel,45,8,In the land shall be his possession in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and [the rest of] the land shall they give to the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] according to their tribes.
Ezekiel,45,9,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; Let it suffice you, O princes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : remove violence and spoil (plunder; prey; booty) , and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,45,10,"You 2f shall have just balances, and a just eifah, and a just bath."
Ezekiel,45,11,"The eifah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the eifah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer."
Ezekiel,45,12,"And the shekel [shall be] twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh (pound)."
Ezekiel,45,13,"This [is] the oblation that you 2f shall offer; the sixth part of an eifah of an homer of wheat, and you 2f shall give the sixth part of an eifah of an homer of barley:"
Ezekiel,45,14,"Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, [you 2f shall offer] the tenth part of a bath out of the Kor (a measurement), [which is] an homer of ten baths; for ten baths [are] an homer:"
Ezekiel,45,15,"And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
Ezekiel,45,16,All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
Ezekiel,45,17,"And it shall be the prince’s part [to give] burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the Shabbat, in all solemnities of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ezekiel,45,18,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; In the first [month] , in the first [day] of the month, you i shall take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary:"
Ezekiel,45,19,"And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put [it] upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court."
Ezekiel,45,20,"And so you i shall do the seventh [day] of the month for everyone that errs, and for [him that is] simple: so shall you 2f reconcile the house."
Ezekiel,45,21,"In the first [month] , in the fourteenth day of the month, you 2f shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten."
Ezekiel,45,22,And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock [for] a sin offering.
Ezekiel,45,23,"And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily [for] a sin offering."
Ezekiel,45,24,"And he shall prepare a meat offering of an eifah for a bullock, and an eifah for a ram, and an hin [a quart] of oil for an eifah."
Ezekiel,45,25,"In the seventh [month] , in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil."
Ezekiel,46,1,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the Shabbat [Rest] it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened."
Ezekiel,46,2,"And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of [that] gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening."
Ezekiel,46,3,Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in the Shabbat and in the new moons.
Ezekiel,46,4,"And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in the Shabbat [Rest] day [shall be] six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish."
Ezekiel,46,5,"And the meat offering [shall be] an eifah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin [a quart] of oil to an eifah."
Ezekiel,46,6,"And in the day of the new moon [it shall be] a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish."
Ezekiel,46,7,"And he shall prepare a meat offering, an eifah for a bullock, and an eifah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin [a quart] of oil to an eifah."
Ezekiel,46,8,"And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of [that] gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof."
Ezekiel,46,9,"But when the people of the land shall come before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in the solemn feasts, he that enters in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that enters by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it."
Ezekiel,46,10,"And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth."
Ezekiel,46,11,"And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an eifah to a bullock, and an eifah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin [a quart] of oil to an eifah."
Ezekiel,46,12,"Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [one] shall then open him the gate that looks toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the Shabbat [Rest] day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth [one] shall shut the gate."
Ezekiel,46,13,you i shall daily prepare a burnt offering unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [of] a lamb of the first year without blemish: you i shall prepare it every morning.
Ezekiel,46,14,"And you i shall prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an eifah, and the third part of an hin [a quart] of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Ezekiel,46,15,"Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning [for] a continual burnt offering."
Ezekiel,46,16,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons’; it [shall be] their possession by inheritance."
Ezekiel,46,17,"But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons’ for them."
Ezekiel,46,18,"Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; [but] he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession."
Ezekiel,46,19,"After he brought me through the entry, which [was] at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there [was] a place on the two sides westward."
Ezekiel,46,20,"Then said he unto me, This [is] the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear [them] not out into the outer court, to sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) the people."
Ezekiel,46,21,"Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court [there was] a court."
Ezekiel,46,22,In the four corners of the court [there were] courts joined of forty [cubits] long and thirty broad: these four corners [were] of one measure.
Ezekiel,46,23,"And [there was] a row [of building] round about in them, round about them four, and [it was] made with boiling places under the rows round about."
Ezekiel,46,24,"Then said he unto me, These [are] the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people."
Ezekiel,47,1,"Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house [stood toward] the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south [side] of the altar."
Ezekiel,47,2,"Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the outer gate by the way that looks eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side."
Ezekiel,47,3,"And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters [were] to the ankles."
Ezekiel,47,4,"Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters [were] to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters [were] to the waist."
Ezekiel,47,5,"Afterward he measured a thousand; [and it was] a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over."
Ezekiel,47,6,"And he said unto me, Son of man, have you i seen [this] ? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river."
Ezekiel,47,7,"Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river [were] very many trees on the one side and on the other."
Ezekiel,47,8,"Then said he unto me, These waters issue (what comes forth) out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: [which being] brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed."
Ezekiel,47,9,"And it shall come to pass, [that] every thing that lives, which moves, to wherever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come there: for they shall be healed; and everything shall live to which the river comes."
Ezekiel,47,10,"And it shall come to pass, [that] the fishers shall stand upon it from ‘Ein-Gedi [Fount of the Kid] even unto ‘Ein-Eglayim [fountain of the two calves] ; they shall be a [place] to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many."
Ezekiel,47,11,But the miry places thereof and the marshes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.
Ezekiel,47,12,"And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine."
Ezekiel,47,13,"Thus says the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ; This [shall be] the border, whereby you 2f shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : Yosef [ (God) He Shall Add] [shall have two] portions."
Ezekiel,47,14,"And you 2f shall inherit it, one as well as another: [concerning] the which I lifted up my hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance."
Ezekiel,47,15,"And this [shall be] the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hetlon [hiding place] , as men go to Tz’dad [Mountain Side];"
Ezekiel,47,16,"Hamat [Fortress] , Berotah [cypress grove] , Sigroan (wail; make a foul noise) im [twofold hope] , which [is] between the border of Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] and the border of Hamat [Fortress] ; Hatzer-Hatikhon [middle court] , which [is] by the coast of Havran [caverns]."
Ezekiel,47,17,"And the border from the sea shall be Hatzar-’Einan [Villiage of Fountains] , the border of Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] , and the north northward, and the border of Hamat [Fortress] . And [this is] the north side."
Ezekiel,47,18,"And the east side you 2f shall measure from Havran [caverns] , and from Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] , and from Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , and from the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [by] Yarden [Descender] , from the border unto the east sea. And [this is] the east side."

Ezekiel,47,20,"The west side also [shall be] the great sea from the border, till a man come over against Hamat [Fortress] . This [is] the west side."
Ezekiel,47,21,So shall you 2f divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
Ezekiel,47,22,"And it shall come to pass, [that] you 2f shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget (to be father of; be ancestor of) children among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
