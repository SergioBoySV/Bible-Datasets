Zechariah,1,1,"In the eighth month, in the second year of Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] , came the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers] , the son of Berekhyah [Yehovah blesses] , the son of ‘Iddo [His witness] the prophet, saying,"
Zechariah,1,2,The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has been sore displeased with your fathers.
Zechariah,1,3,"Therefore say you i unto them, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; Turn you 2f unto me, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , and I will turn unto you, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Zechariah,1,4,"Be you 2f not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; Turn you 2f now from your evil ways, and [from] your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Zechariah,1,5,"Your fathers, where [are] they? and the prophets, do they live forever?"
Zechariah,1,6,"But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so has he dealt with us."
Zechariah,1,7,"Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which [is] the month Sh’vat [a rod] , in the second year of Daryavesh (Darius) [lord] , came the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers] , the son of Berekhyah [Yehovah blesses] , the son of ‘Iddo [His witness] the prophet, saying,"
Zechariah,1,8,"I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that [were] in the bottom; and behind him [were there] red horses, speckled, and white."
Zechariah,1,9,"Then said I, O my lord, what [are] these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will show you i what these [be]."
Zechariah,1,10,"And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These [are they] whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has sent to walk to and fro through the earth."
Zechariah,1,11,"And they answered the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits still, and is at rest."
Zechariah,1,12,"Then the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) answered and said, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , how long will you i not have mercy on Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] and on the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , against which you i have had indignation these threescore and ten years?"
Zechariah,1,13,And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) answered the angel that talked with me [with] good words [and] comfortable words.
Zechariah,1,14,"So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry you i , saying, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; I am jealous for Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] and for Tziyon [parched place] with a great jealousy."
Zechariah,1,15,"And I am very sore displeased with the heathen [that are] at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction."
Zechariah,1,16,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; I am returned to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] with mercies: my house shall be built in it, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , and a line shall be stretched forth upon Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Zechariah,1,17,"Cry yet, saying, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall yet comfort Tziyon [parched place] , and shall yet choose Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Zechariah,1,18,"Then lifted I up my eyes, and saw, and behold four horns."
Zechariah,1,19,"And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What [be] these? And he answered me, These [are] the horns which have scattered Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Zechariah,1,20,And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) showed me four carpenters.
Zechariah,1,21,"Then said I, What come these to do? And he spoke, saying, These [are] the horns which have scattered Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to frighten (make afriad) them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up [their] horn over the land of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] to scatter it."
Zechariah,2,1,"I lifted up my eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand."
Zechariah,2,2,"Then said I, Where go you i ? And he said unto me, To measure Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , to see what [is] the breadth thereof, and what [is] the length thereof."
Zechariah,2,3,"And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,"
Zechariah,2,4,"And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] shall be inhabited [as] towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle in it:"
Zechariah,2,5,"For I, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her."
Zechariah,2,6,"Ho, ho, [come forth] , and flee from the land of the north, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Zechariah,2,7,"Deliver yourself, O Tziyon [parched place] , that dwell [with] the daughter of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
Zechariah,2,8,For thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; After the glory has he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that touches you touches the apple of his eye.
Zechariah,2,9,"For, behold, I will shake my hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil (plunder; prey; booty) to their servants: and you 2f shall know that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] has sent me."
Zechariah,2,10,"Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Tziyon [parched place] : for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of you i , says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Zechariah,2,11,"And many nations shall be joined to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of you i , and you i shall know that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] has sent me unto you i."
Zechariah,2,12,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall inherit Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] again."
Zechariah,2,13,"Be silent, O all flesh, before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : for he is raised up out of his holy habitation."
Zechariah,3,1,"And he showed me Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the High Priest standing before the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and Satan (the adversary) standing at his right hand to accuse him."
Zechariah,3,2,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Satan, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) you i , O Satan; even the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) that has chosen Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) you i: [is] not this a brand plucked out of the fire?"
Zechariah,3,3,"Now Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel."
Zechariah,3,4,"And he answered and spoke unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused your i iniquity to pass from you i , and I will clothe you i with change fine clothes"
Zechariah,3,5,"And I said, Let them set a fair mitre (turban; ceremonial headdress) upon his head. So they set a fair mitre (turban; ceremonial headdress) upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) stood by."
Zechariah,3,6,"And the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) protested unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , saying,"
Zechariah,3,7,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; If you i will walk in my ways, and if you i will keep my charge, then you i shall also judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you i free access to walk among these that stand by."
Zechariah,3,8,"Hear now, O Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the High Priest, you i , and your i fellows that sit before you i : for they [are] men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth My servant the BRANCH."
Zechariah,3,9,"For behold the stone that I have laid before Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] ; upon one stone [shall be] seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day."
Zechariah,3,10,"In that day, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , shall you 2f call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree."
Zechariah,4,1,"And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,"
Zechariah,4,2,"And said unto me, What see you i ? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all [of] gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which [are] upon the top thereof:"
Zechariah,4,3,"And two olive trees by it, one upon the right [side] of the bowl, and the other upon the left [side] thereof."
Zechariah,4,4,"So I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What [are] these, my lord?"
Zechariah,4,5,"Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Know you i not what these be? And I said, No, my lord."
Zechariah,4,6,"Then he answered and spoke unto me, saying, This [is] the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto Z’rubavel [sown in Babylon] , saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Zechariah,4,7,"Who [are] you i , O great mountain? before Z’rubavel [sown in Babylon] [you i shall become] a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone [thereof with] shoutings, [crying] , Grace, grace unto it."
Zechariah,4,8,"Moreover the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Zechariah,4,9,The hands of Z’rubavel [sown in Babylon] have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and you i shall know that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] has sent me unto you.
Zechariah,4,10,"For who has despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Z’rubavel [sown in Babylon] [with] those seven; they [are] the eyes of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which run to and fro through the whole earth."
Zechariah,4,11,"Then answered I, and said unto him, What [are] these two olive trees upon the right [side] of the candlestick and upon the left [side] thereof?"
Zechariah,4,12,"And I answered again, and said unto him, What [be these] two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden [oil] out of themselves?"
Zechariah,4,13,"And he answered me and said, Know you i not what these [be] ? And I said, No, my lord."
Zechariah,4,14,"Then said he, These [are] the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord-Adon of the whole earth."
Zechariah,5,1,"Then I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a flying scroll."
Zechariah,5,2,"And he said unto me, What see you i ? And I answered, I see a flying scroll; the length thereof [is] 30 feet, and the breadth thereof fifteen feet."
Zechariah,5,3,"Then said he unto me, This [is] the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth: for everyone that steals shall be cut off [as] on this side according to it; and everyone that swears shall be cut off [as] on that side according to it."
Zechariah,5,4,"I will bring it forth, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that swears falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof."
Zechariah,5,5,"Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now your i eyes, and see what [is] this that goes forth."
Zechariah,5,6,"And I said, What [is] it? And he said, This [is] an eifah that goes forth. He said moreover, This [is] their resemblance through all the earth."
Zechariah,5,7,"And, behold, there was lifted up a talent (weight of money; weight; gift) of lead: and this [is] a woman that sits in the midst of the eifah."
Zechariah,5,8,"And he said, This [is] wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the eifah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof."
Zechariah,5,9,"Then lifted I up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind [was] in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the eifah between the earth and the heaven."
Zechariah,5,10,"Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Where do these bear the eifah?"
Zechariah,5,11,"And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shin’ar [country of two rivers] : and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base."
Zechariah,6,1,"And I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains [were] mountains of brass."
Zechariah,6,2,In the first chariot [were] red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;
Zechariah,6,3,And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled and bay horses.
Zechariah,6,4,"Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What [are] these, my lord?"
Zechariah,6,5,"And the angel answered and said unto me, These [are] the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord-Adon of all the earth."
Zechariah,6,6,The black horses which [are] in it go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grizzled go forth toward the south country.
Zechariah,6,7,"And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth."
Zechariah,6,8,"Then cried he upon me, and spoke unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country."
Zechariah,6,9,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto me, saying,"
Zechariah,6,10,"Take of [them of] the captivity, [even] of Heldai [worldly] , of Toviyah [Yehovah is good] , and of Y’da’yah [Yehovah has known] , which are come from Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and come you i the same day, and go into the house of Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] the son of Tzefan’yahu [Yehovah has treasured];"
Zechariah,6,11,"Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set [them] upon the head of Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Y’hotzadak [Yehovah is righteous] , the High Priest;"
Zechariah,6,12,"And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaks the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , saying, Behold the man whose name [is] The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):"
Zechariah,6,13,"Even he shall build the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both."
Zechariah,6,14,"And the crowns shall be to Helem [strength or dream] , and to Toviyah [Yehovah is good] , and to Y’da’yah [Yehovah has known] , and to Hen the son of Tzefan’yahu [Yehovah has treasured] , for a memorial in the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Zechariah,6,15,"And they [that are] far off shall come and build in the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and you 2f shall know that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] has sent me unto you. And [this] shall come to pass, if you 2f will diligently obey the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Zechariah,7,1,"And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Daryavesh (Darius) [lord], [that] the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers] in the fourth [day] of the ninth month, [even] in Kislev [his confidence];"
Zechariah,7,2,"When they had sent unto the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] Sar’etzer [prince of fire] and Regem-Melekh [king’s heap] , and their men, to pray before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate),"
Zechariah,7,3," [And] to speak unto the priests which [were] in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?"
Zechariah,7,4,"Then came the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] unto me, saying,"
Zechariah,7,5,"Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When you 2f fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh [month] , even those seventy years, did you 2f at all fast unto me, [even] to me?"
Zechariah,7,6,"And when you 2f did eat, and when you 2f did drink, did not you 2f eat [for yourselves] , and drink [for yourselves]?"
Zechariah,7,7," [Should you 2f ] not [hear] the words which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has cried by the former prophets, when Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when [men] inhabited the south and the plain?"
Zechariah,7,8,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers] , saying,"
Zechariah,7,9,"Thus speaks the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , saying, Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassions every man to his brother:"
Zechariah,7,10,"And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart."
Zechariah,7,11,"But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear."
Zechariah,7,12,"Yes, they made their hearts [as] an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] has sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Zechariah,7,13,"Therefore it is come to pass, [that] as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]:"
Zechariah,7,14,"But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate."
Zechariah,8,1,"Again the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] came [to me] , saying,"
Zechariah,8,2,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; I was jealous for Tziyon [parched place] with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury."
Zechariah,8,3,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; I am returned unto Tziyon [parched place] , and will dwell in the midst of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] the holy mountain."
Zechariah,8,4,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and every man with his staff in his hand for very age."
Zechariah,8,5,And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.
Zechariah,8,6,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; If it be marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes? says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Zechariah,8,7,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;"
Zechariah,8,8,"And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : and they shall be my people, and I will be their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , in tand in righteousness."
Zechariah,8,9,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; Let your hands be strong, you 2f that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which [were] in the day [that] the foundation of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] was laid, that the temple might be built."
Zechariah,8,10,"For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither [was there any] peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men everyone against his neighbour."
Zechariah,8,11,"But now I [will] not [be] unto the residue (part that remains, the rest) of this people as in the former days, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Zechariah,8,12,"For the seed [shall be] prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these [things]."
Zechariah,8,13,"And it shall come to pass, [that] as you 2f were a curse among the heathen, O house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; so will I save you, and you 2f shall be a blessing: fear not, [but] let your hands be strong."
Zechariah,8,14,"For thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , and I repented not:"
Zechariah,8,15,So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] and to the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] : fear you 2f not.
Zechariah,8,16,These [are] the things that you 2f shall do; Speak you 2f every man the tto his neighbour; execute the judgment of tand peace in your gates:
Zechariah,8,17,"And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these [are things] that I hate, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Zechariah,8,18,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] came unto me, saying,"
Zechariah,8,19,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; The fast of the fourth [month] , and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the tand peace."
Zechariah,8,20,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]; [It shall] yet [come to pass] , that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:"
Zechariah,8,21,"And the inhabitants of one [city] shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and to seek the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] : I will go also."
Zechariah,8,22,"Yes, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and to pray before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Zechariah,8,23,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; In those days [it shall come to pass] , that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is Jewish (Y’hudi), saying, We will go with you: for we have heard [that] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is] with you."
Zechariah,9,1,"The burden of the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in the land of Hadrakh [dwelling] , and Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] [shall be] the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [shall be] toward the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Zechariah,9,2,"And Hamat [Fortress] also shall border thereby; Tzor (Tyrus) [a rock] , and Tzidon [Hunting] , though it be very wise."
Zechariah,9,3,"And Tzor (Tyrus) [a rock] did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets."
Zechariah,9,4,"Behold, the Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All] will cast her out, and he will strike her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire."
Zechariah,9,5,"Ashkelon [The Fire of Infamy: I shall be Weighed] shall see [it] , and fear; ‘Azah [The Strong] also [shall see it] , and be very sorrowful, and ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots] ; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from ‘Azah [The Strong] , and Ashkelon [The Fire of Infamy: I shall be Weighed] shall not be inhabited."
Zechariah,9,6,"And a child of incest shall dwell in Ashdod [powerful] , and I will cut off the pride of the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."
Zechariah,9,7,"And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remains, even he, [shall be] for our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and he shall be as a governor in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots] as a Y’vusi [Threshers]."
Zechariah,9,8,"And I will encamp about my house because of the army, because of him that passes by, and because of him that returns: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with my eyes."
Zechariah,9,9,"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Tziyon [parched place] ; shout, O daughter of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : behold, your i King comes unto you i : he [is] just, and having Salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass."
Zechariah,9,10,"And I will cut off the chariot from Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , and the horse from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion [shall be] from sea [even] to sea, and from the river [even] to the ends of the earth."
Zechariah,9,11,"As for you i also, by the blood of your i covenant I have sent forth your i prisoners out of the pit wherein [is] no water."
Zechariah,9,12,"Turn you to the strong hold, you 2f prisoners of hope: even today do I declare [that] I will render double unto you i;"
Zechariah,9,13,"When I have bent Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] for me, filled the bow with Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , and raised up you i sons, O Tziyon [parched place] , against you i sons, O Greece, and made you i as the sword of a mighty man."
Zechariah,9,14,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south."
Zechariah,9,15,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, [and] make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, [and] as the corners of the altar."
Zechariah,9,16,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they [shall be as] the stones of a crown, lifted up as an flag (or banner; as of an army) upon his land."
Zechariah,9,17,"For how great [is] his goodness, and how great [is] his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and New Wine the maids."
Zechariah,10,1,"Ask you 2f of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) rain in the time of the latter rain; [so] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to everyone grass in the field."
Zechariah,10,2,"For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because [there was] no shepherd."
Zechariah,10,3,"Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] has visited his flock the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and has made them as his goodly horse in the battle."
Zechariah,10,4,"Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together."
Zechariah,10,5,"And they shall be as mighty [men] , which trample down [their enemies] in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded."
Zechariah,10,6,"And I will strengthen the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and I will save the house of Yosef [(God) He Shall Add] , and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and will hear them."
Zechariah,10,7,"And [they of] Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] shall be like a mighty [man] , and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yes, their children shall see [it] , and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Zechariah,10,8,"I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased."
Zechariah,10,9,"And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again."
Zechariah,10,10,"I will bring them again also out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and gather them out of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) ; and I will bring them into the land of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] and L’vanon [Whiteness] ; and [place] shall not be found for them."
Zechariah,10,11,"And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall strike the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) shall be brought down, and the scepter of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] shall depart away."
Zechariah,10,12,"And I will strengthen them in the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and they shall walk up and down in his name, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Zechariah,11,1,"Open your i doors, O L’vanon [Whiteness] , that the fire may devour your i cedars."
Zechariah,11,2,"Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O you 2f oaks of Bashan [Fruitful] ; for the forest of the vintage is come down."
Zechariah,11,3, [There is] a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Yarden [Descender] is spoiled.
Zechariah,11,4,Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; Feed the flock of the slaughter;
Zechariah,11,5,"Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not."
Zechariah,11,6,"For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : but, lo, I will deliver the men everyone into his neighbour’s hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall strike the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver [them]."
Zechariah,11,7,"And I will feed the flock of slaughter, [even] you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two rods (clubs) ; the one I called [No’am] Beauty, and the other I called [Hovalim] Bound Together; and I fed the flock."
Zechariah,11,8,"Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me."
Zechariah,11,9,"Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dies, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat everyone the flesh of another."
Zechariah,11,10,"And I took my staff, [even] Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people."
Zechariah,11,11,And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it [was] the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
Zechariah,11,12,"And I said unto them, If you 2f think good, give [me] my price; and if not, refrain (restrain; refrein from acting) . So they weighed for my price thirty [pieces] of silver."
Zechariah,11,13,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prized at of them. And I took the thirty [pieces] of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Zechariah,11,14,"Then I cut asunder my other staff, [even] Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Zechariah,11,15,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto me, Take unto yourselfi yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd."
Zechariah,11,16,"For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, [which] shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that stands still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces."
Zechariah,11,17,"Woe to the idol shepherd that leaves the flock! the sword [shall be] upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened."
Zechariah,12,1,"The burden of the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) for Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him."
Zechariah,12,2,"Behold, I will make Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] [and] against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Zechariah,12,3,"And in that day will I make Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it."
Zechariah,12,4,"In that day, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , I will strike every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open my eyes upon the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and will strike every horse of the people with blindness."
Zechariah,12,5,"And the governors of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] [shall be] my strength in the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Zechariah,12,6,"In that day will I make the governors of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] shall be inhabited again in her own place, [even] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Zechariah,12,7,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) also shall save the tents of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] first, that the glory of the house of David [beloved] and the glory of the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] do not magnify [themselves] against Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
Zechariah,12,8,"In that day shall the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) defend the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David [beloved] ; and the house of David [beloved] [shall be] as God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , as the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) before them."
Zechariah,12,9,"And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Zechariah,12,10,"And I will pour upon the house of David [beloved] , and upon the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for [his] only [son] , and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for [his] firstborn."
Zechariah,12,11,"In that day shall there be a great mourning in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , as the mourning of Hadad-Rimmon [Hadad of the pomegranates] in the valley of Megiddo [Place of Crowds] n."
Zechariah,12,12,"And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David [beloved] apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Natan [giver] apart, and their wives apart;"
Zechariah,12,13,"The family of the house of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shime’i [Fame] apart, and their wives apart;"
Zechariah,12,14,"All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart."
Zechariah,13,1,In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David [beloved] and to the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] for sin and for uncleanness.
Zechariah,13,2,"And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies], [that] I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land."
Zechariah,13,3,"And it shall come to pass, [that] when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) him shall say unto him, you i shall not live; for you i speak lies in the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and his father and his mother that begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) him shall thrust him through when he prophesies."
Zechariah,13,4,"And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he has prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:"
Zechariah,13,5,"But he shall say, I [am] no prophet, I [am] an farmer; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth."
Zechariah,13,6,"And [one] shall say unto him, What [are] these wounds in your i hands? Then he shall answer, [Those] with which I was wounded [in] the house of my friends."
Zechariah,13,7,"Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man [that is] my fellow, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] : strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn my hand upon the little ones."
Zechariah,13,8,"And it shall come to pass, [that] in all the land, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , two parts in it shall be cut off [and] die; but the third shall be left in it."
Zechariah,13,9,"And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on My Name, and I will hear them: I will say, It [is] my people: and they shall say, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Zechariah,14,1,"Behold, the day of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) comes, and you i spoil (plunder; prey; booty) shall be divided in the midst of you i."
Zechariah,14,2,"For I will gather all nations against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue (part that remains, the rest) of the people shall not be cut off from the city."
Zechariah,14,3,"Then shall the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle."
Zechariah,14,4,"And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which [is] before Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave (split open; cut open; divide) in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, [and there shall be] a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south."
Zechariah,14,5,"And you 2f shall flee [to] the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Atzel [proximity: he has reserved]: yes, you 2f shall flee, like as you 2f fled from before the earthquake in the days of ‘Uziyah [my strength is Yehovah] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] : and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shall come, [and] all the saints with you i."
Zechariah,14,6,"And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the light shall not be clear, [nor] dark:"
Zechariah,14,7,"But it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, [that] at evening time it shall be light."
Zechariah,14,8,"And it shall be in that day, [that] living waters shall go out from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be."
Zechariah,14,9,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and his name one."
Zechariah,14,10,"All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geva [hill] to Rimmon [Pomegranate] south of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] ’s gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and [from] the tower of Hanan’el [God is favoured] unto the king’s winepresses."
Zechariah,14,11,"And [men] shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] shall be safely inhabited."
Zechariah,14,12,"And this shall be the plague which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will strike all the people that have fought against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth."
Zechariah,14,13,"And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] a great tumult from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall be among them; and they shall lay hold everyone on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour."
Zechariah,14,14,"And Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] also shall fight at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance."
Zechariah,14,15,"And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague."
Zechariah,14,16,"And it shall come to pass, [that] everyone that is left of all the nations which came against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , and to keep the feast of tabernacles."
Zechariah,14,17,"And it shall be, [that] whoso will not come up of [all] the families of the earth unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to worship the King, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , even upon them shall be no rain."
Zechariah,14,18,"And if the family of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] go not up, and come not, that [have] no [rain] ; there shall be the plague, which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will strike the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles."
Zechariah,14,19,"This shall be the punishment of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles."
Zechariah,14,20,"In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and the pots in the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] house shall be like the bowls before the altar."
Zechariah,14,21,"Yes, every pot in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] and in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] shall be holiness unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] : and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe in it: and in that day there shall be no more the Kena’ani [Merchants] in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
