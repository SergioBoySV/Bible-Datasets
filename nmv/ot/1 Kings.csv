1 Kings,1,1,"Now king David [beloved] was old [and] stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat."
1 Kings,1,2,"For what reason his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in your i bosom, that my lord the king may get heat."
1 Kings,1,3,"So they sought for a fair girl throughout all the coasts of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and found Avishag [my father is a wanderer] a Shunamit [double resting place] , and brought her to the king."
1 Kings,1,4,"And the girl [was] very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not."
1 Kings,1,5,"Then Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] the son of Haggit [festive] exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him."
1 Kings,1,6,"And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why have you i done so? and he also [was a] very goodly [man] ; and [his mother] bore him after Avshalom [my father is peace]."
1 Kings,1,7,"And he conferred with Yo’av [Yehovah is father] the son of Tz’ruyah [balsam] , and with Avyatar [my father is great] the priest: and they following Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] helped [him]."
1 Kings,1,8,"But Tzadok [righteous] the priest, and B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] , and Natan [giver] the prophet, and Shime’i [Fame] , and Re’i [friendly] , and the mighty men which [belonged] to David [beloved] , were not with Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah]."
1 Kings,1,9,"And Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] killed sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zochelet [serpent] , which [is] by ‘Ein-Rogel (a place near Jerusalem) [Fount of the Fuller (washer and/or bleacher of clothes)] , and called all his brethren the king’s sons, and all the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] the king’s servants:"
1 Kings,1,10,"But Natan [giver] the prophet, and B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] , and the mighty men, and Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] his brother, he called not."
1 Kings,1,11,"For what reason Natan [giver] spoke unto Bat-Sheva [daughter of an oath] the mother of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , saying, Have you i not heard that Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] the son of Haggit [festive] does reign, and David [beloved] our lord knows [it] not?"
1 Kings,1,12,"Now therefore come, let me, I pray you i , give your i counsel, that you i may save your i own life, and the life of your i son Shlomo (Solomon) [peace]."
1 Kings,1,13,"Go and get you i in unto king David [beloved] , and say unto him, Didst not you i , my lord, O king, swear unto you i female servant, saying, Assuredly Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] your i son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then does Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] reign?"
1 Kings,1,14,"Behold, while you i yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after you i , and confirm your i words."
1 Kings,1,15,And Bat-Sheva [daughter of an oath] went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Avishag [my father is a wanderer] the Shunamit [double resting place] ministered unto the king.
1 Kings,1,16,"And Bat-Sheva [daughter of an oath] bowed, and did obesiance (bowing or kneeling in respect) unto the king. And the king said, What would you i?"
1 Kings,1,17,"And she said unto him, My lord, you i swore by the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] unto your i female servant, [saying] , Assuredly Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] your i son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne."
1 Kings,1,18,"And now, behold, Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] reigns; and now, my lord the king, you i know [it] not:"
1 Kings,1,19,"And he has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Avyatar [my father is great] the priest, and Yo’av [Yehovah is father] the captain of the host: but Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] your i servant has he not called."
1 Kings,1,20,"And you i , my lord, O king, the eyes of all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [are] upon you i , that you i should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him."
1 Kings,1,21,"Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] shall be counted offenders."
1 Kings,1,22,"And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Natan [giver] the prophet also came in."
1 Kings,1,23,"And they told the king, saying, Behold Natan [giver] the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground."
1 Kings,1,24,"And Natan [giver] said, My lord, O king, have you i said, Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?"
1 Kings,1,25,"For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Avyatar [my father is great] the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, Long live king Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah]!"
1 Kings,1,26,"But me, [even] me your i servant, and Tzadok [righteous] the priest, and B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] , and your i servant Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , has he not called."
1 Kings,1,27,"Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you i have not showed [it] unto your i servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"
1 Kings,1,28,"Then king David [beloved] answered and said, Call me Bat-Sheva [daughter of an oath] . And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king."
1 Kings,1,29,"And the king swore, and said, [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, that has redeemed my soul out of all distress,"
1 Kings,1,30,"Even as I swore unto you i by the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, Assuredly Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] your i son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day."
1 Kings,1,31,"Then Bat-Sheva [daughter of an oath] bowed with [her] face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David [beloved] live forever."
1 Kings,1,32,"And king David [beloved] said, Call me Tzadok [righteous] the priest, and Natan [giver] the prophet, and B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] . And they came before the king."
1 Kings,1,33,"The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] my son to ride upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gikhon (Bursting Forth):"
1 Kings,1,34,"And let Tzadok [righteous] the priest and Natan [giver] the prophet anoint him there king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and blow you 2f with the trumpet, and say, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] save king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace]."
1 Kings,1,35,"Then you 2f shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and over Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
1 Kings,1,36,"And B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] answered the king, and said, Amen: the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of my lord the king say so [too]."
1 Kings,1,37,"As the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has been with my lord the king, even so be he with Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David [beloved]."
1 Kings,1,38,"So Tzadok [righteous] the priest, and Natan [giver] the prophet, and B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] , and the K’reti [executioners] , and the P’leti [couriers] , went down, and caused Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] to ride upon king David’s [beloved] ’s mule, and brought him to Gikhon (Bursting Forth)."
1 Kings,1,39,"And Tzadok [righteous] the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] . And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] save king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace]."
1 Kings,1,40,"And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them."
1 Kings,1,41,"And Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] and all the guests that [were] with him heard [it] as they had made an end of eating. And when Yo’av [Yehovah is father] heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, For what reason [is this] noise of the city being in an uproar?"
1 Kings,1,42,"And while he yet spoke, behold, Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] the son of Avyatar [my father is great] the priest came: and Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] said unto him, Come in; for you i [are] a valiant man, and brings good tidings."
1 Kings,1,43,"And Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] answered and said to Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] , Truly our lord king David [beloved] has made Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] king."
1 Kings,1,44,"And the king has sent with him Tzadok [righteous] the priest, and Natan [giver] the prophet, and B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] , and the K’reti [executioners] , and the P’leti [couriers] , and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule:"
1 Kings,1,45,"And Tzadok [righteous] the priest and Natan [giver] the prophet have anointed him king in Gikhon (Bursting Forth) : and they are come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This [is] the noise that you 2f have heard."
1 Kings,1,46,And also Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] sits on the throne of the kingdom.
1 Kings,1,47,"And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David [beloved] , saying, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] make the name of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] better than you i name, and make his throne greater than you i throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed."
1 Kings,1,48,"And also thus said the king, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which has given [one] to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing [it]."
1 Kings,1,49,"And all the guests that [were] with Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way."
1 Kings,1,50,"And Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] feared because of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar."
1 Kings,1,51,"And it was told Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , saying, Behold, Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] fears king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] : for, lo, he has caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword."
1 Kings,1,52,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to (to do entirely, do wholly) the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die."
1 Kings,1,53,"So king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] : and Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] said unto him, Go to your i house."
1 Kings,2,1,"Now the days of David [beloved] drew near that he should die; and he charged Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] his son, saying,"
1 Kings,2,2,"I go the way of all the earth: be you i strong therefore, and show yourself a man;"
1 Kings,2,3,"And keep the charge of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , that you i may prosper in all that you i do, and to wherever you i turn yourself:"
1 Kings,2,4,"That the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) may continue his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If you i children take heed to their way, to walk before me in twith all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you i (said he) a man on the throne of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Kings,2,5,"Moreover you i know also what Yo’av [Yehovah is father] the son of Tz’ruyah [balsam] did to me, [and] what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , unto Avner [my father is a lamp] the son of Ner [lamp] , and unto ‘Amasa [burden] the son of Yeter [abundance] , whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his belt that [was] about his waist, and in his shoes that [were] on his feet."
1 Kings,2,6,"Do therefore according to your i wisdom, and let not his grey head go down to the grave in peace."
1 Kings,2,7,"But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai [my iron] the Gil’adi [Hill of Testimony] , and let them be of those that eat at you i table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Avshalom [my father is peace] your i brother."
1 Kings,2,8,"And, behold, [you i have] with you i Shime’i [Fame] the son of Gera [A Grain] , from the tribe of Binyamin [A Son of the Right Hand] of Bachurim [young men’s Villiage] , which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Machanayim [Two Camps] : but he came down to meet me at Yarden [Descender] , and I swore to him by the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, I will not put you i to death with the sword."
1 Kings,2,9,"Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for you i [are] a wise man, and know what you i ought to do unto him; but his grey head bring you i down to the grave with blood."
1 Kings,2,10,"So David [beloved] slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David [beloved]."
1 Kings,2,11,"And the days that David [beloved] reigned over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [were] forty years: seven years reigned he in Hevron [Seat of Association] , and thirty and three years reigned he in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
1 Kings,2,12,Then sat Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] upon the throne of David [beloved] his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
1 Kings,2,13,"And Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] the son of Haggit [festive] came to Bat-Sheva [daughter of an oath] the mother of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] . And she said, Come you i peaceably? And he said, Peaceably."
1 Kings,2,14,"He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto you i . And she said, Say on."
1 Kings,2,15,"And he said, you i know that the kingdom was my, and [that] all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Kings,2,16,"And now I ask one petition of you i , deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on."
1 Kings,2,17,"And he said, Speak, I pray you i , unto Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] the king, (for he will not say you i No,) that he give me Avishag [my father is a wanderer] the Shunamit [double resting place] to wife."
1 Kings,2,18,"And Bat-Sheva [daughter of an oath] said, Well; I will speak for you i unto the king."
1 Kings,2,19,"Bat-Sheva [daughter of an oath] therefore went unto king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , to speak unto him for Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] . And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand."
1 Kings,2,20,"Then she said, I desire one small petition of you i; [I pray you i ] , say me not No. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say you i No."
1 Kings,2,21,"And she said, Let Avishag [my father is a wanderer] the Shunamit [double resting place] be given to Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] your i brother to wife."
1 Kings,2,22,"And king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] answered and said unto his mother, And why do you i ask Avishag [my father is a wanderer] the Shunamit [double resting place] for Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] ? ask for him the kingdom also; for he [is] my elder brother; even for him, and for Avyatar [my father is great] the priest, and for Yo’av [Yehovah is father] the son of Tz’ruyah [balsam]."
1 Kings,2,23,"Then king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] swore by the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] do so to me, and more also, if Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] have not spoken this word against his own life."
1 Kings,2,24,"Now therefore, [as] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, which has established me, and set me on the throne of David [beloved] my father, and who has made me an house, as he promised, Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] shall be put to death this day."
1 Kings,2,25,And king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] sent by the hand of B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] ; and he fell upon him that he died.
1 Kings,2,26,"And unto Avyatar [my father is great] the priest said the king, Get you i to ‘Anatot [answers to prayer] , unto your i own fields; for you i [are] worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you i to death, because you i barest the ark of the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) before David [beloved] my father, and because you i have been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted."
1 Kings,2,27,"So Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] thrust out Avyatar [my father is great] from being priest unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; that he might fulfill the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he spoke concerning the house of ‘Eli [ascension] in Shiloh [Place of Rest]."
1 Kings,2,28,"Then tidings came to Yo’av [Yehovah is father] : for Yo’av [Yehovah is father] had turned after Adoniyah [my lord is Yehovah] , though he turned not after Avshalom [my father is peace] . And Yo’av [Yehovah is father] fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and caught hold on the horns of the altar."
1 Kings,2,29,"And it was told king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] that Yo’av [Yehovah is father] was fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and, behold, [he is] by the altar. Then Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] sent B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] , saying, Go, fall upon him."
1 Kings,2,30,"And B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] came to the tabernacle of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said unto him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And he said, No; but I will die here. And B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , and thus he answered me."
1 Kings,2,31,"And the king said unto him, Do as he has said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that you i may take away the innocent blood, which Yo’av [Yehovah is father] shed, from me, and from the house of my father."
1 Kings,2,32,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword, my father David [beloved] not knowing [thereof, that is to say] , Avner [my father is a lamp] the son of Ner [lamp] , captain of the host of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and ‘Amasa [burden] the son of Yeter [abundance] , captain of the host of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
1 Kings,2,33,"Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Yo’av [Yehovah is father] , and upon the head of his seed forever: but upon David [beloved] , and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace forever from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Kings,2,34,"So B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] went up, and fell upon him, and killed him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness."
1 Kings,2,35,And the king put B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] in his room over the host: and Tzadok [righteous] the priest did the king put in the room of Avyatar [my father is great].
1 Kings,2,36,"And the king sent and called for Shime’i [Fame] , and said unto him, Build you i an house in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and dwell there, and go not forth there any to which."
1 Kings,2,37,"For it shall be, [that] on the day you i go out, and pass over the brook Kidron [dark] , you i shall know for certain that you i shall surely die: your i blood shall be upon your i own head."
1 Kings,2,38,"And Shime’i [Fame] said unto the king, The saying [is] good: as my lord the king has said, so will your i servant do. And Shime’i [Fame] dwelt in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] many days."
1 Kings,2,39,"And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shime’i [Fame] ran away unto Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man] son of Ma’akhah [oppression] king of Gat [Winepress] . And they told Shime’i [Fame] , saying, Behold, your i servants [be] in Gat [Winepress]."
1 Kings,2,40,"And Shime’i [Fame] arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gat [Winepress] to Akhish [meaning disputed; I will blacken (or terrify) or only a man] to seek his servants: and Shime’i [Fame] went, and brought his servants from Gat [Winepress]."
1 Kings,2,41,"And it was told Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] that Shime’i [Fame] had gone from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to Gat [Winepress] , and was come again."
1 Kings,2,42,"And the king sent and called for Shime’i [Fame] , and said unto him, Did I not make you i to swear by the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and protested unto you i , saying, Know for a certain, on the day you i go out, and walk abroad any to which, that you i shall surely die? and you i said unto me, The word [that] I have heard [is] good."
1 Kings,2,43,"Why then have you i not kept the oath of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the commandment that I have charged you i with?"
1 Kings,2,44,"The king said moreover to Shime’i [Fame] , you i know all the wickedness which your i heart is privy (knowing a secret) to, that you i did to David [beloved] my father: therefore the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall return your i wickedness upon your i own head;"
1 Kings,2,45,"And king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] [shall be] Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) , and the throne of David [beloved] shall be established before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) forever."
1 Kings,2,46,"So the king commanded B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] ; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace]."
1 Kings,3,1,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] made alliance with Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and took Par’oh’s [Pharaoh - Great House] daughter, and brought her into the city of David [beloved] , until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the wall of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] round about."
1 Kings,3,2,"Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , until those days."
1 Kings,3,3,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] loved the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , walking in the statutes of David [beloved] his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places."
1 Kings,3,4,And the king went to Giv’on [Hill City] to sacrifice there; for that [was] the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] offer upon that altar.
1 Kings,3,5,"In Giv’on [Hill City] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) appeared to Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] in a dream by night: and God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] said, Ask what I shall give you i."
1 Kings,3,6,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] said, you i have showed unto you i servant David [beloved] my father great mercy, according as he walked before you i in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you i ; and you i have kept for him this great kindness, that you i have given him a son to sit on his throne, as [it is] this day."
1 Kings,3,7,"And now, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , you i have made you i servant king instead of David [beloved] my father: and I [am but] a little child: I know not [how] to go out or come in."
1 Kings,3,8,"And your i servant [is] in the midst of your i people which you i have chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude."
1 Kings,3,9,"Give therefore your i servant an understanding heart to judge your i people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this your i so great a people?"
1 Kings,3,10,"And the speech pleased the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] , that Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] had asked this thing."
1 Kings,3,11,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] said unto him, Because you i have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life; neither have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your i enemies; but have asked for yourself understanding to discern judgment;"
1 Kings,3,12,"Behold, I have done according to your i words: lo, I have given you i a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like you i before you i , neither after you i shall any arise like unto you i."
1 Kings,3,13,"And I have also given you i that which you i have not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto you i all your i days."
1 Kings,3,14,"And if you i will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as your i father David [beloved] did walk, then I will lengthen your i days."
1 Kings,3,15,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] awoke; and, behold, [it was] a dream. And he came to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] , and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants."
1 Kings,3,16,"Then came there two women, [that were] prostitutes, unto the king, and stood before him."
1 Kings,3,17,"And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house."
1 Kings,3,18,"And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we [were] together; [there was] no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house."
1 Kings,3,19,And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
1 Kings,3,20,"And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while your i female servant slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom."
1 Kings,3,21,"And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear."
1 Kings,3,22,"And the other woman said, No; but the living [is] my son, and the dead [is] your i son. And this said, No; but the dead [is] your i son, and the living [is] my son. Thus they spoke before the king."
1 Kings,3,23,"Then said the king, The one says, This [is] my son that lives, and your i son [is] the dead: and the other says, No; but your i son [is] the dead, and my son [is] the living."
1 Kings,3,24,"And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king."
1 Kings,3,25,"And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other."
1 Kings,3,26,"Then spoke the woman whose the living child [was] unto the king, for her bowels (inward parts; affections) yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no way slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither my nor your i, [but] divide [it]."
1 Kings,3,27,"Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and assuredly not (by no means) slay it: she [is] the mother thereof."
1 Kings,3,28,"And all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [was] in him, to do judgment."
1 Kings,4,1,So king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] was king over all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
1 Kings,4,2,"And these [were] the princes which he had; ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] the son of Tzadok [righteous] the priest,"
1 Kings,4,3,"Elichoref [God of winter (harvest time)] and Achiyah [brother of Yehovah] , the sons of Shisha [Yehovah contends] , scribes; Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] the son of Achilud [child’s brother] , the recorder."
1 Kings,4,4,And B’nayahu [Yehovah has built] the son of Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] [was] over the host: and Tzadok [righteous] and Avyatar [my father is great] [were] the priests:
1 Kings,4,5,"And ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] the son of Natan [giver] [was] over the officers: and Zavud [given] the son of Natan [giver] [was] principal officer, [and] the king’s friend:"
1 Kings,4,6,And Achishar [my brother sang] [was] over the household: and Adoniram [my lord is exalted] the son of ‘Avda [servant of Yehovah] [was] over the tribute.
1 Kings,4,7,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] had twelve officers over all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which provided victuals (food for humans) for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision."
1 Kings,4,8,"And these [are] their names: The son of Hur [Liberty] , in mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful]:"
1 Kings,4,9,"The son of Deker [son of stabbing] , in Makatz [end] , and in Sha’alvim [Place of Foxes] , and Beit-Shemesh [House of the Sun] , and Eilon-Beit-Hanan [oak of the house of grace]:"

1 Kings,4,12,"Ba’ana [in the affliction] the son of Achilud [child’s brother]; [to him pertained] Ta’anakh [Sandy] and Megiddo [Place of Crowds] , and all Beit-Sh’an [House of Ease] , which [is] by Tzartan [their distress] beneath Yizre’el [God Sows] , from Beit-Sh’an [House of Ease] to Avel-M’cholah [Meadow of Dancing], [even] unto [the place that is] beyond Yokne’am [The People Lament]:"
1 Kings,4,13,"The son of Gever [the Son of man] , in Ramot-Gil’ad [rocky region] ; to him [pertained] the towns of Ya’ir [He Enlightens] the son of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , which [are] in Gil’ad [Rocky Region] ; to him [also pertained] the region of Argov [Heap of Clods] , which [is] in Bashan [Fruitful] , threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars:"
1 Kings,4,14,Ahinadav [Generous] the son of ‘Iddo [His witness] [had] Machanayim [Two Camps]:
1 Kings,4,15,Achima’atz [my brother is anger (wrath)] [was] in Naftali [My Wrestling] ; he also took Basmat [spice] the daughter of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] to wife:
1 Kings,4,16,Ba’anah [in affliction] the son of Hushai [hasting] [was] in Asher [Happy] and in Alot [mistresses]:

1 Kings,4,20,"Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [were] many, as the sand which [is] by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry."
1 Kings,4,21,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and unto the border of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : they brought presents, and served Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] all the days of his life."
1 Kings,4,22,"And Shlomo’s (Solomon) [peace] provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,"
1 Kings,4,23,"Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow (to approve, commend, accept) deer, and fatted fowl."
1 Kings,4,24,"For he had dominion over all [the region] on this side the river, from Tifsach [cross over] even to ‘Azah [The Strong] , over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him."
1 Kings,4,25,"And Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan [Judge] even to Be’er-sheva [Well of the sevenfold Oath] , all the days of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace]."
1 Kings,4,26,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen."
1 Kings,4,27,"And those officers provided victual for king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , and for all that came unto king Shlomo’s (Solomon) [peace] table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing."
1 Kings,4,28,"Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where [the officers] were, every man according to his charge."
1 Kings,4,29,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] gave Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that [is] on the sea shore."
1 Kings,4,30,"And Shlomo’s (Solomon) [peace] wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
1 Kings,4,31,"For he was wiser than all men; than Eitan [enduring] the Ezrachi [a native (as arising out of the soil)] , and Heiman [faithful] , and Kalkol [sustaining] , and Darda [pearl of knowledge] , the sons of Machol [dancing] : and his fame was in all nations round about."
1 Kings,4,32,And he spoke three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.
1 Kings,4,33,"And he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that [is] in L’vanon [Whiteness] even unto the hyssop that springs out of the wall: he spoke also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes."
1 Kings,4,34,"And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom."
1 Kings,5,1,And Hiram [noble] king of Tzor (Tyre) [a rock] sent his servants unto Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] ; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram [noble] was ever a lover of David [beloved].
1 Kings,5,2,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] sent to Hiram [noble] , saying,"
1 Kings,5,3,"you i know how that David [beloved] my father could not build an house unto the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] for the wars which were about him on every side, until the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) put them under the soles of his feet."
1 Kings,5,4,"But now the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has given me rest on every side, [so that there is] neither adversary nor evil evident."
1 Kings,5,5,"And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto David [beloved] my father, saying, Your 1s son, whom I will set upon your i throne in your i room, he shall build an house unto my name."
1 Kings,5,6,Now therefore command you i that they hew me cedar trees out of L’vanon [Whiteness] ; and my servants shall be with your i servants: and unto you i will I give wages for your i servants according to all that you i shall appoint: for you i know that [there is] not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Tzidonim [Hunting].
1 Kings,5,7,"And it came to pass, when Hiram [noble] heard the words of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) this day, which has given unto David [beloved] a wise son over this great people."
1 Kings,5,8,"And Hiram [noble] sent to Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , saying, I have considered the things which you i sent to me for: [and] I will do all your i desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir."
1 Kings,5,9,"My servants shall bring [them] down from L’vanon [Whiteness] unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that you i shall appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and you i shall receive [them] : and you i shall accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household."
1 Kings,5,10,So Hiram [noble] gave Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] cedar trees and fir trees [according to] all his desire.
1 Kings,5,11,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] gave Hiram [noble] twenty thousand measures of wheat [for] food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] to Hiram [noble] year by year."
1 Kings,5,12,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) gave Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram [noble] and Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] ; and they two made a league (a covenant or compact made between persons, parties, states, etc., for the promotion or maintenance of common interests or for mutual assistance or service.) together."
1 Kings,5,13,And king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] raised a levy out of all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
1 Kings,5,14,"And he sent them to L’vanon [Whiteness] , ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in L’vanon [Whiteness], [and] two months at home: and Adoniram [my lord is exalted] [was] over the levy."
1 Kings,5,15,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] had threescore and ten thousand that bore burdens, and eighty thousand hewers in the mountains;"
1 Kings,5,16,"Beside the chief of Shlomo’s (Solomon) [peace] officers which [were] over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work."
1 Kings,5,17,"And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, [and] hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house."
1 Kings,5,18,"And Shlomo’s (Solomon) [peace] builders and Hiram [noble] ’s builders did hew [them] , and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house."
1 Kings,6,1,"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were come out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , in the fourth year of Shlomo’s (Solomon) [peace] reign over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , in the month Ziv [brightness] , which [is] the second month, that he began to build the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Kings,6,2,"And the house which king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] built for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the length thereof [was] threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty [cubits] , and the height thereof thirty cubits."
1 Kings,6,3,"And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits [was] the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; [and] ten cubits [was] the breadth thereof before the house."
1 Kings,6,4,And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
1 Kings,6,5,"And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, [against] the walls of the house round about, [both] of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:"
1 Kings,6,6,"The nethermost chamber [was] five cubits broad, and the middle [was] six cubits broad, and the third [was] seven cubits broad: for without [in the wall] of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that [the beams] should not be fastened in the walls of the house."
1 Kings,6,7,"And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought there: so that there was neither hammer nor axe [nor] any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building."
1 Kings,6,8,"The door for the middle chamber [was] in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle [chamber] , and out of the middle into the third."
1 Kings,6,9,"So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar."
1 Kings,6,10,"And [then] he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house [with] timber of cedar."
1 Kings,6,11,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came to Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , saying,"
1 Kings,6,12," [Concerning] this house which you i are in building, if you i will walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with you i , which I spoke unto David [beloved] you i father:"
1 Kings,6,13,"And I will dwell among the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and will not forsake my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Kings,6,14,"So Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] built the house, and finished it."
1 Kings,6,15,"And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: [and] he covered [them] on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir."
1 Kings,6,16,"And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built [them] for it within, [even] for the oracle, [even] for the most holy [place]."
1 Kings,6,17,"And the house, that [is] , the temple before it, was forty cubits [long]."
1 Kings,6,18,And the cedar of the house within [was] carved with knops and open flowers: all [was] cedar; there was no stone seen.
1 Kings,6,19,"And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Kings,6,20,"And the oracle in the forepart [was] twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and [so] covered the altar [which was of] cedar."
1 Kings,6,21,So Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.
1 Kings,6,22,"And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that [was] by the oracle he overlaid with gold."
1 Kings,6,23,"And within the oracle he made two k’vurim (cherubim) [of] olive tree, [each] ten cubits high."
1 Kings,6,24,"And five cubits [was] the one wing of the cherub [keruv] , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub [keruv] : from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other [were] ten cubits."
1 Kings,6,25,And the other cherub [keruv] [was] ten cubits: both the k’vurim (cherubim) [were] of one measure and one size.
1 Kings,6,26,"The height of the one cherub [keruv] [was] ten cubits, and so [was it] of the other cherub [keruv]."
1 Kings,6,27,"And he set the k’vurim (cherubim) within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the k’vurim (cherubim) , so that the wing of the one touched the [one] wall, and the wing of the other cherub [keruv] touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house."
1 Kings,6,28,And he overlaid the k’vurim (cherubim) with gold.
1 Kings,6,29,"And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of k’vurim (cherubim) and palm trees and open flowers, within and without."
1 Kings,6,30,"And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without."
1 Kings,6,31,And for the entering of the oracle he made doors [of] olive tree: the lintel (top of the door frame) [and] side posts [were] a fifth part [of the wall].
1 Kings,6,32,"The two doors also [were of] olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of k’vurim (cherubim) and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid [them] with gold, and spread gold upon the k’vurim (cherubim) , and upon the palm trees."
1 Kings,6,33,"So also made he for the door of the temple posts [of] olive tree, a fourth part [of the wall]."
1 Kings,6,34,"And the two doors [were of] fir tree: the two leaves of the one door [were] folding, and the two leaves of the other door [were] folding."
1 Kings,6,35,And he carved [thereon] k’vurim (cherubim) and palm trees and open flowers: and covered [them] with gold fitted upon the carved work.
1 Kings,6,36,"And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams."
1 Kings,6,37,"In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) laid, in the month Ziv [brightness]:"
1 Kings,6,38,"And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul [increase: produce], which [is] the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it."
1 Kings,7,1,"But Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house."
1 Kings,7,2,"He built also the house of the forest of L’vanon [Whiteness] ; the length thereof [was] an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars."
1 Kings,7,3,"And [it was] covered with cedar above upon the beams, that [lay] on forty five pillars, fifteen [in] a row."
1 Kings,7,4,"And [there were] windows [in] three rows, and light [was] against light [in] three ranks."
1 Kings,7,5,"And all the doors and posts [were] square, with the windows: and light [was] against light [in] three ranks."
1 Kings,7,6,"And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof [was] fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch [was] before them: and the [other] pillars and the thick beam [were] before them."
1 Kings,7,7,"Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, [even] the porch of judgment: and [it was] covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other."
1 Kings,7,8,"And his house where he dwelt [had] another court within the porch, [which] was of the like work. Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] made also an house for Par’oh’s [Pharaoh - Great House] daughter, whom he had taken [to wife] , like unto this porch."
1 Kings,7,9,"All these [were of] costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping (top of a wall, sloped to drain off water) , and [so] on the outside toward the great court."
1 Kings,7,10,"And the foundation [was of] costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits."
1 Kings,7,11,"And above [were] costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars."
1 Kings,7,12,"And the great court round about [was] with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and for the porch of the house."
1 Kings,7,13,And king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] sent and fetched Hiram [noble] out of Tzor [a rock].
1 Kings,7,14,"He [was] a widow’s son of the tribe of Naftali [My Wrestling] , and his father [was] a man of Tzor [a rock] , a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , and wrought all his work."
1 Kings,7,15,"For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass (go around, encircle; encompass) either of them about."
1 Kings,7,16,"And he made two columns [of] molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one column [was] five cubits, and the height of the other column [was] five cubits:"
1 Kings,7,17," [And] nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the columns which [were] upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one column, and seven for the other column."
1 Kings,7,18,"And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the columns that [were] upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other column."
1 Kings,7,19,"And the columns that [were] upon the top of the pillars [were] of lily work in the porch, four cubits."
1 Kings,7,20,"And the columns upon the two pillars [had pomegranates] also above, over against the belly which [was] by the network: and the pomegranates [were] two hundred in rows round about upon the other column."
1 Kings,7,21,"And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Yakhin [He will establish] : and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Bo’az [a high rate of movement]."
1 Kings,7,22,And upon the top of the pillars [was] lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
1 Kings,7,23,"And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: [it was] round all about, and his height [was] five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass (go around, encircle; encompass) it round about."
1 Kings,7,24,"And under the brim of it round about [there were] knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops [were] cast in two rows, when it was cast."
1 Kings,7,25,"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea [was set] above upon them, and all their hinder parts [were] inward."
1 Kings,7,26,"And it [was] an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths."
1 Kings,7,27,"And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits [was] the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it."
1 Kings,7,28,"And the work of the bases [was] on this [manner] : they had borders, and the borders [were] between the ledges:"
1 Kings,7,29,"And on the borders that [were] between the ledges [were] lions, oxen, and k’vurim (cherubim) : and upon the ledges [there was] a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen [were] certain additions made of thin work."
1 Kings,7,30,"And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had supports: under the Wash basin [were] supports molten, at the side of every addition."
1 Kings,7,31,"And the mouth of it within the column and above [was] a cubit: but the mouth thereof [was] round [after] the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it [were] gravings with their borders, Foursquare (squared; four cornered) , not round."
1 Kings,7,32,And under the borders [were] four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels [were joined] to the base: and the height of a wheel [was] a cubit and half a cubit.
1 Kings,7,33,"And the work of the wheels [was] like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, [were] all molten."
1 Kings,7,34,And [there were] four supports to the four corners of one base: [and] the supports [were] of the very base itself.
1 Kings,7,35,"And in the top of the base [was there] a round compass (go around, encircle; encompass) of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof [were] of the same."
1 Kings,7,36,"For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved k’vurim (cherubim) , lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of everyone, and additions round about."
1 Kings,7,37,"After this [manner] he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, [and] one size."
1 Kings,7,38,Then made he ten lavers of brass: one Wash basin contained forty baths: [and] every Wash basin was four cubits: [and] upon everyone of the ten bases one Wash basin.
1 Kings,7,39,"And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south."
1 Kings,7,40,"And Hiram [noble] made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram [noble] made an end of doing all the work that he made king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] for the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):"
1 Kings,7,41,"The two pillars, and the [two] bowls of the columns that [were] on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the columns which [were] upon the top of the pillars;"
1 Kings,7,42,"And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, [even] two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the columns that [were] upon the pillars;"
1 Kings,7,43,"And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;"
1 Kings,7,44,"And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;"
1 Kings,7,45,"And the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: and all these vessels, which Hiram [noble] made to king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] for the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [were of] bright brass."
1 Kings,7,46,"In the plain of Yarden [Descender] did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Sukkot [Booths] and Tzartan [their distress]."
1 Kings,7,47,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] left all the vessels [unweighed] , because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out."
1 Kings,7,48,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] made all the vessels that [pertained] unto the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the showbread [was],"
1 Kings,7,49,"And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right [side] , and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs [of] gold,"
1 Kings,7,50,"And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers [of] pure gold; and the hinges [of] gold, [both] for the doors of the inner house, the most holy [place, and] for the doors of the house, [that is to say] , of the temple."
1 Kings,7,51,"So was ended all the work that king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] made for the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] brought in the things which David [beloved] his father had dedicated; [even] the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Kings,8,1,"Then Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] assembled the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , unto king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) out of the city of David [beloved] , which [is] Tziyon [parched place]."
1 Kings,8,2,"And all the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] assembled themselves unto king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] at the feast in the month Etanim [enduring] , which [is] the seventh month."
1 Kings,8,3,"And all the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came, and the priests took up the ark."
1 Kings,8,4,"And they brought up the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that [were] in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] bring up."
1 Kings,8,5,"And king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , and all the congregation of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that were assembled unto him, [were] with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude."
1 Kings,8,6,"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy [place, even] under the wings of the k’vurim (cherubim)."
1 Kings,8,7,"For the k’vurim (cherubim) spread forth [their] two wings over the place of the ark, and the k’vurim (cherubim) covered the ark and the rods (clubs) thereof above."
1 Kings,8,8,"And they drew out the rods (clubs) , that the ends of the rods (clubs) were seen out in the holy [place] before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day."
1 Kings,8,9," [There was] nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] put there at Horev [Desert] , when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) made [a covenant] with the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , when they came out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
1 Kings,8,10,"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy [place] , that the cloud filled the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate),"
1 Kings,8,11,So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had filled the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
1 Kings,8,12,"Then spoke Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said that he would dwell in the thick darkness."
1 Kings,8,13,"I have surely built you i an house to dwell in, a settled place for you i to abide in forever."
1 Kings,8,14,"And the king turned his face about, and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) all the congregation of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] (and all the congregation of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] stood;)"
1 Kings,8,15,"And he said, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which spoke with his mouth unto David [beloved] my father, and has with his hand fulfilled [it] , saying,"
1 Kings,8,16,"Since the day that I brought forth my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , I chose no city out of all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to build an house, that my name might be in it; but I chose David [beloved] to be over my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Kings,8,17,And it was in the heart of David [beloved] my father to build an house for the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
1 Kings,8,18,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto David [beloved] my father, Whereas it was in you i heart to build an house unto my name, you i did well that it was in you i heart."
1 Kings,8,19,"Nevertheless you i shall not build the house; but your i son that shall come forth out of your i waist, he shall build the house unto my name."
1 Kings,8,20,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has performed his word that he spoke, and I am risen up in the room of David [beloved] my father, and sit on the throne of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) promised, and have built an house for the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Kings,8,21,"And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein [is] the covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
1 Kings,8,22,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] stood before the altar of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in the presence of all the congregation of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and spread forth his hands toward heaven:"
1 Kings,8,23,"And he said, Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [there is] no God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] like you i , in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keeps covenant and mercy with you i servants that walk before you i with all their heart:"
1 Kings,8,24,"Who have kept with your i servant David [beloved] my father that you i promised him: you i spoke also with your i mouth, and have fulfilled [it] with your i hand, as [it is] this day."
1 Kings,8,25,"Therefore now, Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , keep with your i servant David [beloved] my father that you i promised him, saying, There shall not fail you i a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; so that your i children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as you i have walked before me."
1 Kings,8,26,"And now, O God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , let you i word, I pray you i , be verified, which you i spoke unto your i servant David [beloved] my father."
1 Kings,8,27,"But will God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain you i ; how much less this house that I have built?"
1 Kings,8,28,"Yet have you i respect unto the prayer of your i servant, and to his supplication, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which your i servant prays before you i today:"
1 Kings,8,29,"That your i eyes may be open toward this house night and day, [even] toward the place of which you i have said, My name shall be there: that you i may hearken unto the prayer which your i servant shall make toward this place."
1 Kings,8,30,"And hearken you i to the supplication of your i servant, and of your i people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , when they shall pray toward this place: and hear you i in heaven your i dwelling place: and when you i hear, forgive."
1 Kings,8,31,"If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before your i altar in this house:"
1 Kings,8,32,"Then hear you i in heaven, and do, and judge your i servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness."
1 Kings,8,33,"When your i people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you i , and shall turn again to you i , and confess your i name, and pray, and make supplication unto you i in this house:"
1 Kings,8,34,"Then hear you i in heaven, and forgive the sin of your i people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and bring them again unto the land which you i gave unto their fathers."
1 Kings,8,35,"When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you i ; if they pray toward this place, and confess your i name, and turn from their sin, when you i afflict them:"
1 Kings,8,36,"Then hear you i in heaven, and forgive the sin of your i servants, and of your i people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that you i teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon your i land, which you i have given to your i people for an inheritance."
1 Kings,8,37,"If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, [or] if there be caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness [there be];"
1 Kings,8,38,"What prayer and supplication soever be [made] by any man, [or] by all your i people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:"
1 Kings,8,39,"Then hear you i in heaven your i dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart you i know; (for you i, [even] you i only, know the hearts of all the children of men;)"
1 Kings,8,40,That they may fear you i all the days that they live in the land which you i gave unto our fathers.
1 Kings,8,41,"Moreover concerning a stranger, that [is] not of your i people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , but comes out of a far country for your i name’s sake;"
1 Kings,8,42,"(For they shall hear of your i great name, and of you i strong hand, and of your i stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;"
1 Kings,8,43,"Hear you i in heaven your i dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calls to you i for: that all people of the earth may know your i name, to fear you i , as [do] your i people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and that they may know that this house, which I have built, is called by your i name."
1 Kings,8,44,"If your i people go out to battle against their enemy, to wherever you i shall send them, and shall pray unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) toward the city which you i have chosen, and [toward] the house that I have built for your i name:"
1 Kings,8,45,"Then hear you i in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause."
1 Kings,8,46,"If they sin against you i , (for [there is] no man that sins not,) and you i be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;"
1 Kings,8,47," [Yet] if they shall consider themselves in the land to which they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto you i in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;"
1 Kings,8,48,"And [so] return unto you i with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto you i toward their land, which you i gave unto their fathers, the city which you i have chosen, and the house which I have built for your i name:"
1 Kings,8,49,"Then hear you i their prayer and their supplication in heaven your i dwelling place, and maintain their cause,"
1 Kings,8,50,"And forgive your i people that have sinned against you i , and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against you i , and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:"
1 Kings,8,51,"For they [be] your i people, and your i inheritance, which you i brought forth out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , from the midst of the furnace of iron:"
1 Kings,8,52,"That your i eyes may be open unto the supplication of your i servant, and unto the supplication of your i people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto you i."
1 Kings,8,53,"For you i did separate them from among all the people of the earth, [to be] your i inheritance, as you i spoke by the hand of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] your i servant, when you i brought our fathers out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , O Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER)."
1 Kings,8,54,"And it was [so] , that when Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , he arose from before the altar of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven."
1 Kings,8,55,"And he stood, and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) all the congregation of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with a loud voice, saying,"
1 Kings,8,56,"Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that has given rest unto his people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , according to all that he promised: there has not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] his servant."
1 Kings,8,57,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:"
1 Kings,8,58,"That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers."
1 Kings,8,59,"And let these my words, which I have made supplication before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , be near unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] at all times, as the matter shall require:"
1 Kings,8,60,"That all the people of the earth may know that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered], [and that there is] none else."
1 Kings,8,61,"Let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day."
1 Kings,8,62,"And the king, and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with him, offered sacrifice before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Kings,8,63,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] dedicated the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Kings,8,64,"The same day did the king hallow (to approve, commend, accept) the middle of the court that [was] before the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that [was] before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [was] too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings."
1 Kings,8,65,"And at that time Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] held a feast, and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamat [Fortress] unto the river of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , seven days and seven days, [even] fourteen days."
1 Kings,8,66,"On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had done for David [beloved] his servant, and for Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] his people."
1 Kings,9,1,"And it came to pass, when Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] had finished the building of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the king’s house, and all Shlomo’s (Solomon) [peace] desire which he was pleased to do,"
1 Kings,9,2,"That the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) appeared to Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Giv’on [Hill City]."
1 Kings,9,3,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto him, I have heard your i prayer and your i supplication, that you i have made before me: I have consecrated this house, which you i have built, to put my name there forever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually."
1 Kings,9,4,"And if you i will walk before me, as David [beloved] your i father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you i, [and] will keep my statutes and my judgments:"
1 Kings,9,5,"Then I will establish the throne of your i kingdom upon Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] forever, as I promised to David [beloved] your i father, saying, There shall not fail you i a man upon the throne of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Kings,9,6," [But] if you 2f shall at all turn from following me, you 2f or your children, and will not keep my commandments [and] my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:"
1 Kings,9,7,"Then will I cut off Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have consecrated for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:"
1 Kings,9,8,"And at this house, [which] is high, everyone that passes by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why has the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) done thus unto this land, and to this house?"
1 Kings,9,9,"And they shall answer, Because they forsook the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore has the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) brought upon them all this evil."
1 Kings,9,10,"And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] had built the two houses, the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the king’s house,"
1 Kings,9,11,"( [Now] Hiram [noble] the king of Tzor (Tyre) [a rock] had furnished Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] gave Hiram [noble] twenty cities in the land of Galil [circuit, district]."
1 Kings,9,12,And Hiram [noble] came out from Tzor (Tyre) [a rock] to see the cities which Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] had given him; and they pleased him not.
1 Kings,9,13,"And he said, What cities [are] these which you i have given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Kavul [binding] unto this day."
1 Kings,9,14,And Hiram [noble] sent to the king four tons of gold.
1 Kings,9,15,"And this [is] the reason of the levy which king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] raised; for to build the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and his own house, and Millo [fortification (defensive structure) or mound] , and the wall of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and Hatzor [Castle] , and Megiddo [Place of Crowds] , and Gezer [Portion]."
1 Kings,9,16," [For] Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] had gone up, and taken Gezer [Portion] , and burnt it with fire, and slain the Kena’ani [Merchant] that dwelt in the city, and given it [for] a present unto his daughter, Shlomo’s (Solomon) [peace] wife."
1 Kings,9,17,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] built Gezer [Portion] , and Beit-Horon [House of Hollowness] the lower,"
1 Kings,9,18,"And Ba’alat [mistress] , and Tadmor [palm tree] in the wilderness, in the land,"
1 Kings,9,19,"And all the cities of store that Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] desired to build in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and in L’vanon [Whiteness] , and in all the land of his dominion."
1 Kings,9,20," [And] all the people [that were] left of the Emori [Highlanders] , Hitti [Terrorists] , P’rizi [Dwellers in Unwalled Towns] , Hivi [Villagers] , and Y’vusi [Threshers, Trampled Under Foot] , which [were] not of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God],"
1 Kings,9,21,"Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] levy a tribute of bond service unto this day."
1 Kings,9,22,"But of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] make no bondmen: but they [were] men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen."
1 Kings,9,23,"These [were] the chief of the officers that [were] over Shlomo’s (Solomon) [peace] work, five hundred and fifty, which bore rule over the people that wrought in the work."
1 Kings,9,24,But Par’oh’s [Pharaoh - Great House] daughter came up out of the city of David [beloved] unto her house which [Shlomo (Solomon) [peace]] had built for her: then did he build Millo [fortification (defensive structure) or mound].
1 Kings,9,25,"And three times in a year did Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and he burnt incense upon the altar that [was] before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . So he finished the house."
1 Kings,9,26,"And king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] made a navy of ships in ‘Etzyon-Gever [backbone of a man] , which [is] beside Elot [grove of lofty trees] , on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom [Red]."
1 Kings,9,27,"And Hiram [noble] sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace]."
1 Kings,9,28,"And they came to Ofir [reducing to ashes] , and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought [it] to king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace]."
1 Kings,10,1,"And when the Queen of Sh’va [seven, an oath] heard of the fame of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] concerning the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , she came to prove him with hard questions."
1 Kings,10,2,"And she came to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , she communed with him of all that was in her heart."
1 Kings,10,3,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] told her all her questions: there was not [any] thing hid from the king, which he told her not."
1 Kings,10,4,"And when the Queen of Sh’va [seven, an oath] had seen all Shlomo’s (Solomon) [peace] wisdom, and the house that he had built,"
1 Kings,10,5,"And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; there was no more spirit in her."
1 Kings,10,6,"And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your i acts and of your i wisdom."
1 Kings,10,7,"However I believed not the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen [it] : and, behold, the half was not told me: you i wisdom and prosperity exceeds the fame which I heard."
1 Kings,10,8,"Happy [are] your i men, happy [are] these your i servants, which stand continually before you i, [and] that hear your i wisdom."
1 Kings,10,9,"Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) be the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which delighted in you i , to set you i on the throne of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) loved Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] forever, therefore made he you i king, to do judgment and justice."
1 Kings,10,10,"And she gave the king an hundred and twenty tons of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the Queen of Sh’va [seven, an oath] gave to king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace]."
1 Kings,10,11,"And the navy also of Hiram [noble] , that brought gold from Ofir [reducing to ashes] , brought in from Ofir [reducing to ashes] great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones."
1 Kings,10,12,"And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day."
1 Kings,10,13,"And king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] gave unto the Queen of Sh’va [seven, an oath] all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside [that] which Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants."
1 Kings,10,14,"Now the weight of gold that came to Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] in one year was six hundred threescore and six tons of gold,"
1 Kings,10,15,"Beside [that he had] of the merchantmen, and of the traffick (trade; do business) of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia [steppe-dwellers] , and of the governors of the country."
1 Kings,10,16,And king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] made two hundred targets [of] beaten gold: six hundred [shekels] of gold went to one target (small shield; buckler).
1 Kings,10,17,And [he made] three hundred shields [of] beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of L’vanon [Whiteness].
1 Kings,10,18,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold."
1 Kings,10,19,"The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne [was] round behind: and [there were] stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays."
1 Kings,10,20,And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
1 Kings,10,21,"And all king Shlomo’s (Solomon) [peace] drinking vessels [were of] gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of L’vanon [Whiteness] [were of] pure gold; none [were of] silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace]."
1 Kings,10,22,"For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish [yellow jasper] with the navy of Hiram [noble] : once in three years came the navy of Tarshish [yellow jasper] , bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks."
1 Kings,10,23,So king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
1 Kings,10,24,"And all the earth sought to Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , to hear his wisdom, which God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had put in his heart."
1 Kings,10,25,"And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year."
1 Kings,10,26,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
1 Kings,10,27,"And the king made silver [to be] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] as stones, and cedars made he [to be] as the sycamore trees that [are] in the vale, for abundance."
1 Kings,10,28,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] had horses brought out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price."
1 Kings,10,29,"And a chariot came up and went out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hitti [Terrorists] , and for the kings of Aram (Syria) [exalted] , did they bring [them] out by their means."
1 Kings,11,1,"But king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] , women of the Mo’avi [of his father], [what father?] ‘Amon [Inbred] , Edomi [red] , people of Tzidon [Hunting], [and] Hitti [Terrorists];"
1 Kings,11,2,"Of the nations [concerning] which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , You 2f shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: [for] surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] clave unto these in love."
1 Kings,11,3,"And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart."
1 Kings,11,4,"For it came to pass, when Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] was old, [that] his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , as [was] the heart of David [beloved] his father."
1 Kings,11,5,"For Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] went after ‘Ashtoret [star] the goddess of the people of Tzidon [Hunting] , and after Milkom [great king] the abomination of the ‘Amon [Inbred]."
1 Kings,11,6,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] did evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and went not fully after the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , as [did] David [beloved] his father."
1 Kings,11,7,"Then did Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] build an high place for K’mosh [Subduer] , the abomination of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , in the hill that [is] before Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and for Molekh [king] , the abomination of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred]."
1 Kings,11,8,"And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods."
1 Kings,11,9,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was angry with Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , because his heart was turned from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which had appeared unto him twice,"
1 Kings,11,10,"And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded."
1 Kings,11,11,"For what reason the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , Forasmuch as this is done of you i , and you i have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you i , I will surely rend (tear apart; forcefully rip apart) the kingdom from you i , and will give it to your i servant."
1 Kings,11,12,Yet in your i days I will not do it for David [beloved] your i father’s sake: [but] I will rend (tear apart; forcefully rip apart) it out of the hand of your i son.
1 Kings,11,13,"However I will not rend (tear apart; forcefully rip apart) away all the kingdom; [but] will give one tribe to you i son for David [beloved] my servant’s sake, and for Yerushalayim’s [Foundation of Peace] sake which I have chosen."
1 Kings,11,14,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) stirred up an adversary unto Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , Hadad [mighty] the Edomi [red] : he [was] of the king’s seed in Edom [Red]."
1 Kings,11,15,"For it came to pass, when David [beloved] was in Edom [Red] , and Yo’av [Yehovah is father] the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom [Red];"
1 Kings,11,16,"(For six months did Yo’av [Yehovah is father] remain there with all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , until he had cut off every male in Edom [Red])"
1 Kings,11,17,"That Hadad [mighty] fled, he and certain Edomi [red] of his father’s servants with him, to go into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ; Hadad [mighty] [being] yet a little child."
1 Kings,11,18,"And they arose out of Midyan [Strife] , and came to Pa’ran [place of caverns] : and they took men with them out of Pa’ran [place of caverns] , and they came to Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , unto Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals (food for humans) , and gave him land."
1 Kings,11,19,"And Hadad [mighty] found great favour in the sight of Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] , so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tachp’neis [wife of the king] the queen."
1 Kings,11,20,"And the sister of Tachp’neis [wife of the king] bore him G’nuvat [theft] his son, whom Tachp’neis [wife of the king] weaned in Par’oh’s [Pharaoh - Great House] house: and G’nuvat [theft] was in Par’oh’s [Pharaoh - Great House] household among the sons of Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House]."
1 Kings,11,21,"And when Hadad [mighty] heard in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] that David [beloved] slept with his fathers, and that Yo’av [Yehovah is father] the captain of the host was dead, Hadad [mighty] said to Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] , Let me depart, that I may go to my own country."
1 Kings,11,22,"Then Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] said unto him, But what have you i lacked with me, that, behold, you i seek to go to your i own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise."
1 Kings,11,23,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] stirred him up [another] adversary, Rezon [prince] the son of Elyada [God knows] , which fled from his lord Hadad’ezer [mighty - meaning disputed] king of Tzovah [station]:"
1 Kings,11,24,"And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David [beloved] killed them [of Tzovah [station]] : and they went to Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] , and dwelt in it, and reigned in Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver]."
1 Kings,11,25,"And he was an adversary to Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] all the days of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , beside the mischief that Hadad [mighty] [did] : and he abhorred Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and reigned over Aram (Syria) [exalted]."
1 Kings,11,26,"And Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , an Efrat [ashiness: fruitfulness] of Zereda, Shlomo’s (Solomon) [peace] servant, whose mother’s name [was] Tz’ru’ah [full breasted] , a widow woman, even he lifted up [his] hand against the king."
1 Kings,11,27,"And this [was] the cause that he lifted up [his] hand against the king: Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] built Millo [fortification (defensive structure) or mound], [and] repaired the breaches of the city of David [beloved] his father."
1 Kings,11,28,"And the man Yarov’am [the people will contend] [was] a mighty man of valour: and Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Yosef [(God) He Shall Add]."
1 Kings,11,29,"And it came to pass at that time when Yarov’am [the people will contend] went out of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , that the prophet Achiyah [brother of Yehovah] the Shiloni [peace bringer] [place of rest] found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two [were] alone in the field:"
1 Kings,11,30,"And Achiyah [brother of Yehovah] caught the new garment that [was] on him, and rent it [in] twelve pieces:"
1 Kings,11,31,"And he said to Yarov’am [the people will contend] , Take you i ten pieces: for thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Behold, I will rend (tear apart; forcefully rip apart) the kingdom out of the hand of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , and will give ten tribes to you i:"
1 Kings,11,32,"(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David’s [beloved] ’s sake, and for Yerushalayim’s [Foundation of Peace] sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God])"
1 Kings,11,33,"Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped ‘Ashtoret [star] the goddess of the people of Tzidon [Hunting] , K’mosh [Subduer] the god of the Mo’avi [of his father] , and Milkom [great king] the god of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , and have not walked in my ways, to do [that which is] right in my eyes, and [to keep] my statutes and my judgments, as [did] David [beloved] his father."
1 Kings,11,34,"However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David [beloved] my servant’s sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:"
1 Kings,11,35,"But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it unto you i, [even] ten tribes."
1 Kings,11,36,"And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David [beloved] my servant may have a light always before me in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , the city which I have chosen me to put my name there."
1 Kings,11,37,"And I will take you i , and you i shall reign according to all that your i soul desires, and shall be king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Kings,11,38,"And it shall be, if you i will hearken unto all that I command you i , and will walk in my ways, and do [that is] right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David [beloved] my servant did; that I will be with you i , and build you i a sure house, as I built for David [beloved] , and will give Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] unto you i."
1 Kings,11,39,"And I will for this afflict the seed of David [beloved] , but not forever."
1 Kings,11,40,"Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] sought therefore to kill Yarov’am [the people will contend] . And Yarov’am [the people will contend] arose, and fled into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , unto Shishak [greedy of fine linen] king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and was in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] until the death of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace]."
1 Kings,11,41,"And the rest of the acts of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , and all that he did, and his wisdom, [are] they not written in the book of the acts of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace]?"
1 Kings,11,42,And the time that Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] reigned in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] over all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [was] forty years.
1 Kings,11,43,"And Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David [beloved] his father: and Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] his son reigned in his stead."
1 Kings,12,1,And Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] went to Sh’khem [Shoulder] : for all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were come to Sh’khem [Shoulder] to make him king.
1 Kings,12,2,"And it came to pass, when Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , who was yet in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , heard [of it] , (for he was fled from the presence of king Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , and Yarov’am [the people will contend] dwelt in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ;)"
1 Kings,12,3,"That they sent and called him. And Yarov’am [the people will contend] and all the congregation of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came, and spoke unto Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] , saying,"
1 Kings,12,4,"Your 1s father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you i the grievous service of your i father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve you i."
1 Kings,12,5,"And he said unto them, Depart yet [for] three days, then come again to me. And the people departed."
1 Kings,12,6,"And king Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] consulted with the old men, that stood before Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] his father while he yet lived, and said, How do you 2f advise that I may answer this people?"
1 Kings,12,7,"And they spoke unto him, saying, If you i will be a servant unto this people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your i servants forever."
1 Kings,12,8,"But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, [and] which stood before him:"
1 Kings,12,9,"And he said unto them, What counsel give you 2f that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which your i father did put upon us lighter?"
1 Kings,12,10,"And the young men that were grown up with him spoke unto him, saying, Thus shall you i speak unto this people that spoke unto you i , saying, Your 1s father made our yoke heavy, but make you i [it] lighter unto us; thus shall you i say unto them, My little [finger] shall be thicker than my father’s waist (hips)."
1 Kings,12,11,"And now whereas my father did burden (to load) you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father has chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."
1 Kings,12,12,"So Yarov’am [the people will contend] and all the people came to Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day."
1 Kings,12,13,"And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men’s counsel that they gave him;"
1 Kings,12,14,"And spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father [also] chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."
1 Kings,12,15,"For what reason the king listened not unto the people; for the cause was from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that he might perform his saying, which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke by Achiyah [brother of Yehovah] the Shiloni [peace bringer] [place of rest] unto Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect]."
1 Kings,12,16,"So when all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] saw that the king listened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David [beloved] ? neither [have we] inheritance in the son of Yishai [I possess] : to your tents, O Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : now see to your i own house, David [beloved] . So Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] departed unto their tents."
1 Kings,12,17,"But [as for] the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] which dwelt in the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] reigned over them."
1 Kings,12,18,"Then king Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] sent Adoram [my lord is exalted] , who [was] over the tribute; and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
1 Kings,12,19,So Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] rebelled against the house of David [beloved] unto this day.
1 Kings,12,20,"And it came to pass, when all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] heard that Yarov’am [the people will contend] was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : there was none that followed the house of David [beloved] , but the tribe of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] only."
1 Kings,12,21,"And when Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] was come to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , he assembled all the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , with the tribe of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , an hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , to bring the kingdom again to Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] the son of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace]."
1 Kings,12,22,"But the word of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] came unto Sh’may’yah [Yehovah hears] the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , saying,"
1 Kings,12,23,"Speak unto Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] , the son of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] , king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and unto all the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , and to the remnant of the people, saying,"
1 Kings,12,24,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , You 2f shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They listened therefore to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and returned to depart, according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Kings,12,25,"Then Yarov’am [the people will contend] built Sh’khem [Shoulder] in mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , and dwelt in it; and went out from there, and built P’nu’el [Facing God]."
1 Kings,12,26,"And Yarov’am [the people will contend] said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David [beloved]:"
1 Kings,12,27,"If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, [even] unto Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and they shall kill me, and go again to Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
1 Kings,12,28,"Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves [of] gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : behold your i gods, O Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which brought you i up out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
1 Kings,12,29,"And he set the one in Beit-El [House of God] , and the other put he in Dan [Judge]."
1 Kings,12,30,"And this thing became a sin: for the people went [to worship] before the one, [even] unto Dan [Judge]."
1 Kings,12,31,"And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner]."
1 Kings,12,32,"And Yarov’am [the people will contend] ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that [is] in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beit-El [House of God] , sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beit-El [House of God] the priests of the high places which he had made."
1 Kings,12,33,"So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beit-El [House of God] the fifteenth day of the eighth month, [even] in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense."
1 Kings,13,1,"And, behold, there came a man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] out of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] by the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto Beit-El [House of God] : and Yarov’am [the people will contend] stood by the altar to burn incense."
1 Kings,13,2,"And he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, O altar, altar, thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David [beloved] , Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] by name; and upon you i shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon you i , and men’s bones shall be burnt upon you i."
1 Kings,13,3,"And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This [is] the sign which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that [are] upon it shall be poured out."
1 Kings,13,4,"And it came to pass, when king Yarov’am [the people will contend] heard the saying of the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which had cried against the altar in Beit-El [House of God] , that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him."
1 Kings,13,5,"The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had given by the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Kings,13,6,"And the king answered and said unto the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , Entreat now the face of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] besought the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the king’s hand was restored him again, and became as [it was] before."
1 Kings,13,7,"And the king said unto the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you i a reward."
1 Kings,13,8,"And the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] said unto the king, If you i will give me half your i house, I will not go in with you i , neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:"
1 Kings,13,9,"For so was it charged me by the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that you i came."
1 Kings,13,10,"So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beit-El [House of God]."
1 Kings,13,11,"Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beit-El [House of God] ; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had done that day in Beit-El [House of God] : the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father."
1 Kings,13,12,"And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] went, which came from Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
1 Kings,13,13,"And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,"
1 Kings,13,14,"And went after the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, [Are] you i the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] that came from Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ? And he said, I [am]."
1 Kings,13,15,"Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread."
1 Kings,13,16,"And he said, I may not return with you i , nor go in with you i : neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you i in this place:"
1 Kings,13,17,"For it was said to me by the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , you i shall eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that you i came."
1 Kings,13,18,"He said unto him, I [am] a prophet also as you i [are] ; and an angel spoke unto me by the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, Bring him back with you i into your i house, that he may eat bread and drink water. [But] he lied unto him."
1 Kings,13,19,"So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water."
1 Kings,13,20,"And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto the prophet that brought him back:"
1 Kings,13,21,"And he cried unto the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] that came from Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , saying, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Forasmuch as you i have disobeyed the mouth of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and have not kept the commandment which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] commanded you i,"
1 Kings,13,22,"But came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which [the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)] did say to you i , Eat no bread, and drink no water; your i carcass shall not come unto the sepulcher of your i fathers."
1 Kings,13,23,"And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, [that is to say] , for the prophet whom he had brought back."
1 Kings,13,24,"And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and killed him: and his carcass was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcass."
1 Kings,13,25,"And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcass: and they came and told [it] in the city where the old prophet dwelt."
1 Kings,13,26,"And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard [thereof] , he said, It [is] the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , who was disobedient unto the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : therefore the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has delivered him unto the lion, which has torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he spoke unto him."
1 Kings,13,27,"And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled [him]."
1 Kings,13,28,"And he went and found his carcass cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten the carcass, nor torn the ass."
1 Kings,13,29,"And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him."
1 Kings,13,30,"And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they mourned over him, [saying] , Alas, my brother!"
1 Kings,13,31,"And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulcher wherein the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is] buried; lay my bones beside his bones:"
1 Kings,13,32,"For the saying which he cried by the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) against the altar in Beit-El [House of God] , and against all the houses of the high places which [are] in the cities of Shomron [watch mountain] , shall surely come to pass."
1 Kings,13,33,"After this thing Yarov’am [the people will contend] returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became [one] of the priests of the high places."
1 Kings,13,34,"And this thing became sin unto the house of Yarov’am [the people will contend] , even to cut [it] off, and to destroy [it] from off the face of the earth."
1 Kings,14,1,At that time Aviyah [Yehovah is (my) father] the son of Yarov’am [the people will contend] fell sick.
1 Kings,14,2,"And Yarov’am [the people will contend] said to his wife, Arise, I pray you i , and disguise yourself, that you i be not known to be the wife of Yarov’am [the people will contend] ; and get you i to Shiloh [Place of Rest] : behold, there [is] Achiyah [brother of Yehovah] the prophet, which told me that [I should be] king over this people."
1 Kings,14,3,"And take with you i ten loaves, and cracknels (dry, brittle cakes or buscuits) , and a pot of honey, and go to him: he shall tell you i what shall become of the child."
1 Kings,14,4,"And Yarov’am’s [the people will contend] wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh [Place of Rest] , and came to the house of Achiyah [brother of Yehovah] . But Achiyah [brother of Yehovah] could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age."
1 Kings,14,5,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Achiyah [brother of Yehovah] , Behold, the wife of Yarov’am [the people will contend] comes to ask a thing of you i for her son; for he [is] sick: thus and thus shall you i say unto her: for it shall be, when she comes in, that she shall feign (to pretend to be; to disguise) herself [to be] another [woman]."
1 Kings,14,6,"And it was [so] , when Achiyah [brother of Yehovah] heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, you i wife of Yarov’am [the people will contend] ; why pretend you i yourself [to be] another? for I [am] sent to you i [with] heavy [tidings]."
1 Kings,14,7,"Go, tell Yarov’am [the people will contend] , Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Forasmuch as I exalted you i from among the people, and made you i prince over my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God],"
1 Kings,14,8,"And rent the kingdom away from the house of David [beloved] , and gave it you i : and [yet] you i have not been as my servant David [beloved] , who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do [that] only [which was] right in my eyes;"
1 Kings,14,9,"But have done evil above all that were before you i : for you i have gone and made you i other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your i back:"
1 Kings,14,10,"Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Yarov’am [the people will contend] , and will cut off from Yarov’am [the people will contend] him that pisses against the wall, [and] him that is shut up and left in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and will take away the remnant of the house of Yarov’am [the people will contend] , as a man takes away dung, till it be all gone."
1 Kings,14,11,Him that dies of Yarov’am [the people will contend] in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dies in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has spoken [it].
1 Kings,14,12,"Arise you i therefore, get you i to your i own house: [and] when your i feet enter into the city, the child shall die."
1 Kings,14,13,"And all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Yarov’am [the people will contend] shall come to the grave, because in him there is found [some] good thing toward the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in the house of Yarov’am [the people will contend]."
1 Kings,14,14,"Moreover the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall raise him up a king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , who shall cut off the house of Yarov’am [the people will contend] that day: but what (will God do) even now?"
1 Kings,14,15,"For the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall strike Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to anger."
1 Kings,14,16,"And he shall give Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] up because of the sins of Yarov’am [the people will contend] , who did sin, and who made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin."
1 Kings,14,17,"And Yarov’am’s [the people will contend] wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirtzah [Favourable]: [and] when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;"
1 Kings,14,18,"And they buried him; and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] mourned for him, according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he spoke by the hand of his servant Achiyah [brother of Yehovah] the prophet."
1 Kings,14,19,"And the rest of the acts of Yarov’am [the people will contend] , how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they [are] written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Kings,14,20,"And the days which Yarov’am [the people will contend] reigned [were] two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadav [Generous] his son reigned in his stead."
1 Kings,14,21,"And Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] the son of Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] reigned in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] . Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] [was] forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , the city which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) did choose out of all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , to put his name there. And his mother’s name [was] Na’amah [Loveliness] an ‘Amonit [tribal]."
1 Kings,14,22,"And Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] did evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done."
1 Kings,14,23,"For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree."
1 Kings,14,24,And there were also sodomites in the land: [and] they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) cast out before the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
1 Kings,14,25,"And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rechav’am [a people has enlarged], [that] Shishak [greedy of fine linen] king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] came up against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]:"
1 Kings,14,26,"And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] had made."
1 Kings,14,27,"And king Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] made in their stead brazen shields, and committed [them] unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king’s house."
1 Kings,14,28,"And it was [so] , when the king went into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard chamber."
1 Kings,14,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] , and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]?"
1 Kings,14,30,And there was war between Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] and Yarov’am [the people will contend] all [their] days.
1 Kings,14,31,"And Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David [beloved] . And his mother’s name [was] Na’amah [Loveliness] an ‘Amonit [tribal] . And Aviyam [Yah is my father] his son reigned in his stead."
1 Kings,15,1,Now in the eighteenth year of king Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] reigned Aviyam [Yah is my father] over Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised].
1 Kings,15,2,"Three years reigned he in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And his mother’s name [was] Ma’akhah [oppression] , the daughter of Avishalom [my father is peace]."
1 Kings,15,3,"And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , as the heart of David [beloved] his father."
1 Kings,15,4,"Nevertheless for David’s [beloved] ’s sake did the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] give him a lamp in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , to set up his son after him, and to establish Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]:"
1 Kings,15,5,"Because David [beloved] did [that which was] right in the eyes of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and turned not aside from any [thing] that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriyah [Yehovah is my light (flame)] the Hitti [Terrorists]."
1 Kings,15,6,And there was war between Rechav’am [a people has enlarged] and Yarov’am [the people will contend] all the days of his life.
1 Kings,15,7,"Now the rest of the acts of Aviyam [Yah is my father] , and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ? And there was war between Aviyam [Yah is my father] and Yarov’am [the people will contend]."
1 Kings,15,8,And Aviyam [Yah is my father] slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David [beloved] : and Asa [healer; injurious?] his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings,15,9,And in the twentieth year of Yarov’am [the people will contend] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] reigned Asa [healer; injurious?] over Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised].
1 Kings,15,10,"And forty and one years reigned he in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And his mother’s name [was] Ma’akhah [oppression] , the daughter of Avishalom [my father is peace]."
1 Kings,15,11,"And Asa [healer; injurious?] did [that which was] right in the eyes of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , as [did] David [beloved] his father."
1 Kings,15,12,"And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made."
1 Kings,15,13,"And also Ma’akhah [oppression] his mother, even her he removed from [being] queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa [healer; injurious?] destroyed her idol, and burnt [it] by the brook Kidron [dark]."
1 Kings,15,14,But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa’s [healer; injurious?] heart was perfect with the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) all his days.
1 Kings,15,15,"And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , silver, and gold, and vessels."
1 Kings,15,16,And there was war between Asa [healer; injurious?] and Ba’sha [wicked] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] all their days.
1 Kings,15,17,"And Ba’sha [wicked] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went up against Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and built Ramah [Hill] , that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa [healer; injurious?] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
1 Kings,15,18,"Then Asa [healer; injurious?] took all the silver and the gold [that were] left in the treasures of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa [healer; injurious?] sent them to Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] , the son of Tavirmmon [good is pomegranate] , the son of Hezyon [vision] , king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] , that dwelt at Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] , saying,"
1 Kings,15,19," [There is] a league between me and you i, [and] between my father and your i father: behold, I have sent unto you i a present of silver and gold; come and break your i league with Ba’sha [wicked] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that he may depart from me."
1 Kings,15,20,"So Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] listened unto king Asa [healer; injurious?] , and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and struck ‘Iyon [a ruin] , and Dan [Judge] , and Avel-Beit-Ma’akhah [meadow of the house of oppression] , and all Kinn’rot [harps] , with all the land of Naftali [My Wrestling]."
1 Kings,15,21,"And it came to pass, when Ba’sha [wicked] heard [thereof] , that he left off building of Ramah [Hill] , and dwelt in Tirtzah [Favourable]."
1 Kings,15,22,"Then king Asa [healer; injurious?] made a proclamation throughout all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ; none [was] exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah [Hill] , and the timber thereof, which Ba’sha [wicked] had built; and king Asa [healer; injurious?] built with them Geva [hill] of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , and Mitzpah [watchtower]."
1 Kings,15,23,"The rest of all the acts of Asa [healer; injurious?] , and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet."
1 Kings,15,24,"And Asa [healer; injurious?] slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David [beloved] his father: and Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] his son reigned in his stead."
1 Kings,15,25,"And Nadav [Generous] the son of Yarov’am [the people will contend] began to reign over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in the second year of Asa [healer; injurious?] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and reigned over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] two years."
1 Kings,15,26,"And he did evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin which he made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin."
1 Kings,15,27,"And Ba’sha [wicked] the son of Achiyah [brother of Yehovah] , of the house of Yissakhar [There Is Recompense] , conspired against him; and Ba’sha [wicked] struck him at Gib’ton [mound] , which [belonged] to the P’lishtim [Immigrants] ; for Nadav [Generous] and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] laid siege to Gib’ton [mound]."
1 Kings,15,28,"Even in the third year of Asa [healer; injurious?] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] did Ba’sha [wicked] slay him, and reigned in his stead."
1 Kings,15,29,"And it came to pass, when he reigned, [that] he struck all the house of Yarov’am [the people will contend] ; he left not to Yarov’am [the people will contend] any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he spoke by his servant Achiyah [brother of Yehovah] the Shiloni [peace bringer] [place of rest]:"
1 Kings,15,30,"Because of the sins of Yarov’am [the people will contend] which he sinned, and which he made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] sin, by his provocation which he provoked the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to anger."
1 Kings,15,31,"Now the rest of the acts of Nadav [Generous] , and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
1 Kings,15,32,And there was war between Asa [healer; injurious?] and Ba’sha [wicked] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] all their days.
1 Kings,15,33,"In the third year of Asa [healer; injurious?] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] began Ba’sha [wicked] the son of Achiyah [brother of Yehovah] to reign over all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in Tirtzah [Favourable] , twenty and four years."
1 Kings,15,34,"And he did evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and walked in the way of Yarov’am [the people will contend] , and in his sin which he made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin."
1 Kings,16,1,"Then the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came to Yehu [Yehovah is He] the son of Hanani [gracious] against Ba’sha [wicked] , saying,"
1 Kings,16,2,"Forasmuch as I exalted you i out of the dust, and made you i prince over my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and you i have walked in the way of Yarov’am [the people will contend] , and have made my people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;"
1 Kings,16,3,"Behold, I will take away the posterity of Ba’sha [wicked] , and the posterity of his house; and will make you i house like the house of Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect]."
1 Kings,16,4,Him that dies of Ba’sha [wicked] in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dies of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.
1 Kings,16,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Ba’sha [wicked] , and what he did, and his might, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
1 Kings,16,6,"So Ba’sha [wicked] slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirtzah [Favourable] : and Elah [an oak] his son reigned in his stead."
1 Kings,16,7,"And also by the hand of the prophet Yehu [Yehovah is He] the son of Hanani [gracious] came the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) against Ba’sha [wicked] , and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Yarov’am [the people will contend] ; and because he killed him."
1 Kings,16,8,"In the twenty and sixth year of Asa [healer; injurious?] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] began Elah [an oak] the son of Ba’sha [wicked] to reign over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in Tirtzah [Favourable] , two years."
1 Kings,16,9,"And his servant Zimri [My Music] , captain of half [his] chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirtzah [Favourable] , drinking himself drunk in the house of Artza [earthy] steward of [his] house in Tirtzah [Favourable]."
1 Kings,16,10,"And Zimri [My Music] went in and struck him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa [healer; injurious?] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and reigned in his stead."
1 Kings,16,11,"And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, [that] he killed all the house of Ba’sha [wicked] : he left him not one that pisses against a wall, neither of his relatives, nor of his friends."
1 Kings,16,12,"Thus did Zimri [My Music] destroy all the house of Ba’sha [wicked] , according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he spoke against Ba’sha [wicked] by Yehu [Yehovah is He] the prophet,"
1 Kings,16,13,"For all the sins of Ba’sha [wicked] , and the sins of Elah [an oak] his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin, in provoking the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to anger with their vanities."
1 Kings,16,14,"Now the rest of the acts of Elah [an oak] , and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
1 Kings,16,15,"In the twenty and seventh year of Asa [healer; injurious?] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] did Zimri [My Music] reign seven days in Tirtzah [Favourable] . And the people [were] encamped against Gib’ton [mound] , which [belonged] to the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."
1 Kings,16,16,"And the people [that were] encamped heard say, Zimri [My Music] has conspired, and has also slain the king: wherefore all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] made ‘Omri [pupil of Yehovah] , the captain of the host, king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that day in the camp."
1 Kings,16,17,"And ‘Omri [pupil of Yehovah] went up from Gib’ton [mound] , and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with him, and they besieged Tirtzah [Favourable]."
1 Kings,16,18,"And it came to pass, when Zimri [My Music] saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died,"
1 Kings,16,19,"For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , in walking in the way of Yarov’am [the people will contend] , and in his sin which he did, to make Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin."
1 Kings,16,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Zimri [My Music] , and his treason that he wrought, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
1 Kings,16,21,"Then were the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tivni [intelligent] the son of Ginat [protection] , to make him king; and half followed ‘Omri [pupil of Yehovah]."
1 Kings,16,22,"But the people that followed ‘Omri [pupil of Yehovah] prevailed against the people that followed Tivni [intelligent] the son of Ginat [protection] : so Tivni [intelligent] died, and ‘Omri [pupil of Yehovah] reigned."
1 Kings,16,23,"In the thirty and first year of Asa [healer; injurious?] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] began ‘Omri [pupil of Yehovah] to reign over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirtzah [Favourable]."
1 Kings,16,24,"And he bought the hill Shomron [watch mountain] of Shemer [preserved] for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer [preserved] , owner of the hill, Shomron [watch mountain]."
1 Kings,16,25,"But ‘Omri [pupil of Yehovah] wrought evil in the eyes of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and did worse than all that [were] before him."
1 Kings,16,26,"For he walked in all the way of Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , and in his sin which he made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin, to provoke the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to anger with their vanities."
1 Kings,16,27,"Now the rest of the acts of ‘Omri [pupil of Yehovah] which he did, and his might that he showed, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
1 Kings,16,28,"So ‘Omri [pupil of Yehovah] slept with his fathers, and was buried in Shomron [watch mountain] : and Ach’av [father’s brother] his son reigned in his stead."
1 Kings,16,29,And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa [healer; injurious?] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] began Ach’av [father’s brother] the son of ‘Omri [pupil of Yehovah] to reign over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and Ach’av [father’s brother] the son of ‘Omri [pupil of Yehovah] reigned over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in Shomron [watch mountain] twenty and two years.
1 Kings,16,30,And Ach’av [father’s brother] the son of ‘Omri [pupil of Yehovah] did evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) above all that [were] before him.
1 Kings,16,31,"And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , that he took to wife Izevel [Ba’al exalts] the daughter of Etba’al [with Ba’al] king of the people of Tzidon [Hunting] , and went and served Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , and worshipped him."
1 Kings,16,32,"And he reared up an altar for Ba’al [lord (a false god)] in the house of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , which he had built in Shomron [watch mountain]."
1 Kings,16,33,And Ach’av [father’s brother] made a grove; and Ach’av [father’s brother] did more to provoke the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to anger than all the kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that were before him.
1 Kings,16,34,"In his days did Hi’el [God lives] the Beit-Eli [House of God] build Yericho [Its Moon] : he laid the foundation thereof in Aviram [My Father is Exalted] his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest [son] S’guv [exalted] , according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he spoke by Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Nun [Posterity]."
1 Kings,17,1,"And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] the Tishbi [captivity], [who was] of the inhabitants of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , said unto Ach’av [father’s brother], [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word."
1 Kings,17,2,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto him, saying,"
1 Kings,17,3,"Get you i hence, and turn you i eastward, and hide yourself by the brook K’rit [cutting] , that [is] before Yarden [Descender]."
1 Kings,17,4,"And it shall be, [that] you i shall drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed you i there."
1 Kings,17,5,"So he went and did according unto the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : for he went and dwelt by the brook K’rit [cutting] , that [is] before Yarden [Descender]."
1 Kings,17,6,"And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook."
1 Kings,17,7,"And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land."
1 Kings,17,8,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came unto him, saying,"
1 Kings,17,9,"Arise, get you i to Tzarfat [refinery] , which [belongs] to Tzidon [Hunting] , and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain you i."
1 Kings,17,10,"So he arose and went to Tzarfat [refinery] . And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman [was] there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray you i , a little water in a vessel, that I may drink."
1 Kings,17,11,"And as she was going to fetch [it] , he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray you i , a morsel of bread in your i hand."
1 Kings,17,12,"And she said, [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] lives, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a pot: and, behold, I [am] gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die."
1 Kings,17,13,"And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] said unto her, Fear not; go [and] do as you i have said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring [it] unto me, and after make for you i and for your i son."
1 Kings,17,14,"For thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the pot of oil fail, until the day [that] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) send rain upon the earth."
1 Kings,17,15,"And she went and did according to the saying of Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] : and she, and he, and her house, did eat [many] days."
1 Kings,17,16," [And] the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the pot of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he spoke by Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah]."
1 Kings,17,17,"And it came to pass after these things, [that] the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him."
1 Kings,17,18,"And she said unto Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] , What have I to do with you i , O you i man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ? are you i come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?"
1 Kings,17,19,"And he said unto her, Give me your i son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed."
1 Kings,17,20,"And he cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , have you i also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?"
1 Kings,17,21,"And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , I pray you i , let this child’s soul come into him again."
1 Kings,17,22,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) heard the voice of Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] ; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived."
1 Kings,17,23,"And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] said, See, your i son lives."
1 Kings,17,24,"And the woman said to Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] , Now by this I know that you i [are] a man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered], [and] that the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in your i mouth [is] truth."
1 Kings,18,1,"And it came to pass [after] many days, that the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came to Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself unto Ach’av [father’s brother] ; and I will send rain upon the earth."
1 Kings,18,2,And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] went to show himself unto Ach’av [father’s brother] . And [there was] a sore famine in Shomron [watch mountain].
1 Kings,18,3,"And Ach’av [father’s brother] called ‘Ovadyah [servant of Yehovah] , which [was] the governor of [his] house. (Now ‘Ovadyah [servant of Yehovah] feared the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) greatly:"
1 Kings,18,4,"For it was [so] , when Izevel [Ba’al exalts] cut off the prophets of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that ‘Ovadyah [servant of Yehovah] took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)"
1 Kings,18,5,"And Ach’av [father’s brother] said unto ‘Ovadyah [servant of Yehovah] , Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: perhaps we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts."
1 Kings,18,6,"So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ach’av [father’s brother] went one way by himself, and ‘Ovadyah [servant of Yehovah] went another way by himself."
1 Kings,18,7,"And as ‘Ovadyah [servant of Yehovah] was in the way, behold, Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, [Is it really] you i my lord Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah]?"
1 Kings,18,8,"And he answered him, I [am] : go, tell your i lord, Behold, Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] [is here]."
1 Kings,18,9,"And he said, What have I sinned, that you i would deliver your i servant into the hand of Ach’av [father’s brother] , to slay me?"
1 Kings,18,10," [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] lives, there is no nation or kingdom, to which my lord has not sent to seek you i : and when they said, [He is] not [there] ; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found you i not."
1 Kings,18,11,"And now you i say, Go, tell your i lord, Behold, Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] [is here]."
1 Kings,18,12,"And it shall come to pass, [as soon as] I am gone from you i , that the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall carry you i to where I know not; and [so] when I come and tell Ach’av [father’s brother] , and he cannot find you i , he shall slay me: but I your i servant fear the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) from my youth."
1 Kings,18,13,"Was it not told my lord what I did when Izevel [Ba’al exalts] killed the prophets of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , how I hid an hundred men of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?"
1 Kings,18,14,"And now you i say, Go, tell your i lord, Behold, Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] [is here] : and he shall slay me."
1 Kings,18,15,"And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] said, [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself unto him to day."
1 Kings,18,16,"So ‘Ovadyah [servant of Yehovah] went to meet Ach’av [father’s brother] , and told him: and Ach’av [father’s brother] went to meet Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah]."
1 Kings,18,17,"And it came to pass, when Ach’av [father’s brother] saw Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] , that Ach’av [father’s brother] said unto him, [Are] you i he that troubles Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
1 Kings,18,18,"And he answered, I have not troubled Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; but you i , and your i father’s house, in that you 2f have forsaken the commandments of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and you i have followed Ba’alim [lords (false gods)]."
1 Kings,18,19,"Now therefore send, [and] gather to me all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] unto mount Carmel [Garden-land] , and the prophets of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Izevel’s [Ba’al exalts] table."
1 Kings,18,20,"So Ach’av [father’s brother] sent unto all the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel [Garden-land]."
1 Kings,18,21,"And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] came unto all the people, and said, How long lame (crippled in the feet) you 2f between two opinions? if the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [be] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , follow him: but if Ba’al [lord (a false god)], [then] follow him. And the people answered him not a word."
1 Kings,18,22,"Then said Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] unto the people, I, [even] I only, remain a prophet of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; but Ba’al’s [lord (a false god)] prophets [are] four hundred and fifty men."
1 Kings,18,23,"Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay [it] on wood, and put no fire [under] : and I will dress the other bullock, and lay [it] on wood, and put no fire [under]:"
1 Kings,18,24,"And call you 2f on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] that answers by fire, let him be God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] . And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken."
1 Kings,18,25,"And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] said unto the prophets of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress [it] first; for you 2f [are] many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire [under]."
1 Kings,18,26,"And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed [it] , and called on the name of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] from morning even until noon, saying, O Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , hear us. But [there was] no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made."
1 Kings,18,27,"And it came to pass at noon, that Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he [is] a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, [or] perhaps he sleeps, and must be awakened."
1 Kings,18,28,"And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them."
1 Kings,18,29,"And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the [time] of the offering of the [evening] sacrifice, that [there was] neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded."
1 Kings,18,30,"And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [that was] broken down."
1 Kings,18,31,"And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Ya’akov [Heal of God] , unto whom the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came, saying, Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall be your i name:"
1 Kings,18,32,"And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed."
1 Kings,18,33,"And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid [him] on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour [it] on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood."
1 Kings,18,34,"And he said, Do [it] the second time. And they did [it] the second time. And he said, Do [it] the third time. And they did [it] the third time."
1 Kings,18,35,And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
1 Kings,18,36,"And it came to pass at [the time of] the offering of the [evening] sacrifice, that Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] the prophet came near, and said, Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Avraham [Exalted Father] , Yitz’khak [Laughter] , and of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , let it be known this day that you i [are] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and [that] I [am] your i servant, and [that] I have done all these things at your i word."
1 Kings,18,37,"Hear me, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , hear me, that this people may know that you i [are] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and [that] you i have turned their heart back again."
1 Kings,18,38,"Then the fire of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that [was] in the trench."
1 Kings,18,39,"And when all the people saw [it] , they fell on their faces: and they said, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , he [is] the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , he [is] the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
1 Kings,18,40,"And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] said unto them, Take the prophets of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] ; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] brought them down to the brook Kishon [Winding] , and killed them there."
1 Kings,18,41,"And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] said unto Ach’av [father’s brother] , Get you i up, eat and drink; for [there is] a sound of abundance of rain."
1 Kings,18,42,"So Ach’av [father’s brother] went up to eat and to drink. And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] went up to the top of Carmel [Garden-land] ; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,"
1 Kings,18,43,"And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, [There is] nothing. And he said, Go again seven times."
1 Kings,18,44,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there arises a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ach’av [father’s brother] , Prepare [you i chariot] , and get you i down, that the rain stop you i not."
1 Kings,18,45,"And it came to pass in the meanwhile, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ach’av [father’s brother] rode, and went to Yizre’el [God Sows]."
1 Kings,18,46,"And the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was on Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] ; and he girded up his waist, and ran before Ach’av [father’s brother] to the entrance of Yizre’el [God Sows]."
1 Kings,19,1,"And Ach’av [father’s brother] told Izevel [Ba’al exalts] all that Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword."
1 Kings,19,2,"Then Izevel [Ba’al exalts] sent a messenger unto Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] , saying, So let the gods do [to me] , and more also, if I make not your i life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time."
1 Kings,19,3,"And when he saw [that] , he arose, and went for his life, and came to Be’er-sheva [Well of the sevenfold Oath] , which [belongs] to Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and left his servant there."
1 Kings,19,4,"But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , take away my life; for I [am] not better than my fathers."
1 Kings,19,5,"And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel [Mal’ach] touched him, and said unto him, Arise [and] eat."
1 Kings,19,6,"And he looked, and, behold, [there was] a cake baked on the coals, and a pot of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again."
1 Kings,19,7,"And the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise [and] eat; because the journey [is] too great for you i."
1 Kings,19,8,"And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horev [Desert] the mount of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
1 Kings,19,9,"And he came there unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [came] to him, and he said unto him, What do you i here, Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah]?"
1 Kings,19,10,"And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] : for the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] have forsaken you i covenant, thrown down you i altars, and slain you i prophets with the sword; and I, [even] I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away."
1 Kings,19,11,"And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . And, behold, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate); [but] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [was] not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; [but] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [was] not in the earthquake:"
1 Kings,19,12,And after the earthquake a fire; [but] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [was] not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
1 Kings,19,13,"And it was [so] , when Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] heard [it] , that he wrapped his face in his Mantle (cloak; covering garment) (cloak) , and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, [there came] a voice unto him, and said, What do you i here, Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah]?"
1 Kings,19,14,"And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] : because the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] have forsaken your i covenant, thrown down your i altars, and slain your i prophets with the sword; and I, [even] I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away."
1 Kings,19,15,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto him, Go, return on you i way to the wilderness of Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] : and when you i come, anoint Haza’el [one who sees God] [to be] king over Aram (Syria) [exalted]:"
1 Kings,19,16,And Yehu [Yehovah is He] the son of Nimshi [rescued] shall you i anoint [to be] king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and Eli-sha [my God is salvation] the son of Shafat [He Has Judged] of Avel-M’cholah [Meadow of Dancing] shall you i anoint [to be] prophet in your i room.
1 Kings,19,17,"And it shall come to pass, [that] him that escapes the sword of Haza’el [one who sees God] shall Yehu [Yehovah is He] slay: and him that escapes from the sword of Yehu [Yehovah is He] shall Eli-sha [my God is salvation] slay."
1 Kings,19,18,"Yet I have left [me] seven thousand in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , all the knees which have not bowed unto Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , and every mouth which has not kissed him."
1 Kings,19,19,"So he departed there, and found Eli-sha [my God is salvation] the son of Shafat [He Has Judged] , who [was] plowing [with] twelve yoke [of oxen] before him, and he with the twelfth: and Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] passed by him, and cast his Mantle (cloak; covering garment) (cloak) upon him."
1 Kings,19,20,"And he left the oxen, and ran after Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] , and said, Let me, I pray you i , kiss my father and my mother, and [then] I will follow you i . And he said unto him, Go (and return) back again: for what I have done to you i."
1 Kings,19,21,"And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] , and ministered unto him."
1 Kings,20,1,"And Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] the king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] gathered all his host together: and [there were] thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and he went up and besieged Shomron [watch mountain] , and warred against it."
1 Kings,20,2,"And he sent messengers to Ach’av [father’s brother] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] into the city, and said unto him, Thus says Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad],"
1 Kings,20,3,"Your 1s silver and your i gold [is] my; your i wives also and your i children, [even] the best, [are] my."
1 Kings,20,4,"And the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] answered and said, My lord, O king, according to your i saying, I [am] yoursi, and all that I have."
1 Kings,20,5,"And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] , saying, Although I have sent unto you i , saying, you i shall deliver me your i silver, and your i gold, and your i wives, and your i children;"
1 Kings,20,6,"Yet I will send my servants unto you i tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your i house, and the houses of your i servants; and it shall be, [that] whatsoever is pleasant in your i eyes, they shall put [it] in their hand, and take [it] away."
1 Kings,20,7,"Then the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this [man] seeks mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not."
1 Kings,20,8,"And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Listen not [unto him] , nor consent."
1 Kings,20,9,"For what reason he said unto the messengers of Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] , Tell my lord the king, All that you i did send for to your i servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again."
1 Kings,20,10,"And Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Shomron [watch mountain] shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me."
1 Kings,20,11,"And the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] answered and said, Tell [him] , Let not him that put on [his harness] boast himself as he that puts it off."
1 Kings,20,12,"And it came to pass, when [Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad]] heard this message, as he [was] drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set [yourselves in array (to put on; to clothe)] . And they set [themselves in array (to put on; to clothe)] against the city."
1 Kings,20,13,"And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ach’av [father’s brother] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Have you i seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into your i hand this day; and you i shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Kings,20,14,"And Ach’av [father’s brother] said, By whom? And he said, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [Even] by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, you i."
1 Kings,20,15,"Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, [even] all the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [being] seven thousand."
1 Kings,20,16,"And they went out at noon. But Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] [was] drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him."
1 Kings,20,17,"And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Shomron [watch mountain]."
1 Kings,20,18,"And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive."
1 Kings,20,19,"So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them."
1 Kings,20,20,And they killed everyone his man: and the Aram [Syrians] fled; and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] pursued them: and Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] the king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] escaped on an horse with the horsemen.
1 Kings,20,21,"And the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went out, and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Aram [Syrians] with a great slaughter."
1 Kings,20,22,"And the prophet came to the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and said unto him, Go, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you i do: for at the return of the year the king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] will come up against you i."
1 Kings,20,23,"And the servants of the king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] said unto him, Their gods [are] gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they."
1 Kings,20,24,"And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:"
1 Kings,20,25,"And number you i an army, like the army that you i have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, [and] surely we shall be stronger than they. And he listened unto their voice, and did so."
1 Kings,20,26,"And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] numbered the Aram [Syrians] , and went up to Aphek [Enclosure] , to fight against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Kings,20,27,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] pitched before them like two little herds of goats; but the Aram [Syrians] filled the country."
1 Kings,20,28,"And there came a man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and spoke unto the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and said, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Because the Aram [Syrians] have said, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of the hills, but he [is] not God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into your i hand, and you 2f shall know that I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Kings,20,29,"And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And [so] it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] killed of the Aram [Syrians] an hundred thousand footmen in one day."
1 Kings,20,30,"But the rest fled to Aphek [Enclosure] , into the city; and [there] a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men [that were] left. And Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber."
1 Kings,20,31,"And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [are] merciful kings: let us, I pray you i , put sackcloth on our waist, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : perhaps he will save your i life."
1 Kings,20,32,"So they girded sackcloth on their waist, and [put] ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and said, Your 1s servant Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] says, I pray you i , let me live. And he said, [Is] he still alive? he [is] my brother."
1 Kings,20,33,"Now the men did diligently observe whether [anything would come] from him, and did hastily catch [it] : and they said, Your 1s brother Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] . Then he said, Go you 2f , bring him. Then Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot."
1 Kings,20,34,"And [Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad]] said unto him, The cities, which my father took from your i father, I will restore; and you i shall make streets for you i in Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] , as my father made in Shomron [watch mountain] . Then [said Ach’av [father’s brother]] , I will send you i away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away."
1 Kings,20,35,"And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Strike me, I pray you i . And the man refused to strike him."
1 Kings,20,36,"Then said he unto him, Because you i have not obeyed the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , behold, as soon as you i are departed from me, a lion shall slay you i . And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and killed him."
1 Kings,20,37,"Then he found another man, and said, Strike me, I pray you i . And the man struck him, so that in striking a blow he wounded [him]."
1 Kings,20,38,"So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with bandages over his eyes."
1 Kings,20,39,"And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Your 1s servant went out into the thick of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall your i life be for his life, or else you i shall pay a talent (weight of money; weight; gift) of silver."
1 Kings,20,40,"And as your i servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said unto him, So [shall] your i judgment [be] ; yourself have decided [it]."
1 Kings,20,41,"And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] he discerned that he [was] of the prophets."
1 Kings,20,42,"And he said unto him, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Because you i have let go out of [your i ] hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore your i life shall go for his life, and your i people for his people."
1 Kings,20,43,"And the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Shomron [watch mountain]."
1 Kings,21,1,"And it came to pass after these things, [that] Navot [fruits] the Yizre’eli [God Sows] had a vineyard, which [was] in Yizre’el [God Sows] , right next to the palace of Ach’av [father’s brother] king of Shomron [watch mountain]."
1 Kings,21,2,"And Ach’av [father’s brother] spoke unto Navot [fruits] , saying, Give me your i vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it [is] near unto my house: and I will give you i for it a better vineyard than it; [or] , if it seem good to you i , I will give you i the monetary value of it in money."
1 Kings,21,3,"And Navot [fruits] said to Ach’av [father’s brother] , The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto you i."
1 Kings,21,4,"And Ach’av [father’s brother] came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Navot [fruits] the Yizre’eli [God Sows] had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give you i the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread."
1 Kings,21,5,"But Izevel [Ba’al exalts] his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is your i spirit so sad, that you i eat no bread?"
1 Kings,21,6,"And he said unto her, Because I spoke unto Navot [fruits] the Yizre’eli [God Sows] , and said unto him, Give me your i vineyard for money; or else, if it please you i , I will give you i [another] vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give you i my vineyard."
1 Kings,21,7,"And Izevel [Ba’al exalts] his wife said unto him, Do you i now govern the kingdom of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ? arise, [and] eat bread, and let your i heart be merry: I will give you i the vineyard of Navot [fruits] the Yizre’eli [God Sows]."
1 Kings,21,8,"So she wrote letters in Ach’av’s [father’s brother] name, and sealed [them] with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that [were] in his city, dwelling with Navot [fruits]."
1 Kings,21,9,"And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Navot [fruits] on high among the people:"
1 Kings,21,10,"And set two men, sons of Belial [Worthless, Good for Nothing] , before him, to bear witness against him, saying, you i did blaspheme God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] and the king. And [then] carry him out, and stone him, that he may die."
1 Kings,21,11,"And the men of his city, [even] the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Izevel [Ba’al exalts] had sent unto them, [and] as it [was] written in the letters which she had sent unto them."
1 Kings,21,12,"They proclaimed a fast, and set Navot [fruits] on high among the people."
1 Kings,21,13,"And there came in two men, children of Belial [Worthless, Good for Nothing] , and sat before him: and the men of Belial [Worthless, Good for Nothing] witnessed against him, [even] against Navot [fruits] , in the presence of the people, saying, Navot [fruits] did blaspheme God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died."
1 Kings,21,14,"Then they sent to Izevel [Ba’al exalts] , saying, Navot [fruits] is stoned, and is dead."
1 Kings,21,15,"And it came to pass, when Izevel [Ba’al exalts] heard that Navot [fruits] was stoned, and was dead, that Izevel [Ba’al exalts] said to Ach’av [father’s brother] , Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Navot [fruits] the Yizre’eli [God Sows] , which he refused to give you i for money: for Navot [fruits] is not alive, but dead."
1 Kings,21,16,"And it came to pass, when Ach’av [father’s brother] heard that Navot [fruits] was dead, that Ach’av [father’s brother] rose up to go down to the vineyard of Navot [fruits] the Yizre’eli [God Sows] , to take possession of it."
1 Kings,21,17,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came to Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] the Tishbi [captivity] , saying,"
1 Kings,21,18,"Arise, go down to meet Ach’av [father’s brother] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which [is] in Shomron [watch mountain] : behold, [he is] in the vineyard of Navot [fruits] , to which he is gone down to possess it."
1 Kings,21,19,"And you i shall speak unto him, saying, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Have you i killed, and also taken possession? And you i shall speak unto him, saying, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , In the place where dogs licked the blood of Navot [fruits] shall dogs lick your i blood, even yoursi."
1 Kings,21,20,"And Ach’av [father’s brother] said to Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] , Have you i found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found [you i ] : because you i have sold yourself to work evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
1 Kings,21,21,"Behold, I will bring evil upon you i , and will take away your i posterity, and will cut off from Ach’av [father’s brother] him that pisses against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God],"
1 Kings,21,22,"And will make your i house like the house of Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , and like the house of Ba’sha [wicked] the son of Achiyah [brother of Yehovah] , for the provocation with which you i have provoked [me] to anger, and made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin."
1 Kings,21,23,"And of Izevel [Ba’al exalts] also spoke the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, The dogs shall eat Izevel [Ba’al exalts] by the wall of Yizre’el [God Sows]."
1 Kings,21,24,Him that dies of Ach’av [father’s brother] in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dies in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.
1 Kings,21,25,"But there was none like unto Ach’av [father’s brother] , which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , whom Izevel [Ba’al exalts] his wife stirred up."
1 Kings,21,26,"And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all [things] as did the Emori [Highlanders] , whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) cast out before the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Kings,21,27,"And it came to pass, when Ach’av [father’s brother] heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly."
1 Kings,21,28,"And the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came to Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] the Tishbi [captivity] , saying,"
1 Kings,21,29,"See you i how Ach’av [father’s brother] humbles himself before me? because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: [but] in his son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house."
1 Kings,22,1,And they continued three years without war between Aram (Syria) [exalted] and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
1 Kings,22,2,"And it came to pass in the third year, that Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] the king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] came down to the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
1 Kings,22,3,"And the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said unto his servants, Know you 2f that Ramot [Heights] in Gil’ad [Rocky Region] [is] ours, and we do nothing to take it not out of the hand of the king of Aram (Syria) [exalted]?"
1 Kings,22,4,"And he said unto Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] , Will you i go with me to battle to Ramot-Gil’ad [rocky region] ? And Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] said to the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , I [am] as you i [are] , my people as your i people, my horses as your i horses."
1 Kings,22,5,"And Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] said unto the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Enquire, I pray you i , at the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) today."
1 Kings,22,6,"Then the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramot-Gil’ad [rocky region] to battle, or shall I refrain (restrain; refrein from acting)? And they said, Go up; for the Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All Things] shall deliver [it] into the hand of the king."
1 Kings,22,7,"And Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) besides, that we might enquire of him?"
1 Kings,22,8,"And the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said unto Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged], [There is] yet one man, Mikhay’hu [who is like God?] the son of Yimlah [whom God will fill up] , by whom we may enquire of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : but I hate him; for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] said, The king shouldn’t say such a thing."
1 Kings,22,9,"Then the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] called an officer, and said, Quickly bring [here] Mikhay’hu [who is like God?] the son of Yimlah [whom God will fill up]."
1 Kings,22,10,"And the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] the king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in an open place in the entrance of the gate of Shomron [watch mountain] ; and all the prophets prophesied before them."
1 Kings,22,11,"And Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] the son of Kena’anah [trader] made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , With these shall you i push the Aram [Syrians] , until you i have consumed them."
1 Kings,22,12,"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramot-Gil’ad [rocky region] , and prosper: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall deliver [it] into the king’s hand."
1 Kings,22,13,"And the messenger that was gone to call Mikhay’hu [who is like God?] spoke unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets [declare] good unto the king with one mouth: let your i word, I pray you i , be like the word of one of them, and speak [that which is] good."
1 Kings,22,14,"And Mikhay’hu [who is like God?] said, [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, what the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) says unto me, that will I speak."
1 Kings,22,15,"So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Mikhay’hu [who is like God?] , shall we go against Ramot-Gil’ad [rocky region] to battle, or shall we hold off? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall deliver [it] into the hand of the king."
1 Kings,22,16,"And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure (to command under oath or threat) you i that you i tell me nothing but [that which is] true in the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)?"
1 Kings,22,17,"And he said, I saw all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace."
1 Kings,22,18,"And the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said unto Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] , Did I not tell you i that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?"
1 Kings,22,19,"And he said, Hear you i therefore the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : I saw the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left."
1 Kings,22,20,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, Who shall persuade Ach’av [father’s brother] , that he may go up and fall at Ramot-Gil’ad [rocky region] ? And one said do it this way, and another said do it this way."
1 Kings,22,21,"And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, I will persuade (entice) him."
1 Kings,22,22,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto him, How? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And He said, you i shall persuade [him] , and prevail also: go forth, and do so."
1 Kings,22,23,"Now therefore, behold, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your i prophets, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has spoken evil concerning you i."
1 Kings,22,24,"But Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] the son of Kena’anah [trader] went near, and struck Mikhay’hu [who is like God?] on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) from me to speak to you i?"
1 Kings,22,25,"And Mikhay’hu [who is like God?] said, Behold, you i shall find out in that day, when you i shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself."
1 Kings,22,26,"And the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said, Take Mikhay’hu [who is like God?] , and carry him back unto ‘Amon [master workman] the governor of the city, and to Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] the king’s son;"
1 Kings,22,27,"And say, Thus says the king, Put this [fellow] in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace."
1 Kings,22,28,"And Mikhay’hu [who is like God?] said, If you i return at all in peace, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has not spoken by me. And he said, Listen, O people, everyone of you."
1 Kings,22,29,So the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] the king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] went up to Ramot-Gil’ad [rocky region].
1 Kings,22,30,"And the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said unto Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] , I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put you i on your i robes.
