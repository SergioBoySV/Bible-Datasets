Nehemiah,1,1,"The words of Nechemyah [God comforts] the son of Hakhalyah [whom Yehovah enlightens] . And it came to pass in the month Kislev [his confidence] , in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan [lily] the palace,"
Nehemiah,1,2,"That Hanani [gracious] , one of my brethren, came, he and [certain] men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ; and I asked them concerning the Y’hudim (Judeans) that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Nehemiah,1,3,"And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province [are] in great affliction and reproach (disgrace; shame) : the wall of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] also [is] broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire."
Nehemiah,1,4,"And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned [certain] days, and fasted, and prayed before the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of heaven,"
Nehemiah,1,5,"And said, I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of heaven, the great and terrible God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , that keeps covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:"
Nehemiah,1,6,"Let you i ear now be attentive, and you i eyes open, that you i may hear the prayer of you i servant, which I pray before you i now, day and night, for the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] you i servants, and confess the sins of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which we have sinned against you i : both I and my father’s house have sinned."
Nehemiah,1,7,"We have dealt very corruptly against you i , and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which you i commanded you i servant Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Nehemiah,1,8,"Remember, I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , the word that you i commanded you i servant Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying, [If] you 2f transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:"
Nehemiah,1,9,"But [if] you 2f turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, [yet] will I gather them from there, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there."
Nehemiah,1,10,"Now these [are] you i servants and you i people, whom you i have redeemed by you i great power, and by you i strong hand."
Nehemiah,1,11,"O Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All Things] , I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , let now you i ear be attentive to the prayer of you i servant, and to the prayer of you i servants, who desire to fear you i name: and prosper, I pray you i , you i servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king’s cupbearer."
Nehemiah,2,1,"And it came to pass in the month Nisan [their flight] , in the twentieth year of Artach’shashta [I will make the spoiled to boil: I will stir myself (in) winter] the king, [that] wine [was] before him: and I took up the wine, and gave [it] unto the king. Now I had not been [formerly] sad in his presence."
Nehemiah,2,2,"For what reason the king said unto me, Why [is] you i Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor) sad, seeing you i [are] not sick? this [is] nothing [else] but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,"
Nehemiah,2,3,"And said unto the king, Let the king live forever: why should not my Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor) be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ sepulchres, [lies] waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?"
Nehemiah,2,4,"Then the king said unto me, For what do you i make request? So I prayed to the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of heaven."
Nehemiah,2,5,"And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if you i servant have found favour in you i sight, that you i would send me unto Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it."
Nehemiah,2,6,"And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall you i journey be? and when will you i return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time."
Nehemiah,2,7,"Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised];"
Nehemiah,2,8,"And a letter unto Asaf [gatherer] the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which [appertained] to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] upon me."
Nehemiah,2,9,"Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me."
Nehemiah,2,10,"When Sanvalat [strength] the Horoni [native of twin caves] , and Toviyah [Yehovah is good] the servant, the ‘Amoni [tribal] , heard [of it] , it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Nehemiah,2,11,"So I came to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and was there three days."
Nehemiah,2,12,"And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I [any] man what my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had put in my heart to do at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : neither [was there any] beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon."
Nehemiah,2,13,"And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire."
Nehemiah,2,14,"Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king’s pool: but [there was] no place for the beast [that was] under me to pass."
Nehemiah,2,15,"Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and [so] returned."
Nehemiah,2,16,"And the rulers knew not to which I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told [it] to the Y’hudim (Judeans) , nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work."
Nehemiah,2,17,"Then said I unto them, You 2f see the distress that we [are] in, how Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] [lies] waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , that we be no more a reproach (disgrace; shame)."
Nehemiah,2,18,"Then I told them of the hand of my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] which was good upon me; as also the king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for [this] good [work]."
Nehemiah,2,19,"But when Sanvalat [strength] the Horoni [native of twin caves] , and Toviyah [Yehovah is good] the servant, the ‘Amoni [tribal] , and Geshem [rain] the Aravi [Arabian] , heard [it] , they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What [is] this thing that you 2f do? will you 2f rebel against the king?"
Nehemiah,2,20,"Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but you 2f have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Nehemiah,3,1,"Then Elyashiv [God restores] the High Priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they built the Sheep Gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Me’ah [hundred] they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hanan’el [God has favoured]."
Nehemiah,3,2,And next unto him built the men of Yericho [Its Moon] . And next to them built Zakur [Mindful] the son of Imri [eloquent].
Nehemiah,3,3,"But the fish gate did the sons of Hasna’ah [thorny] build, who [also] laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof."
Nehemiah,3,4,"And next unto them repaired M’remot [elevations] the son of Uriyah [Yehovah is my flame] , the son of Hakotz [thorn] . And next unto them repaired Meshulam [friend] the son of Berekhyah [Yehovah blesses] , the son of Mesheizav’el [God delivers] . And next unto them repaired Tzadok [righteous] the son of Ba’ana [in the affliction]."
Nehemiah,3,5,And next unto them the T’koi [trumpet blast] repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord-Adon [Lord of the Earth].
Nehemiah,3,6,"Moreover the old gate repaired Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] the son of Paseach [limper] , and Meshulam [friend] the son of B’sodyah [with the counsel of Yehovah] ; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof."
Nehemiah,3,7,"And next unto them repaired M’latyah [Yehovah delivered] the Giv’oni [little hill: hilly] , and Yadon [thankful] the Meronoti [joyful shouter] , the men of Giv’on [Hill City] , and of Mitzpah [watchtower] , unto the throne of the governor on this side the river."
Nehemiah,3,8,"Next unto him repaired Uzziel [My Strength is God] the son of Harhayah [fear of Yehovah] , of the goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananyah [God has favoured] the son of [one of] the apothecaries, and they fortified Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] unto the broad wall."
Nehemiah,3,9,"And next unto them repaired Refayah [healed of Yehovah] the son of Hur [Liberty] , the ruler of the half part of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."

Nehemiah,3,13,"The valley gate repaired Hanun [gracious] , and the inhabitants of Zanoach [Cast Off] ; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate."
Nehemiah,3,14,"But the dung gate repaired Malkiyah [my king is Yehovah] the son of Rekhav [rider] , the ruler of part of Beit-Hakerem [house of the vineyard] ; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof."
Nehemiah,3,15,"But the gate of the fountain repaired Shalun [retribution] the son of Kol-Hozah [all-seeing] , the ruler of part of Mitzpah [watchtower] ; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the Pool of Shelach [sent] by the king’s garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the city of David [beloved]."
Nehemiah,3,16,"After him repaired Nechemyah [God comforts] the son of Azbuk [strong devistation] , the ruler of the half part of Beit’Tzur [House of the Rock] , unto [the place] over against the sepulchres of David [beloved] , and to the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty."

Nehemiah,3,21,"After him repaired M’remot [elevations] the son of Uriyah [Yehovah is my flame] the son of Hakotz [thorn] another piece, from the door of the house of Elyashiv [God restores] even to the end of the house of Elyashiv [God restores]."
Nehemiah,3,22,"And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain."
Nehemiah,3,23,After him repaired Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] and Hashuv [considerate] over against their house. After him repaired ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] the son of Ma’aseiyah [work of Yehovah] the son of ‘Ananyah [Yehovah clouds] by his house.
Nehemiah,3,24,"After him repaired Binui [built up] the son of Henadad [favour of Hadad] another piece, from the house of ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] unto the turning [of the wall] , even unto the corner."
Nehemiah,3,25,"Palal [judge] the son of Uzai [I shall have my sprinklings] , over against the turning [of the wall] , and the tower which lies out from the king’s high house, that [was] by the court of the prison. After him P’dayah [Yehovah has ransomed] the son of Par’osh [flea]."
Nehemiah,3,26,"Moreover the temple servants dwelt in ‘Ofel [hill] , unto [the place] over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lies out."
Nehemiah,3,27,"After them the T’koi [trumpet blast] repaired another piece, over against the great tower that lies out, even unto the wall of ‘Ofel [hill]."
Nehemiah,3,28,"From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house."
Nehemiah,3,29,"After them repaired Tzadok [righteous] the son of Immer [he has said] over against his house. After him repaired also Sh’may’yah [Yehovah hears] the son of Sh’khanyah [dweller with Yehovah] , the keeper of the east gate."

Nehemiah,3,31,"After him repaired Malkiyah [my king is Yehovah] the goldsmith’s son unto the place of the temple servants, and of the merchants, over against the Gate Mif’kad [command] , and to the going up of the corner."
Nehemiah,3,32,And between the going up of the corner unto the Sheep Gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.
Nehemiah,4,1,"But it came to pass, that when Sanvalat [strength] heard that we built the wall, he was exceedingly angry, and took great indignation, and mocked the Y’hudim (Judeans)."
Nehemiah,4,2,"And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Shomron [watch mountain] , and said, What do these feeble Y’hudim (Judeans) ? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?"
Nehemiah,4,3,"Now Toviyah [Yehovah is good] the ‘Amoni [tribal] [was] by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall."
Nehemiah,4,4,"Hear, O our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; for we are despised: and turn their reproach (disgrace; shame) upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:"
Nehemiah,4,5,"And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before you i : for they have provoked [you i ] to anger before the builders."
Nehemiah,4,6,So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.
Nehemiah,4,7,"But it came to pass, [that] when Sanvalat [strength] , and Toviyah [Yehovah is good] , and the Arabians, and the ‘Amon [Inbred] , and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] were made up, [and] that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very exceedingly angry,"
Nehemiah,4,8,"And conspired all of them together to come [and] to fight against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and to hinder it."
Nehemiah,4,9,"Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and set a watch against them day and night, because of them."
Nehemiah,4,10,"And Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and [there is] much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall."
Nehemiah,4,11,"And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease."
Nehemiah,4,12,"And it came to pass, that when the Y’hudim (Judeans) which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places from what place you 2f shall return unto us [they will be upon you]."
Nehemiah,4,13,"Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, [and] on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows."
Nehemiah,4,14,"And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not you 2f afraid of them: remember the Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All Things], [which is] great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses."
Nehemiah,4,15,"And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had brought their counsel to nothing, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work."
Nehemiah,4,16,"And it came to pass from that time forth, [that] the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers [were] behind all the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
Nehemiah,4,17,"They which built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, with those that laded, [every one] with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other [hand] held a weapon."
Nehemiah,4,18,"For the builders, everyone had his sword girded by his side, and [so] built. And he that sounded the trumpet [was] by me."
Nehemiah,4,19,"And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work [is] great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another."
Nehemiah,4,20,"In what place [therefore] you 2f hear the sound of the trumpet, resort you 2f there unto us: our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shall fight for us."
Nehemiah,4,21,So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
Nehemiah,4,22,"Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let everyone with his servant lodge within Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day."
Nehemiah,4,23,"So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, [saving that] every one put them off for washing."
Nehemiah,5,1,And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Y’hudim (Judeans).
Nehemiah,5,2,"For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, [are] many: therefore we take up corn [for them] , that we may eat, and live."
Nehemiah,5,3," [Some] also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the famine."
Nehemiah,5,4,"There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute, [and that upon] our lands and vineyards."
Nehemiah,5,5,"Yet now our flesh [is] as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and [some] of our daughters are brought unto bondage [already] : neither [is it] in our power [to redeem them] ; for other men have our lands and vineyards."
Nehemiah,5,6,And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
Nehemiah,5,7,"Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, You 2f exact usury (interest paid for using money) , every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them."
Nehemiah,5,8,"And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Y’hudim (Judeans) , which were sold unto the heathen; and will you 2f even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing [to answer]."
Nehemiah,5,9,"Also I said, It [is] not good that you 2f do: ought you 2f not to walk in the fear of our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] because of the reproach (disgrace; shame) of the heathen our enemies?"
Nehemiah,5,10,"I likewise, [and] my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury (interest paid for using money)."
Nehemiah,5,11,"Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth [part] of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that you 2f exact of them."
Nehemiah,5,12,"Then said they, We will restore [them] , and will require nothing of them; so will we do as you i say. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise."
Nehemiah,5,13,"Also I shook my lap, and said, So God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performs not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . And the people did according to this promise."
Nehemiah,5,14,"Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artach’shashta [I will make the spoiled to boil: I will stir myself (in) winter] the king, [that is] , twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor."
Nehemiah,5,15,"But the former governors that [had been] before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yes, even their servants bore rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Nehemiah,5,16,"Yes, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants [were] gathered there unto the work."
Nehemiah,5,17,"Moreover [there were] at my table an hundred and fifty of the Y’hudim (Judeans) and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that [are] about us."
Nehemiah,5,18,"Now [that] which was prepared [for me] daily [was] one ox [and] six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people."
Nehemiah,5,19,"Think upon me, my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , for good, [according] to all that I have done for this people."
Nehemiah,6,1,"Now it came to pass, when Sanvalat [strength] , and Toviyah [Yehovah is good] , and Geshem [rain] the Aravi [Arabian] , and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and [that] there was no breach (breaking forth; a break; opening, inlet) left in it; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)"
Nehemiah,6,2,"That Sanvalat [strength] and Geshem [rain] sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in [some one of] the villages in the plain of Ono [vigorous] . But they thought to do me mischief."
Nehemiah,6,3,"And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I [am] doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?"
Nehemiah,6,4,Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
Nehemiah,6,5,Then sent Sanvalat [strength] his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;
Nehemiah,6,6,"Wherein [was] written, It is reported among the heathen, and Geshemu [rain] says [it, that] you i and the Y’hudim (Judeans) think to rebel: for which cause you i build the wall, that you i may be their king, according to these words."
Nehemiah,6,7,"And you i have also appointed prophets to preach of you i at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , saying, [There is] a king in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] : and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together."
Nehemiah,6,8,"Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as you i say, but you i pretend them out of you i own heart."
Nehemiah,6,9,"For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, [O God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]] , strengthen my hands."
Nehemiah,6,10,"Afterward I came unto the house of Sh’may’yah [Yehovah hears] the son of D’layahu [Yehovah has accomplished] the son of M’heitav’el [Favoured of God] , who [was] shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay you i ; yes, in the night will they come to slay you i."
Nehemiah,6,11,"And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who [is there] , that, [being] as I [am] , would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in."
Nehemiah,6,12,"And, lo, I perceived that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Toviyah [Yehovah is good] and Sanvalat [strength] had hired him."
Nehemiah,6,13,"Therefore [was] he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and [that] they might have [matter] for an evil report, that they might reproach (disgrace; shame) me."
Nehemiah,6,14,"My God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , think you i upon Toviyah [Yehovah is good] and Sanvalat [strength] according to these their works, and on the prophetess No’adyah [meeting with Yehovah] , and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear."
Nehemiah,6,15,"So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty and two days."
Nehemiah,6,16,"And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard [thereof] , and all the heathen that [were] about us saw [these things] , they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Nehemiah,6,17,"Moreover in those days the nobles of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] sent many letters unto Toviyah [Yehovah is good] , and [the letters] of Toviyah [Yehovah is good] came unto them."
Nehemiah,6,18,"For [there were] many in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] sworn unto him, because he [was] the son in law of Sh’khanyah [dweller with Yehovah] the son of Arach [traveller] ; and his son Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] had taken the daughter of Meshulam [friend] the son of Berekhyah [Yehovah blesses]."
Nehemiah,6,19,"Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. [And] Toviyah [Yehovah is good] sent letters to put me in fear."

And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) with [their] faces to the ground."

Nehemiah,8,9,"And Nechemyah [God comforts] , which [is] the Tirshata [governor] , and ‘the priest the scribe, and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day [is] holy unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law."
Nehemiah,8,10,"Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for [this] day [is] holy unto our Lord: neither be you 2f sorry; for the joy of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) is your strength."
Nehemiah,8,11,"So the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day [is] holy; neither be you 2f grieved."
Nehemiah,8,12,"And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great gladness, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them."
Nehemiah,8,13,"And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , unto ‘the scribe, even to understand the words of the law."
Nehemiah,8,14,"And they found written in the law which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had commanded by Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , that the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:"
Nehemiah,8,15,"And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as [it is] written."
Nehemiah,8,16,"So the people went forth, and brought [them] , and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful]."
Nehemiah,8,17,"And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Yeshua [he is saved] the son of Nun [Posterity] unto that day had not the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] done so. And there was very great gladness."
Nehemiah,8,18,"Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] . And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day [was] a solemn assembly, according unto the manner."
Nehemiah,9,1,"Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them."
Nehemiah,9,2,"And the seed of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers."
Nehemiah,9,3,"And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [one] fourth part of the day; and [another] fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Nehemiah,9,4,"Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , Yeshua [he is saved] , and Bani [built] , Kadmi’el [God is the ancient one] , Sh’vanyah [increased by Yehovah] , Buni [built] , Sherevyah [Yehovah has scorched] , Bani [built], [and] K’nani [my station] , and cried with a loud voice unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Nehemiah,9,5,"Then the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , Yeshua [he is saved] , and Kadmi’el [God is the ancient one] , Bani [built] , Hashavn’yah [whom Yehovah regards] , Sherevyah [Yehovah has scorched] , Hodiyah [my majesty is Yehovah] , Sh’vanyah [increased by Yehovah], [and] P’tachyah [freed by Yehovah] , said, Stand up [and] bless the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] forever and ever: and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) be you i glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise."
Nehemiah,9,6,"you i, [even] you i, [are] Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) alone; you i have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all [things] that [are] in it, the seas, and all that [is] in it, and you i preserve them all; and the army of heaven worships you i."
Nehemiah,9,7,"you i [are] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , who did choose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] [clod-breakers] , and gave him the name of Avraham [Exalted Father];"
Nehemiah,9,8,"And found his heart faithful before you i , and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Kena’ani [Merchant] , the Hitti [Terrorists] , the Emori [Highlanders] , and the P’rizi [Dwellers in Unwalled Towns] , and the Y’vusi [Threshers, Trampled Under Foot] , and the Girgashi [Dwelling on Clay Soil] , to give [it, I say] , to his seed, and have performed you i words; for you i [are] righteous:"
Nehemiah,9,9,"And did see the affliction of our fathers in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and heard their cry by the Red sea;"
Nehemiah,9,10,"And showed signs and wonders upon Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] , and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for you i knew that they dealt proudly against them. So did you i get yourselfi a name, as [it is] this day."
Nehemiah,9,11,"And you i did divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors you i threw into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters."
Nehemiah,9,12,"Moreover you i led them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go."
Nehemiah,9,13,"you i came down also upon mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:"
Nehemiah,9,14,"And made known unto them you i holy Shabbat [Rest] , and commanded them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] you i servant:"
Nehemiah,9,15,"And gave them bread from heaven for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promised them that they should go in to possess the land which you i had sworn to give them."
Nehemiah,9,16,"But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and listened not to you i commandments,"
Nehemiah,9,17,"And refused to obey, neither were mindful of you i wonders that you i did among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but you i [are] a God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsook them not."
Nehemiah,9,18,"Yes, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This [is] you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] that brought you i up out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and had wrought great provocations;"
Nehemiah,9,19,"Yet you i in your i manifold mercies forsook them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go."
Nehemiah,9,20,"you i gave also your i good spirit to instruct them, and withheld not your i manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst."
Nehemiah,9,21,"Yes, forty years did you i sustain them in the wilderness, [so that] they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not."
Nehemiah,9,22,"Moreover you i gave them kingdoms and nations, and did divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sichon [Warrior] , and the land of the king of Heshbon [Stronghold] , and the land of ‘Og [Long-necked] king of Bashan [Fruitful]."
Nehemiah,9,23,"Their children also multiplied you i as the stars of heaven, and brought them into the land, concerning which you i had promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess [it]."
Nehemiah,9,24,"So the children went in and possessed the land, and you i subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Kena’ani [Merchant] , and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would."
Nehemiah,9,25,"And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells excavated, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in you i great goodness."
Nehemiah,9,26,"Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you i , and cast you i law behind their backs, and killed you i prophets which testified against them to turn them to you i , and they wrought great provocations."
Nehemiah,9,27,"Therefore you i delivered them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto you i , you i heard [them] from heaven; and according to you i manifold mercies you i gave them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies."
Nehemiah,9,28,"But after they had rest, they did evil again before you i : therefore left you i them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto you i , you i heard [them] from heaven; and many times did you i deliver them according to you i mercies;"
Nehemiah,9,29,"And testified against them, that you i might bring them again unto you i law: yet they dealt proudly, and listened not unto you i commandments, but sinned against you i judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear."
Nehemiah,9,30,"Yet many years did you i refrain (restrain; refrein from acting) them, and testified against them by you i spirit in you i prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gave you i them into the hand of the people of the lands."
Nehemiah,9,31,"Nevertheless for you i great mercies’ sake you i did not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for you i [are] a gracious and merciful God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Nehemiah,9,32,"Now therefore, our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , the great, the mighty, and the terrible God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , who keeps covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before you i , that has come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all you i people, since the time of the kings of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) unto this day."
Nehemiah,9,33,"However you i [are] just in all that is brought upon us; for you i have done right, but we have done wickedly:"
Nehemiah,9,34,"Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept you i law, nor listened unto you i commandments and you i testimonies, which you i did testify against them."
Nehemiah,9,35,"For they have not served you i in their kingdom, and in you i great goodness that you i gave them, and in the large and fat land which you i gave before them, neither turned they from their wicked works."
Nehemiah,9,36,"Behold, we [are] servants this day, and [for] the land that you i gave unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we [are] servants in it:"
Nehemiah,9,37,"And it yielded much increase unto the kings whom you i have set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we [are] in great distress."
Nehemiah,9,38,"And because of all this we make a sure [covenant] , and write [it] ; and our princes, Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to], [and] priests, seal [unto it]."

Nehemiah,13,6,"But in all this [time] was not I at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : for in the two and thirtieth year of Artach’shashta [I will make the spoiled to boil: I will stir myself (in) winter] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:"
Nehemiah,13,7,"And I came to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and understood of the evil that Elyashiv [God restores] did for Toviyah [Yehovah is good] , in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Nehemiah,13,8,And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Toviyah [Yehovah is good] out of the chamber.
Nehemiah,13,9,"Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and there brought I again the vessels of the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , with the meat offering and the frankincense."
Nehemiah,13,10,"And I perceived that the portions of the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] had not been given [them] : for the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] and the singers, that did the work, were fled everyone to his field."
Nehemiah,13,11,"Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place."
Nehemiah,13,12,Then brought all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] the tithe of the corn and the New Wine and the oil unto the treasuries.
Nehemiah,13,13,"And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemyah [repaid by Yehovah] [repaid by Yehovah] the priest, and Tzadok [righteous] the scribe, and of the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , P’dayah [Yehovah has ransomed] : and next to them [was] Hanan [he is merciful] the son of Zakur [Mindful] , the son of Matanyah [gift of Yehovah] : for they were counted faithful, and their office [was] to distribute unto their brethren."
Nehemiah,13,14,"Remember me, O my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and for the offices thereof."
Nehemiah,13,15,"In those days saw I in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] [some] treading wine presses on the Shabbat [Rest] , and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all [manner of] burdens, which they brought into Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] on the Shabbat [Rest] day: and I testified [against them] in the day wherein they sold victuals (food for humans)."
Nehemiah,13,16,"There dwelt men of Tzor (Tyre) [a rock] also in it, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the Shabbat [Rest] unto the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Nehemiah,13,17,"Then I contended with the nobles of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and said unto them, What evil thing [is] this that you 2f do, and Profane (treat as common; defile) the Shabbat [Rest] day?"
Nehemiah,13,18,"Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet you 2f bring more wrath upon Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] by profaning the Shabbat [Rest]."
Nehemiah,13,19,"And it came to pass, that when the gates of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] began to be dark before the Shabbat [Rest] , I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the Shabbat [Rest] : and [some] of my servants set I at the gates, [that] there should no burden be brought in on the Shabbat [Rest] day."
Nehemiah,13,20,So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] once or twice.
Nehemiah,13,21,"Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge you 2f about the wall? if you 2f do [so] again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no [more] on the Shabbat [Rest]."
Nehemiah,13,22,"And I commanded the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] that they should cleanse themselves, and [that] they should come [and] keep the gates, to sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) the Shabbat [Rest] day. Remember me, O my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered], [concerning] this also, and spare me according to the greatness of you i mercy."
Nehemiah,13,23,"In those days also saw I Y’hudim (Judeans) [that] had married wives of Ashdod [powerful] , of ‘Amon [Inbred], [and] of Mo’av [Seed of my Father]:"
Nehemiah,13,24,"And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod [powerful] , and could not speak in the Y’hudit (Y’hudim (Judeans)) language, but according to the language of each people."
Nehemiah,13,25,"And I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered], [saying] , You 2f shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves."
Nehemiah,13,26,"Did not Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] made him king over all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin."
Nehemiah,13,27,"Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in marrying strange wives?"
Nehemiah,13,28,"And [one] of the sons of Yoyada [Yehovah knows] , the son of Elyashiv [God restores] the High Priest, [was] son in law to Sanvalat [strength] the Horoni [native of twin caves] : therefore I chased him from me."
Nehemiah,13,29,"Remember them, O my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to]."
Nehemiah,13,30,"Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , everyone in his business;"
Nehemiah,13,31,"And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , for good."
