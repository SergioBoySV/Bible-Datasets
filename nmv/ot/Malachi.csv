Malachi,1,1,The burden of the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] by Mal’akh [My messenger].
Malachi,1,2,"I have loved you, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . Yet you 2f say, Wherein have you i loved us? [Was] not ‘Esav [Hairy] Ya’akov [Heal of God] ’s brother? says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : yet I loved Ya’akov [Heal of God],"
Malachi,1,3,"And I hated ‘Esav [Hairy] , and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness."
Malachi,1,4,"Whereas Edom [Red] says, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has indignation forever."
Malachi,1,5,"And your eyes shall see, and you 2f shall say, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will be magnified from the border of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Malachi,1,6,"A son honors [his] father, and a servant his master: if then I [be] a father, where [is] my honour? and if I [be] a master, where [is] my fear? says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And you 2f say, Wherein have we despised you i name?"
Malachi,1,7,"You 2f offer polluted bread upon my altar; and you 2f say, Wherein have we polluted you i ? In that you 2f say, The table of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] contemptible."
Malachi,1,8,"And if you 2f offer the blind for sacrifice, [is it] not evil? and if you 2f offer the lame and sick, [is it] not evil? offer it now unto you i governor; will he be pleased with you i , or accept you i person? says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Malachi,1,9,"And now, I pray you, beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] that he will be gracious unto us: this has been by your means: will he regard your persons? says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Malachi,1,10,"Who [is there] even among you that would shut the doors [for nothing] ? neither do you 2f kindle [fire] on my altar for nothing. I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , neither will I accept an offering at your hand."
Malachi,1,11,"For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name [shall be] great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense [shall be] offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name [shall be] great among the heathen, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Malachi,1,12,"But you 2f have profaned it, in that you 2f say, The table of the Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All] [is] polluted; and the fruit thereof, [even] his meat, [is] contemptible."
Malachi,1,13,"You 2f said also, Behold, what a weariness [is it] ! and you 2f have snuffed at it, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] ; and you 2f brought [that which was] torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus you 2f brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Malachi,1,14,"But cursed [be] the deceiver, which has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I [am] a great King, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , and my name [is] dreadful among the heathen."
Malachi,2,1,"And now, O you 2f priests, this commandment [is] for you."
Malachi,2,2,"If you 2f will not hear, and if you 2f will not lay [it] to heart, to give glory unto my name, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yes, I have cursed them already, because you 2f do not lay [it] to heart."
Malachi,2,3,"Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, [even] the dung of your solemn feasts; and [one] shall take you away with it."
Malachi,2,4,"And you 2f shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] , says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Malachi,2,5,"My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him [for] the fear which he feared me, and was afraid before my name."
Malachi,2,6,"The law of twas in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity."
Malachi,2,7,"For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the Torah at his mouth: for he [is] the messenger of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Malachi,2,8,"But you 2f are departed out of the way; you 2f have caused many to stumble at the law; you 2f have corrupted the covenant of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] , says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Malachi,2,9,"Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as you 2f have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law."
Malachi,2,10,"Have we not all one father? has not one God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?"
Malachi,2,11,"Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; for Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] has profaned the holiness of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) which he loved, and has married the daughter of a strange god."
Malachi,2,12,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will cut off the man that does this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Ya’akov [Heal of God] , and him that offers an offering unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Malachi,2,13,"And this have you 2f done again, covering the altar of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regards not the offering any more, or receives [it] with good will at your hand."
Malachi,2,14,"Yet you 2f say, For what reason? Because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has been witness between you i and the wife of you i youth, against whom you i have dealt treacherously: yet [is] she you i companion, and the wife of you i covenant."
Malachi,2,15,"And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue (part that remains, the rest) of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth."
Malachi,2,16,"For the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , says that he hates putting away: for [one] covers violence with his garment, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] : therefore take heed to your spirit, that you 2f deal not treacherously."
Malachi,2,17,"You 2f have wearied the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) with your words. Yet you 2f say, Wherein have we wearied [him] ? When you 2f say, Every one that does evil [is] good in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and he delights in them; or, Where [is] the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of judgment?"
Malachi,3,1,"Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord-Adon [Ruler of the Earth] , whom you 2f seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you 2f delight in: behold, he shall come, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Malachi,3,2,"But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appears? for he [is] like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap:"
Malachi,3,3,"And he shall sit [as] a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] , and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) an offering in righteousness."
Malachi,3,4,"Then shall the offering of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] be pleasant unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , as in the days of old, and as in former years."
Malachi,3,5,"And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the employee (hired laborer) in [his] wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger [from his right] , and fear not me, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Malachi,3,6,"For I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , I change not; therefore you 2f sons of Ya’akov [Heal of God] are not consumed."
Malachi,3,7,"Even from the days of your fathers you 2f are gone away from my ordinances, and have not kept [them] . Return unto me, and I will return unto you, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] . But you 2f said, Wherein shall we return?"
Malachi,3,8,"Will a man rob God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ? Yet you 2f have robbed me. But you 2f say, Wherein have we robbed you i ? In tithes and offerings."
Malachi,3,9,"You 2f [are] cursed with a curse: for you 2f have robbed me, [even] this whole nation."
Malachi,3,10,"Bring you 2f all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in my house, and prove me now with this, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that [there shall] not [be room] enough [to receive it]."
Malachi,3,11,"And I will rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Malachi,3,12,"And all nations shall call you Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) : for you 2f shall be a delightsome land, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Malachi,3,13,"Your words have been stout against me, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . Yet you 2f say, What have we spoken [so much] against you i?"
Malachi,3,14,"You 2f have said, It [is] vain to serve God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : and what profit [is it] that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]?"
Malachi,3,15,"And now we call the proud happy; yes, they that work wickedness are set up; yes, [they that] tempt God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] are even delivered."
Malachi,3,16,"Then they that feared the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke often one to another: and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) listened, and heard [it] , and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and that thought upon his name."
Malachi,3,17,"And they shall be my, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son that serves him."
Malachi,3,18,"Then shall you 2f return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serves God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] and him that serves him not."
Malachi,4,1,"For, behold, the day comes, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yes, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that comes shall burn them up, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] , that it shall leave them neither root nor branch."
Malachi,4,2,"But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and you 2f shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall."
Malachi,4,3,"And you 2f shall trample down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do [this] , says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]."
Malachi,4,4,"Remember you 2f the law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horev [Desert] for all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [with] the statutes and judgments."
Malachi,4,5,"Behold, I will send you Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):"
Malachi,4,6,"And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with utter destruction."
