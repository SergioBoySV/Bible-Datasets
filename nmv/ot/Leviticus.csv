Leviticus,7,11,"And this [is] the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Leviticus,7,12,"If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried."
Leviticus,7,13,"Besides the cakes, he shall offer [for] his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings."
Leviticus,7,14,"And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation [for] an heave offering unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [and] it shall be the priest’s that sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings."
Leviticus,7,15,And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.
Leviticus,7,16,"But if the sacrifice of his offering [be] a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:"
Leviticus,7,17,But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.
Leviticus,7,18,"And if [any] of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offers it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eats of it shall bear his iniquity."
Leviticus,7,19,"And the flesh that touches any unclean [thing] shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof."
Leviticus,7,20,"But the soul that eats [of] the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that [pertain] unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,7,21,"Moreover the soul that shall to (to do entirely, do wholly) uch any unclean [thing, as] the uncleanness of man, or [any] unclean beast, or any abominable unclean [thing] , and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which [pertain] unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , even that soul shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,7,22,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying,"
Leviticus,7,23,"Speak unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, You 2f shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat."
Leviticus,7,24,"And the fat of the beast that dies of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but you 2f shall assuredly not (by no means) eat of it."
Leviticus,7,25,"For whosoever eats the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , even the soul that eats [it] shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,7,26,"Moreover you 2f shall eat no manner of blood, [whether it be] of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings."
Leviticus,7,27,"Whatsoever soul [it be] that eats any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,7,28,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying,"
Leviticus,7,29,"Speak unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, He that offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall bring his oblation unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) of the sacrifice of his peace offerings."
Leviticus,7,30,"His own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved [for] a wave offering before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Leviticus,7,31,"And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aharon [Bright, Very High] ’s and his sons’."
Leviticus,7,32,And the right shoulder shall you 2f give unto the priest [for] an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
Leviticus,7,33,"He among the sons of Aharon [Bright, Very High] , that offers the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for [his] part."
Leviticus,7,34,"For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aharon [Bright, Very High] the priest and unto his sons by a statute forever from among the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Leviticus,7,35,"This [is the portion] of the anointing of Aharon [Bright, Very High] , and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) made by fire, in the day [when] he presented them to minister unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in the priest’s office;"
Leviticus,7,36,"Which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded to be given them of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , in the day that he anointed them, [by] a statute forever throughout their generations."
Leviticus,7,37,"This [is] the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;"
Leviticus,7,38,"Which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to offer their oblations unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , in the wilderness of Sinai."
Leviticus,8,1,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying,"
Leviticus,8,2,"Take Aharon [Bright, Very High] and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;"
Leviticus,8,3,And gather you i all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
Leviticus,8,4,And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] did as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
Leviticus,8,5,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto the congregation, This [is] the thing which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded to be done."
Leviticus,8,6,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] brought Aharon [Bright, Very High] and his sons, and washed them with water."
Leviticus,8,7,"And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the belt, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod (vest) upon him, and he girded him with the detailed (skillfully made) belt of the ephod (vest) , and bound [it] unto him with that."
Leviticus,8,8,And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim [Lights] and the Tumim [Perfection].
Leviticus,8,9,"And he put the mitre (turban; ceremonial headdress) upon his head; also upon the mitre (turban; ceremonial headdress), [even] upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Leviticus,8,10,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that [was] in it, and sanctified them."
Leviticus,8,11,"And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the Wash basin and his foot, to sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) them."
Leviticus,8,12,"And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aharon [Bright, Very High] ’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) him."
Leviticus,8,13,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] brought Aharon [Bright, Very High] ’s sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Leviticus,8,14,"And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aharon [Bright, Very High] and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering."
Leviticus,8,15,"And he killed [it] ; and Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] took the blood, and put [it] upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it."
Leviticus,8,16,"And he took all the fat that [was] upon the inwards, and the caul (membrane; fatty tissue around a bodily organ) [above] the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] burned [it] upon the altar."
Leviticus,8,17,"But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Leviticus,8,18,"And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aharon [Bright, Very High] and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram."
Leviticus,8,19,And he killed [it] ; and Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus,8,20,"And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat."
Leviticus,8,21,"And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it [was] a burnt sacrifice for a soothing aroma, [and] an offering made by fire unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Leviticus,8,22,"And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aharon [Bright, Very High] and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram."
Leviticus,8,23,"And he killed [it] ; and Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] took of the blood of it, and put [it] upon the tip of Aharon [Bright, Very High] ’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot."
Leviticus,8,24,"And he brought Aharon [Bright, Very High] ’s sons, and Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about."
Leviticus,8,25,"And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that [was] upon the inwards, and the caul (membrane; fatty tissue around a bodily organ) [above] the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:"
Leviticus,8,26,"And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that [was] before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put [them] on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:"
Leviticus,8,27,"And he put all upon Aharon [Bright, Very High] ’s hands, and upon his sons’ hands, and waved them [for] a wave offering before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Leviticus,8,28,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] took them from off their hands, and burnt [them] on the altar upon the burnt offering: they [were] consecrations for a soothing aroma: it [is] an offering made by fire unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Leviticus,8,29,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] took the breast, and waved it [for] a wave offering before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate): [for] of the ram of consecration it was Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] ’ part; as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Leviticus,8,30,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which [was] upon the altar, and sprinkled [it] upon Aharon [Bright, Very High], [and] upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with him; and sanctified Aharon [Bright, Very High], [and] his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him."
Leviticus,8,31,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto Aharon [Bright, Very High] and to his sons, Boil the flesh [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that [is] in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aharon [Bright, Very High] and his sons shall eat it."
Leviticus,8,32,And that which remains of the flesh and of the bread shall you 2f burn with fire.
Leviticus,8,33,"And you 2f shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation [in] seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate (treat as set apart or separate unto God) you."
Leviticus,8,34,"As he has done this day, [so] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has commanded to do, to make an atonement for you."
Leviticus,8,35,"Therefore shall you 2f abide [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that you 2f die not: for so I am commanded."
Leviticus,8,36,"So Aharon [Bright, Very High] and his sons did all things which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded by the hand of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Leviticus,9,1,"And it came to pass on the eighth day, [that] Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] called Aharon [Bright, Very High] and his sons, and the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God];"
Leviticus,9,2,"And he said unto Aharon [Bright, Very High] , Take you i a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer [them] before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Leviticus,9,3,"And unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] you i shall speak, saying, Take you 2f a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, [both] of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;"
Leviticus,9,4,"Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for today the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will appear unto you."
Leviticus,9,5,And they brought [that] which Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
Leviticus,9,6,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said, This [is] the thing which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded that you 2f should do: and the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall appear unto you."
Leviticus,9,7,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto Aharon [Bright, Very High] , Go unto the altar, and offer you i sin offering, and you i burnt offering, and make an atonement for yourself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded."
Leviticus,9,8,"Aharon [Bright, Very High] therefore went unto the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which [was] for himself."
Leviticus,9,9,"And the sons of Aharon [Bright, Very High] brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put [it] upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:"
Leviticus,9,10,"But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul (membrane; fatty tissue around a bodily organ) above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Leviticus,9,11,And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
Leviticus,9,12,"And he killed the burnt offering; and Aharon [Bright, Very High] ’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar."
Leviticus,9,13,"And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt [them] upon the altar."
Leviticus,9,14,"And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt [them] upon the burnt offering on the altar."
Leviticus,9,15,"And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which [was] the sin offering for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, as the first."
Leviticus,9,16,"And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner."
Leviticus,9,17,"And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt [it] upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning."
Leviticus,9,18,"He killed also the bullock and the ram [for] a sacrifice of peace offerings, which [was] for the people: and Aharon [Bright, Very High] ’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,"
Leviticus,9,19,"And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covers [the inwards] , and the kidneys, and the caul (membrane; fatty tissue around a bodily organ) [above] the liver:"
Leviticus,9,20,"And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:"
Leviticus,9,21,"And the breasts and the right shoulder Aharon [Bright, Very High] waved [for] a wave offering before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; as Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] commanded."
Leviticus,9,22,"And Aharon [Bright, Very High] lifted up his hand toward the people, and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings."
Leviticus,9,23,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and Aharon [Bright, Very High] went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) the people: and the glory of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) appeared unto all the people."
Leviticus,9,24,"And there came a fire out from before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: [which] when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces."
Leviticus,10,1,"And Nadav [Generous] and Avihu [he is my father] , the sons of Aharon [Bright, Very High] , took either of them his censer, and put fire in it, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he commanded them not."
Leviticus,10,2,"And there went out fire from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and devoured them, and they died before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Leviticus,10,3,"Then Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto Aharon [Bright, Very High] , This [is it] that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aharon [Bright, Very High] held his peace."
Leviticus,10,4,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] called Misha’el [Who is what God is] and Elzafan [God Protects] , the sons of Uzziel [My Strength is God] the uncle of Aharon [Bright, Very High] , and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp."
Leviticus,10,5,"So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] had said."
Leviticus,10,6,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said unto Aharon [Bright, Very High] , and unto El’azar [God has helped] and unto Itamar [Coast of Palms] , his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend (tear apart; forcefully rip apart) your clothes; lest you 2f die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , bewail the burning which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has kindled."
Leviticus,10,7,"And you 2f shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest you 2f die: for the anointing oil of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] upon you. And they did according to the word of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Leviticus,10,8,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Aharon [Bright, Very High] , saying,"
Leviticus,10,9,"Do not drink wine nor strong drink, you i , nor you i sons with you i , when you 2f go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest you 2f die: [it shall be] a statute forever throughout your generations:"
Leviticus,10,10,"And that you 2f may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;"
Leviticus,10,11,And that you 2f may teach the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] all the statutes which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has spoken unto them by the hand of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters].
Leviticus,10,12,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] spoke unto Aharon [Bright, Very High] , and unto El’azar [God has helped] and unto Itamar [Coast of Palms] , his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remains of the offerings of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it [is] most holy:"
Leviticus,10,13,"And you 2f shall eat it in the holy place, because it [is] you i due, and you i sons’ due, of the sacrifices of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) made by fire: for so I am commanded."
Leviticus,10,14,"And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall you 2f eat in a clean place; you i , and you i sons, and you i daughters with you i : for [they be] you i due, and you i sons’ due, [which] are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Leviticus,10,15,"The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave [it for] a wave offering before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and it shall be you i , and you i sons’ with you i , by a statute forever; as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has commanded."
Leviticus,10,16,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with El’azar [God has helped] and Itamar [Coast of Palms] , the sons of Aharon [Bright, Very High] [which were] left [alive] , saying,"
Leviticus,10,17,"For what reason have you 2f not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it [is] most holy, and [God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]] has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)?"
Leviticus,10,18,"Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy [place] : you 2f should indeed have eaten it in the holy [place] , as I commanded."
Leviticus,10,19,"And Aharon [Bright, Very High] said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and such things have befallen me: and [if] I had eaten the sin offering today, should it have been accepted in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)?"
Leviticus,10,20,"And when Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] heard [that] , he was content."
Leviticus,11,1,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and to Aharon [Bright, Very High] , saying unto them,"
Leviticus,11,2,"Speak unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, These [are] the beasts which you 2f shall eat among all the beasts that [are] on the earth."
Leviticus,11,3,"Whatsoever parts the hoof, and is cloven (separated; split; divided up) -footed, [and] chews the cud, among the beasts, that shall you 2f eat."
Leviticus,11,4,"Nevertheless these shall you 2f not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: [as] the camel, because he chews the cud, but divides not the hoof; he [is] unclean unto you."
Leviticus,11,5,"And the Coney, because he chews the cud, but divides not the hoof; he [is] unclean unto you."
Leviticus,11,6,"And the hare, because he chews the cud, but divides not the hoof; he [is] unclean unto you."
Leviticus,11,7,"And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be cloven (separated; split; divided up)-footed, yet he chews not the cud; he [is] unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,8,"Of their flesh shall you 2f not eat, and their carcass shall you 2f not touch; they [are] unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,9,"These shall you 2f eat of all that [are] in the waters: whatsoever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall you 2f eat."
Leviticus,11,10,"And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which [is] in the waters, they [shall be] an abomination unto you:"
Leviticus,11,11,"They shall be even an abomination unto you; you 2f shall not eat of their flesh, but you 2f shall have their carcasses in abomination."
Leviticus,11,12,"Whatsoever has no fins nor scales in the waters, that [shall be] an abomination unto you."
Leviticus,11,13,"And these [are they which] you 2f shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they [are] an abomination: the eagle, and the vultures, and the osprey,"
Leviticus,11,14,"And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;"
Leviticus,11,15,Every raven after his kind;
Leviticus,11,16,"And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after his kind,"
Leviticus,11,17,"And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,"
Leviticus,11,18,"And the swan, and the pelican, and the barn owl,"
Leviticus,11,19,"And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat."
Leviticus,11,20,"All fowls that creep, going upon [all] four, [shall be] an abomination unto you."
Leviticus,11,21,"Yet these may you 2f eat of every flying creeping thing that goes upon [all] four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;"
Leviticus,11,22," [Even] these of them you 2f may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind."
Leviticus,11,23,"But all [other] flying creeping things, which have four feet, [shall be] an abomination unto you."
Leviticus,11,24,And for these you 2f shall be unclean: whosoever touches the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus,11,25,"And whosoever bears [ought] of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,11,26," [The carcasses] of every beast which divides the hoof, and [is] not cloven (separated; split; divided up)-footed, nor chews the cud, [are] unclean unto you: every one that touches them shall be unclean."
Leviticus,11,27,"And whatsoever goes upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on [all] four, those [are] unclean unto you: whoso touches their carcass shall be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,11,28,"And he that bears the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: they [are] unclean unto you."
Leviticus,11,29,"These also [shall be] unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,"
Leviticus,11,30,"And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole."
Leviticus,11,31,"These [are] unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever does touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,11,32,"And upon whatsoever [any] of them, when they are dead, does fall, it shall be unclean; whether [it be] any vessel of wood, or clothing, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel [it be] , wherein [any] work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed."
Leviticus,11,33,"And every earthen vessel, whereinto [any] of them falls, whatsoever [is] in it shall be unclean; and you 2f shall break it."
Leviticus,11,34,"Of all meat which may be eaten, [that] on which [such] water comes shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every [such] vessel shall be unclean."
Leviticus,11,35,"And every [thing] whereupon [any part] of their carcass falls shall be unclean; [whether it be] oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: [for] they [are] unclean, and shall be unclean unto you."
Leviticus,11,36,"Nevertheless a fountain or pit, [wherein there is] plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which touches their carcass shall be unclean."
Leviticus,11,37,"And if [any part] of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it [shall be] clean."
Leviticus,11,38,"But if [any] water be put upon the seed, and [any part] of their carcass fall thereon, it [shall be] unclean unto you."
Leviticus,11,39,"And if any beast, of which you 2f may eat, die; he that touches the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,11,40,"And he that eats of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: he also that bears the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,11,41,And every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth [shall be] an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus,11,42,"Whatsoever goes upon the belly, and whatsoever goes upon [all] four, or whatsoever has more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them you 2f shall not eat; for they [are] an abomination."
Leviticus,11,43,"You 2f shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creeps, neither shall you 2f make yourselves unclean with them, that you 2f should be defiled thereby."
Leviticus,11,44,"For I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : you 2f shall therefore sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) yourselves, and you 2f shall be holy; for I [am] holy: neither shall you 2f defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creeps upon the earth."
Leviticus,11,45,"For I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) that brings you up out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , to be your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : you 2f shall therefore be holy, for I [am] holy."
Leviticus,11,46,"This [is] the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that creeps upon the earth:"
Leviticus,11,47,"To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten."
Leviticus,12,1,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying,"
Leviticus,12,2,"Speak unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean."
Leviticus,12,3,And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
Leviticus,12,4,"And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall to (to do entirely, do wholly) uch no consecrated thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled."
Leviticus,12,5,"But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days."
Leviticus,12,6,"And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:"
Leviticus,12,7,"Who shall offer it before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue (what comes forth) of her blood. This [is] the law for her that has born a male or a female."
Leviticus,12,8,"And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean."
Leviticus,13,1,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and Aharon [Bright, Very High] , saying,"
Leviticus,13,2,"When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh [like] the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aharon [Bright, Very High] the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:"
Leviticus,13,3,"And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and [when] the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight [be] deeper than the skin of his flesh, it [is] a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean."
Leviticus,13,4,"If the bright spot [be] white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight [be] not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up [him that has] the plague seven days:"
Leviticus,13,5,"And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, [if] the plague in his sight be at a stay, [and] the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:"
Leviticus,13,6,"And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, [if] the plague [be] somewhat dark, [and] the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it [is but] a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean."
Leviticus,13,7,"But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he has been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again:"
Leviticus,13,8,"And [if] the priest see that, behold, the scab spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] a leprosy."
Leviticus,13,9,"When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;"
Leviticus,13,10,"And the priest shall see [him] : and, behold, [if] the rising [be] white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and [there be] quick raw flesh in the rising;"
Leviticus,13,11,"It [is] an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he [is] unclean."
Leviticus,13,12,"And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of [him that has] the plague from his head even to his foot, wherever the priest looks;"
Leviticus,13,13,"Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, [if] the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce [him] clean [that has] the plague: it is all turned white: he [is] clean."
Leviticus,13,14,"But when raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean."
Leviticus,13,15,"And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: [for] the raw flesh [is] unclean: it [is] a leprosy."
Leviticus,13,16,"Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;"
Leviticus,13,17,"And the priest shall see him: and, behold, [if] the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce [him] clean [that has] the plague: he [is] clean."
Leviticus,13,18,"The flesh also, in which, [even] in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,"
Leviticus,13,19,"And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be showed to the priest;"
Leviticus,13,20,"And if, when the priest sees it, behold, it [be] in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil."
Leviticus,13,21,"But if the priest look on it, and, behold, [there be] no white hairs in it, and [if] it [be] not lower than the skin, but [be] somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:"
Leviticus,13,22,"And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] a plague."
Leviticus,13,23,"But if the bright spot stay in his place, [and] spread not, it [is] a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean."
Leviticus,13,24,"Or if there be [any] flesh, in the skin whereof [there is] a hot burning, and the quick [flesh] that burns have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;"
Leviticus,13,25,"Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, [if] the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it [be in] sight deeper than the skin; it [is] a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] the plague of leprosy."
Leviticus,13,26,"But if the priest look on it, and, behold, [there be] no white hair in the bright spot, and it [be] no lower than the [other] skin, but [be] somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:"
Leviticus,13,27,"And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: [and] if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] the plague of leprosy."
Leviticus,13,28,"And if the bright spot stay in his place, [and] spread not in the skin, but it [be] somewhat dark; it [is] a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it [is] an inflammation of the burning."
Leviticus,13,29,If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;
Leviticus,13,30,"Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it [be] in sight deeper than the skin; [and there be] in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] a dry scale, [even] a leprosy upon the head or beard."
Leviticus,13,31,"And if the priest look on the plague of the scale, and, behold, it [be] not in sight deeper than the skin, and [that there is] no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up [him that has] the plague of the scale seven days:"
Leviticus,13,32,"And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, [if] the scale spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scale [be] not in sight deeper than the skin;"
Leviticus,13,33,"He shall be shaven, but the scale shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up [him that has] the scale seven days more:"
Leviticus,13,34,"And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scale: and, behold, [if] the scale be not spread in the skin, nor [be] in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean."
Leviticus,13,35,But if the scale spread much in the skin after his cleansing;
Leviticus,13,36,"Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scale be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he [is] unclean."
Leviticus,13,37,"But if the scale be in his sight at a stay, and [that] there is black hair grown up in it; the scale is healed, he [is] clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean."
Leviticus,13,38,"If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, [even] white bright spots;"
Leviticus,13,39,"Then the priest shall look: and, behold, [if] the bright spots in the skin of their flesh [be] darkish white; it [is] a freckled spot [that] grows in the skin; he [is] clean."
Leviticus,13,40,"And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he [is] bald; [yet is] he clean."
Leviticus,13,41,"And he that has his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he [is] forehead bald: [yet is] he clean."
Leviticus,13,42,"And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it [is] a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead."
Leviticus,13,43,"Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, [if] the rising of the sore [be] white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appears in the skin of the flesh;"
Leviticus,13,44,"He is a leprous man, he [is] unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague [is] in his head."
Leviticus,13,45,"And the leper in whom the plague [is] , his clothes shall be rent, and his head bore, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean."
Leviticus,13,46,All the days wherein the plague [shall be] in him he shall be defiled; he [is] unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp [shall] his habitation [be].
Leviticus,13,47,"The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, [whether it be] a woolen garment, or a linen garment;"
Leviticus,13,48,"Whether [it be] in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woolen; whether in a skin, or in anything made of skin;"
Leviticus,13,49,"And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; it [is] a plague of leprosy, and shall be showed unto the priest:"
Leviticus,13,50,"And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up [it that has] the plague seven days:"
Leviticus,13,51,"And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, [or] in any work that is made of skin; the plague [is] a fretting (eating away; wearing away) leprosy; it [is] unclean."
Leviticus,13,52,"He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woolen or in linen, or anything of skin, wherein the plague is: for it [is] a fretting (eating away; wearing away) leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire."
Leviticus,13,53,"And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin;"
Leviticus,13,54,"Then the priest shall command that they wash [the thing] wherein the plague [is] , and he shall shut it up seven days more:"
Leviticus,13,55,"And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, [if] the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it [is] unclean; you i shall burn it in the fire; it [is] be troubled (be grieved; be displeased) inward, [whether] it [be] bore within or without."
Leviticus,13,56,"And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague [be] somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend (tear apart; forcefully rip apart) it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:"
Leviticus,13,57,"And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; it [is] a spreading [plague] : you i shall burn that wherein the plague [is] with fire."
Leviticus,13,58,"And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin [it be] , which you i shall wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean."
Leviticus,13,59,"This [is] the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woolen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or anything of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean."
Leviticus,14,1,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying,"
Leviticus,14,2,This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:
Leviticus,14,3,"And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, [if] the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper;"
Leviticus,14,4,"Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive [and] clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:"
Leviticus,14,5,And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water:
Leviticus,14,6,"As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird [that was] killed over the running water:"
Leviticus,14,7,"And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field."
Leviticus,14,8,"And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall wait abroad out of his tent seven days."
Leviticus,14,9,"But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean."
Leviticus,14,10,"And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour [for] a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil."
Leviticus,14,11,"And the priest that makes [him] clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:"
Leviticus,14,12,"And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them [for] a wave offering before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):"
Leviticus,14,13,"And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering [is] the priest’s, [so is] the trespass offering: it [is] most holy:"
Leviticus,14,14,"And the priest shall take [some] of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put [it] upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:"
Leviticus,14,15,"And the priest shall take [some] of the log of oil, and pour [it] into the palm of his own left hand:"
Leviticus,14,16,"And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that [is] in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):"
Leviticus,14,17,"And of the rest of the oil that [is] in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering:"
Leviticus,14,18,And the remnant of the oil that [is] in the priest’s hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
Leviticus,14,19,"And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:"
Leviticus,14,20,"And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean."
Leviticus,14,21,"And if he [be] poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb [for] a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;"
Leviticus,14,22,"And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering."
Leviticus,14,23,"And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Leviticus,14,24,"And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them [for] a wave offering before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):"
Leviticus,14,25,"And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take [some] of the blood of the trespass offering, and put [it] upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:"
Leviticus,14,26,And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand:
Leviticus,14,27,And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger [some] of the oil that [is] in his left hand seven times before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):
Leviticus,14,28,"And the priest shall put of the oil that [is] in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering:"
Leviticus,14,29,"And the rest of the oil that [is] in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Leviticus,14,30,"And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he can get;"
Leviticus,14,31," [Even] such as he is able to get, the one [for] a sin offering, and the other [for] a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Leviticus,14,32,"This [is] the law [of him] in whom [is] the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get [that which pertains] to his cleansing."
Leviticus,14,33,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and unto Aharon [Bright, Very High] , saying,"
Leviticus,14,34,"When you 2f be come into the land of Kena’an [Merchant] , which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;"
Leviticus,14,35,"And he that owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seem to me [there is] as it were a plague in the house:"
Leviticus,14,36,"Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go [into it] to see the plague, that all that [is] in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:"
Leviticus,14,37,"And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, [if] the plague [be] in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight [are] lower than the wall;"
Leviticus,14,38,"Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:"
Leviticus,14,39,"And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, [if] the plague be spread in the walls of the house;"
Leviticus,14,40,"Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague [is] , and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:"
Leviticus,14,41,"And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:"
Leviticus,14,42,"And they shall take other stones, and put [them] in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house."
Leviticus,14,43,"And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he has taken away the stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it is plastered;"
Leviticus,14,44,"Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, [if] the plague be spread in the house, it [is] a fretting (eating away; wearing away) leprosy in the house: it [is] unclean."
Leviticus,14,45,"And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry [them] forth out of the city into an unclean place."
Leviticus,14,46,Moreover he that goes into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus,14,47,And he that lies in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
Leviticus,14,48,"And if the priest shall come in, and look [upon it] , and, behold, the plague has not spread in the house, after the house was plastered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed."
Leviticus,14,49,"And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:"
Leviticus,14,50,And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:
Leviticus,14,51,"And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:"
Leviticus,14,52,"And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:"
Leviticus,14,53,"But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean."
Leviticus,14,54,"This [is] the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scale,"
Leviticus,14,55,"And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,"
Leviticus,14,56,"And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:"
Leviticus,14,57,"To teach when [it is] unclean, and when [it is] clean: this [is] the law of leprosy."
Leviticus,15,1,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and to Aharon [Bright, Very High] , saying,"
Leviticus,15,2,"Speak unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and say unto them, When any man has a running issue (what comes forth) out of his flesh, [because of] his issue (what comes forth) he [is] unclean."
Leviticus,15,3,"And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue (what comes forth) : whether his flesh run with his issue (what comes forth) , or his flesh be stopped from his issue (what comes forth) , it [is] his uncleanness."
Leviticus,15,4,"Every bed, whereon he lies that has the issue (what comes forth) , is unclean: and everything, whereon he sits, shall be unclean."
Leviticus,15,5,"And whosoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,15,6,"And he that sits on [any] thing whereon he sat that has the issue (what comes forth) shall wash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,15,7,"And he that touches the flesh of him that has the issue (what comes forth) shall wash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,15,8,"And if he that has the issue (what comes forth) spit upon him that is clean; then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,15,9,And what saddle soever he rides upon that has the issue (what comes forth) shall be unclean.
Leviticus,15,10,"And whosoever touches anything that was under him shall be unclean until the evening: and he that bears [any of] those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,15,11,"And whomsoever he touches that has the issue (what comes forth) , and has not rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean until the even."
Leviticus,15,12,"And the vessel of earth, that he touches which has the issue (what comes forth) , shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water."
Leviticus,15,13,"And when he that has an issue (what comes forth) is cleansed of his issue (what comes forth) ; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean."

Leviticus,24,9,"And it shall be Aharon [Bright, Very High] ’s and his sons’; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it [is] most holy unto him of the offerings of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) made by fire by a perpetual statute."
Leviticus,24,10,"And the son of an Israeli woman, whose father [was] an Mitzri [Egyptian] , went out among the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and this son of the Israeli [woman] and a man of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] strove together in the camp;"
Leviticus,24,11,"And the Israeli woman’s son blasphemed the name [of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)] , and cursed. And they brought him unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] (and his mother’s name [was] Shlomit [Peaceful], the daughter of Dibri [My Word], of the tribe of Dan [Judge])"
Leviticus,24,12,"And they put him in ward (in custody, with a guard; prison), that the mind of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) might be showed them."
Leviticus,24,13,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying,"
Leviticus,24,14,"Bring forth him that has cursed without the camp; and let all that heard [him] lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him."
Leviticus,24,15,"And you i shall speak unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, Whosoever curses his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shall bear his sin."
Leviticus,24,16,"And he that blasphemes the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , he shall surely be put to death, [and] all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemes the name [of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)], shall be put to death."
Leviticus,24,17,And he that kills any man shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus,24,18,And he that kills a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.
Leviticus,24,19,"And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he has done, so shall it be done to him;"
Leviticus,24,20,"Breach (breaking forth; a break; opening, inlet) for breach (breaking forth; a break; opening, inlet), eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he has caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him [again]."
Leviticus,24,21,"And he that kills a beast, he shall restore it: and he that kills a man, he shall be put to death."
Leviticus,24,22,"You 2f shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Leviticus,24,23,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] spoke to the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Leviticus,25,1,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] in mount Sinai, saying,"
Leviticus,25,2,"Speak unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and say unto them, When you 2f come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a Shabbat [Rest] unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Leviticus,25,3,"Six years you i shall sow you i field, and six years you i shall prune you i vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;"
Leviticus,25,4,"But in the seventh year shall be a Shabbat [Rest] of rest unto the land, a Shabbat [Rest] for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : you i shall neither sow you i field, nor prune you i vineyard."
Leviticus,25,5,"That which grows of its own accord of you i harvest you i shall not reap, neither gather the grapes of you i vine undressed: [for] it is a year of rest unto the land."
Leviticus,25,6,"And the Shabbat [Rest] of the land shall be meat for you; for you i , and for you i servant, and for you i maid, and for you i hired servant, and for you i stranger that sojourns with you i,"
Leviticus,25,7,"And for you i cattle, and for the beast that [are] in you i land, shall all the increase thereof be meat."
Leviticus,25,8,"And you i shall number seven Shabbat of years unto you i , seven times seven years; and the space of the seven Shabbat of years shall be unto you i forty and nine years."
Leviticus,25,9,"Then shall you i cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth [day] of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall you 2f make the trumpet sound throughout all your land."
Leviticus,25,10,"And you 2f shall hallow (to approve, commend, accept) the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout [all] the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and you 2f shall return every man unto his possession, and you 2f shall return every man unto his family."
Leviticus,25,11,"A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you: you 2f shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself in it, nor gather [the grapes] in it of you i vine undressed."
Leviticus,25,12,For it [is] the jubilee; it shall be holy unto you: you 2f shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
Leviticus,25,13,In the year of this jubilee you 2f shall return every man unto his possession.
Leviticus,25,14,"And if you i sell ought unto you i neighbour, or buys [ought] of you i neighbour’s hand, you 2f shall not oppress one another:"
Leviticus,25,15,"According to the number of years after the jubilee you i shall buy of you i neighbour, [and] according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto you i:"
Leviticus,25,16,"According to the multitude of years you i shall increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years you i shall diminish the price of it: for [according] to the number [of the years] of the fruits does he sell unto you i."
Leviticus,25,17,You 2f shall not therefore oppress one another; but you i shall fear you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : for I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered].
Leviticus,25,18,"For what reason you 2f shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and you 2f shall dwell in the land in safety."
Leviticus,25,19,"And the land shall yield her fruit, and you 2f shall eat your fill, and dwell in it in safety."
Leviticus,25,20,"And if you 2f shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:"
Leviticus,25,21,"Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years."
Leviticus,25,22,"And you 2f shall sow the eighth year, and eat [yet] of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in you 2f shall eat [of] the old [store]."
Leviticus,25,23,The land shall not be sold forever: for the land [is] my; for you 2f [are] strangers and sojourners with me.
Leviticus,25,24,And in all the land of your possession you 2f shall grant a redemption for the land.
Leviticus,25,25,"If you i brother be waxen poor, and has sold away [some] of his possession, and if any of his family come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold."
Leviticus,25,26,"And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;"
Leviticus,25,27,"Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession."
Leviticus,25,28,"But if he be not able to restore [it] to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that has bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession."
Leviticus,25,29,"And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; [within] a full year may he redeem it."
Leviticus,25,30,"And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that [is] in the walled city shall be established forever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee."
Leviticus,25,31,"But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee."
Leviticus,25,32,"Yet the cities of the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to], [and] the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] redeem at any time."
Leviticus,25,33,"And if a man purchase of the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in [the year of] jubilee: for the houses of the cities of the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] [are] their possession among the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Leviticus,25,34,But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it [is] their perpetual possession.
Leviticus,25,35,"And if you i brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with you i ; then you i shall relieve him: [yes, though he be] a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with you i."
Leviticus,25,36,"Take you i no usury (interest paid for using money) of him, or increase: but fear you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; that you i brother may live with you i."
Leviticus,25,37,"you i shall not give him you i money upon usury (interest paid for using money) , nor lend him you i victuals (food for humans) for increase."
Leviticus,25,38,"I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which brought you forth out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , to give you the land of Kena’an [Merchant], [and] to be your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Leviticus,25,39,"And if you i brother [that dwells] by you i be waxen poor, and be sold unto you i ; you i shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:"
Leviticus,25,40," [But] as an hired servant, [and] as a sojourner, he shall be with you i, [and] shall serve you i unto the year of jubilee:"
Leviticus,25,41,"And [then] shall he depart from you i, [both] he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return."
Leviticus,25,42,"For they [are] my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : they shall not be sold as bondmen."
Leviticus,25,43,you i shall not rule over him with rigour; but shall fear you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered].
Leviticus,25,44,"Both you i bondmen, and you i bondmaids, which you i shall have, [shall be] of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall you 2f buy bondmen and bondmaids."
Leviticus,25,45,"Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall you 2f buy, and of their families that [are] with you, which they begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) in your land: and they shall be your possession."
Leviticus,25,46,"And you 2f shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit [them for] a possession; they shall be your bondmen forever: but over your brethren the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , you 2f shall not rule one over another with rigour."
Leviticus,25,47,"And if a sojourner or stranger grow (become; advance) rich by you i , and you i brother [that dwells] by him grow (become; advance) poor, and sell himself unto the stranger [or] sojourner by you i , or to the stock of the stranger’s family:"
Leviticus,25,48,After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:
Leviticus,25,49,"Either his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or [any] that is near of family unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself."
Leviticus,25,50,"And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him."
Leviticus,25,51,"If [there be] yet many years [behind] , according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for."
Leviticus,25,52,"And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, [and] according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption."
Leviticus,25,53, [And] as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: [and the other] shall not rule with rigour over him in you i sight.
Leviticus,25,54,"And if he be not redeemed in these [years] , then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, [both] he, and his children with him."
Leviticus,25,55,For unto me the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [are] servants; they [are] my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered].
Leviticus,26,1,"You 2f shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall you 2f set up [any] image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Leviticus,26,2,"You 2f shall keep my Shabbat, and reverence my sanctuary: I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Leviticus,26,3,"If you 2f walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;"
Leviticus,26,4,"Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit."
Leviticus,26,5,"And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and you 2f shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely."
Leviticus,26,6,"And I will give peace in the land, and you 2f shall lie down, and none shall make [you] afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land."
Leviticus,26,7,"And you 2f shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword."
Leviticus,26,8,"And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword."
Leviticus,26,9,"For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you."
Leviticus,26,10,"And you 2f shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new."
Leviticus,26,11,And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
Leviticus,26,12,"And I will walk among you, and will be your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and you 2f shall be my people."
Leviticus,26,13,"I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which brought you forth out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , that you 2f should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright."
Leviticus,26,14,"But if you 2f will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;"
Leviticus,26,15,"And if you 2f shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that you 2f will not do all my commandments, [but] that you 2f break my covenant:"
Leviticus,26,16,"I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption (diseae that eats the body; destruction) , and the burning ague (a fever) , that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and you 2f shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it."
Leviticus,26,17,"And I will set my face against you, and you 2f shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and you 2f shall flee when none pursues you."
Leviticus,26,18,"And if you 2f will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins."
Leviticus,26,19,"And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:"
Leviticus,26,20,"And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits."
Leviticus,26,21,"And if you 2f walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins."
Leviticus,26,22,"I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your [high] ways shall be desolate."
Leviticus,26,23,"And if you 2f will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;"
Leviticus,26,24,"Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins."
Leviticus,26,25,"And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of [my] covenant: and when you 2f are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and you 2f shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy."
Leviticus,26,26," [And] when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver [you] your bread again by weight: and you 2f shall eat, and not be satisfied."
Leviticus,26,27,"And if you 2f will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;"
Leviticus,26,28,"Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins."
Leviticus,26,29,"And you 2f shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall you 2f eat."
Leviticus,26,30,"And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you."
Leviticus,26,31,"And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours."
Leviticus,26,32,And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell in it shall be astonished at it.
Leviticus,26,33,"And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste."
Leviticus,26,34,"Then shall the land enjoy her Shabbat, as long as it lies desolate, and you 2f [be] in your enemies’ land; [even] then shall the land rest, and enjoy her Shabbat."
Leviticus,26,35,"As long as it lies desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your Shabbat, when you 2f dwelt upon it."
Leviticus,26,36,"And upon them that are left [alive] of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursues."
Leviticus,26,37,"And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursues: and you 2f shall have no power to stand before your enemies."
Leviticus,26,38,"And you 2f shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up."
Leviticus,26,39,And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
Leviticus,26,40,"If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;"
Leviticus,26,41,"And [that] I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:"
Leviticus,26,42,"Then will I remember my covenant with Ya’akov [Heal of God] , and also my covenant with Yitz’khak [Laughter] , and also my covenant with Avraham [Exalted Father] will I remember; and I will remember the land."
Leviticus,26,43,"The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her Shabbat, while she lies desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes."
Leviticus,26,44,"And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Leviticus,26,45,"But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : I [am] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Leviticus,26,46,"These [are] the statutes and judgments and laws, which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) made between him and the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in mount Sinai by the hand of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Leviticus,27,1,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , saying,"
Leviticus,27,2,"Speak unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons [shall be] for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) by you i estimation."
Leviticus,27,3,"And you i estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even you i estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary."
Leviticus,27,4,"And if it [be] a female, then you i estimation shall be thirty shekels."
Leviticus,27,5,"And if [it be] from five years old even unto twenty years old, then you i estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels."
Leviticus,27,6,"And if [it be] from a month old even unto five years old, then you i estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female you i estimation [shall be] three shekels of silver."
Leviticus,27,7,"And if [it be] from sixty years old and above; if [it be] a male, then you i estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels."
Leviticus,27,8,"But if he be poorer than you i estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him."
Leviticus,27,9,"And if [it be] a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , all that [any man] gives of such unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall be holy."
Leviticus,27,10,"He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy."
Leviticus,27,11,"And if [it be] any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , then he shall present the beast before the priest:"
Leviticus,27,12,"And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as you i values it, [who are] the priest, so shall it be."
Leviticus,27,13,"But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth [part] thereof unto you i estimation."
Leviticus,27,14,"And when a man shall sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) his house [to be] holy unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand."
Leviticus,27,15,"And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth [part] of the money of you i estimation unto it, and it shall be his."
Leviticus,27,16,"And if a man shall sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [some part] of a field of his possession, then you i estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed [shall be valued] at fifty shekels of silver."
Leviticus,27,17,"If he sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) his field from the year of jubilee, according to you i estimation it shall stand."
Leviticus,27,18,"But if he sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from you i estimation."
Leviticus,27,19,"And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth [part] of the money of you i estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him."
Leviticus,27,20,"And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more."
Leviticus,27,21,"But the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s."
Leviticus,27,22,"And if [a man] sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) a field which he has bought, which [is] not of the fields of his possession;"
Leviticus,27,23,"Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of you i estimation, [even] unto the year of the jubilee: and he shall give you i estimation in that day, [as] a holy thing unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Leviticus,27,24,"In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, [even] to him to whom the possession of the land [did belong]."
Leviticus,27,25,And all you i estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
Leviticus,27,26,"Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] firstling, no man shall sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) it; whether [it be] ox, or sheep: it [is] the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate]."
Leviticus,27,27,"And if [it be] of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem [it] according to you i estimation, and shall add a fifth [part] of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to you i estimation."
Leviticus,27,28,"Yet no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) of all that he has, [both] of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing [is] most holy unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Leviticus,27,29,"None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; [but] shall surely be put to death."
Leviticus,27,30,"And all the tithe of the land, [whether] of the seed of the land, [or] of the fruit of the tree, [is] the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate]: [it is] holy unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Leviticus,27,31,"And if a man will at all redeem [ought] of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth [part] thereof."
