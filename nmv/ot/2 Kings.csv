2 Kings,1,1,Then Mo’av [Seed of my Father] rebelled against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] after the death of Ach’av [father’s brother].
2 Kings,1,2,"And Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that [was] in Shomron [watch mountain] , and was injured: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Ba’al-Z’vuv [lord of the flies] the god of ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots] whether I shall recover of this disease."
2 Kings,1,3,"But the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said to Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] the Tishbi [captivity] , Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Shomron [watch mountain] , and say unto them, [Is it] not because [there is] not a God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [that] you 2f go to enquire of Ba’al-Z’vuv [lord of the flies] the god of ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots]?"
2 Kings,1,4,"Now therefore thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , you i shall not come down from that bed on which you i are gone up, but shall surely die. And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] departed."
2 Kings,1,5,"And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are you 2f now turned back?"
2 Kings,1,6,"And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [Is it] not because [there is] not a God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [that] you i send to enquire of Ba’al-Z’vuv [lord of the flies] the god of ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots] ? therefore you i shall not come down from that bed on which you i are gone up, but shall surely die."
2 Kings,1,7,"And he said unto them, What manner of man [was he] which came up to meet you, and told you these words?"
2 Kings,1,8,"And they answered him, [He was] an hairy man, and wearing with a belt of leather about his waist. And he said, It [is] Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] the Tishbi [captivity]."
2 Kings,1,9,"Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spoke unto him, you i man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , the king has said, Come down."
2 Kings,1,10,"And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I [be] a man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , then let fire come down from heaven, and consume you i and your i fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty."
2 Kings,1,11,"Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , thus has the king said, Come down quickly."
2 Kings,1,12,"And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] answered and said unto them, If I [be] a man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , let fire come down from heaven, and consume you i and your i fifty. And the fire of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty."
2 Kings,1,13,"And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] , and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , I pray you i , let my life, and the life of these fifty your i servants, be precious in your i sight."
2 Kings,1,14,"Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in your i sight."
2 Kings,1,15,"And the angel (messenger) of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] , Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king."
2 Kings,1,16,"And he said unto him, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Forasmuch as you i have sent messengers to enquire of Ba’al-Z’vuv [lord of the flies] the god of ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots], [is it] not because [there is] no God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to enquire of his word? therefore you i shall not come down off that bed on which you i are gone up, but shall surely die."
2 Kings,1,17,So he died according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) which Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] had spoken. And Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] reigned in his stead in the second year of Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] the son of Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ; because he had no son.
2 Kings,1,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] which he did, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
2 Kings,2,1,"And it came to pass, when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) would take up Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] into heaven by a whirlwind, that Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] went with Eli-sha [my God is salvation] from Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling]."
2 Kings,2,2,"And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] said unto Eli-sha [my God is salvation] , Tarry here, I pray you i ; for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has sent me to Beit-El [House of God] . And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] said [unto him, As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, and [as] your i soul lives, I will not leave you i . So they went down to Beit-El [House of God]."
2 Kings,2,3,"And the sons of the prophets that [were] at Beit-El [House of God] came forth to Eli-sha [my God is salvation] , and said unto him, Know you i that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will take away your i master from your i head to day? And he said, Yes, I know [it] ; hold you 2f your peace (say no more)."
2 Kings,2,4,"And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] said unto him, Eli-sha [my God is salvation] , wait here, I pray you i ; for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has sent me to Yericho [Its Moon] . And he said, [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, and [as] your i soul lives, I will not leave you i . So they came to Yericho [Its Moon]."
2 Kings,2,5,"And the sons of the prophets that [were] at Yericho [Its Moon] came to Eli-sha [my God is salvation] , and said unto him, Know you i that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will take away your i master from your i head to day? And he answered, Yes, I know [it] ; hold you 2f your peace."
2 Kings,2,6,"And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] said unto him, Tarry here I pray you i ; for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has sent me to Yarden [Descender] . And he said, [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, and [as] your i soul lives, I will not leave you i . And they two went on."
2 Kings,2,7,"And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Yarden [Descender]."
2 Kings,2,8,"And Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] took his Mantle (cloak; covering garment) (cloak) , and wrapped [it] together, and struck the waters, and they were divided to the right and left, so that they two went over on dry ground."
2 Kings,2,9,"And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] said unto Eli-sha [my God is salvation] , Ask what I shall do for you i , before I be taken away from you i . And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] said, I pray you i , let a double portion of your i spirit be upon me."
2 Kings,2,10,"And he said, you i have asked a hard thing: [nevertheless] , if you i see me [when I am] taken from you i , it shall be so unto you i ; but if not, it shall not be [so]."
2 Kings,2,11,"And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, [there appeared] a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and it separated them both; and Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] went up by a whirlwind into heaven."
2 Kings,2,12,"And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] saw [it] , and he cried, My father! my father! the chariot and the horsemen of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ! And he lost sight of him: and he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces."
2 Kings,2,13,"He took up also the Mantle (cloak; covering garment) (cloak) of Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Yarden [Descender];"
2 Kings,2,14,"And he took the Mantle (cloak; covering garment) (cloak) of Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, Where [is] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] ? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted to the right and to the left: and Eli-sha [my God is salvation] went over."
2 Kings,2,15,"And when the sons of the prophets which [were] to view at Yericho [Its Moon] saw him, they said, The spirit of Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] does rest on Eli-sha [my God is salvation] . And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him."
2 Kings,2,16,"And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with your i servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray you i , and seek your i master: in the event perhaps the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, You 2f shall not send."
2 Kings,2,17,"And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not."
2 Kings,2,18,"And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Yericho [Its Moon] ,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?"
2 Kings,2,19,"And the men of the city said unto Eli-sha [my God is salvation] , Behold, I pray you i , the situation of this city [is] pleasant, as my lord sees: but the water [is] bad, and the ground barren."
2 Kings,2,20,"And he said, Bring me a new jug, and put salt in it. And they brought [it] to him."
2 Kings,2,21,"And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , I have healed these waters; there shall not be from there any more death or barren [land]."
2 Kings,2,22,"So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Eli-sha [my God is salvation] which he spoke."
2 Kings,2,23,"And he went up from there unto Beit-El [House of God] : and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young men out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, you i bald head; go up, you i bald head."
2 Kings,2,24,"And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them."
2 Kings,2,25,"And he went from there to mount Carmel [Garden-land] , and from there he returned to Shomron [watch mountain]."
2 Kings,3,1,"Now Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] the son of Ach’av [father’s brother] began to reign over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in Shomron [watch mountain] the eighteenth year of Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and reigned twelve years."
2 Kings,3,2,"And he wrought evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] that his father had made."
2 Kings,3,3,"Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , which made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin; he departed not from them."
2 Kings,3,4,"And Mesha [deliverance] king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] was a sheep-breeder, and rendered unto the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool."
2 Kings,3,5,"But it came to pass, when Ach’av [father’s brother] was dead, that the king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] rebelled against the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,3,6,"And king Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] went out of Shomron [watch mountain] the same time, and numbered all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,3,7,"And he went and sent to Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] the king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , saying, The king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] has rebelled against me: will you i go with me against Mo’av [Seed of my Father] to battle? And he said, I will go up: I [am] as you i [are] , my people as your i people, [and] my horses as your i horses."
2 Kings,3,8,"And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom [Red]."
2 Kings,3,9,"So the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went, and the king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and the king of Edom [Red] : and they went on a circular course (go around, encircle; encompass) of seven days’ journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them."
2 Kings,3,10,"And the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said, Alas! that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Mo’av [Seed of my Father]!"
2 Kings,3,11,"But Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that we may enquire of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) by him? And one of the king of Yisra’el’s [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] servants answered and said, Here [is] Eli-sha [my God is salvation] the son of Shafat [He Has Judged] , which poured water on the hands of Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah]."
2 Kings,3,12,"And Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] said, The word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) is with him. So the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] and the king of Edom [Red] went down to him."
2 Kings,3,13,"And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] said unto the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , What have I to do with you i ? get you i to the prophets of your i father, and to the prophets of your i mother. And the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said unto him, No: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Mo’av [Seed of my Father]."
2 Kings,3,14,"And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] said, [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] the king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , I would not look toward you i , nor see you i."
2 Kings,3,15,"But now bring me a musician. And it came to pass, when the musician played, that the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came upon him."
2 Kings,3,16,"And he said, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Make this valley full of trenches."
2 Kings,3,17,"For thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , You 2f shall not see wind, neither shall you 2f see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that you 2f may drink, both you 2f , and your cattle, and your beasts."
2 Kings,3,18,And this is [but] a light thing in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : he will deliver the Mo’avi [of his father] also into your hand.
2 Kings,3,19,"And you 2f shall strike every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones."
2 Kings,3,20,"And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom [Red] , and the country was filled with water."
2 Kings,3,21,"And when all the Mo’avi [of his father] heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border."
2 Kings,3,22,"And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Mo’avi [of his father] saw the water on the other side [as] red as blood:"
2 Kings,3,23,"And they said, This [is] blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , to the spoil (plunder; prey; booty)."
2 Kings,3,24,"And when they came to the camp of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , the Yisra’eli’s rose up and struck the Mo’avi [of his father] , so that they fled before them: but they went forward attacking the Mo’avi [of his father] , even in [their] country."
2 Kings,3,25,"And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kir-Hareset [wall of potsherds] left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about [it] , and struck it."
2 Kings,3,26,"And when the king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] saw that the battle was too much for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through [even] unto the king of Edom [Red] : but they could not."
2 Kings,3,27,"Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him [for] a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and they departed from him, and returned to [their own] land."
2 Kings,4,1,"Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Eli-sha [my God is salvation] , saying, Your 1s servant my husband is dead; and you i know that your i servant did fear the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and the creditor is come to take with him my two sons to be slaves."
2 Kings,4,2,"And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] said unto her, What shall I do for you i ? tell me, what have you i in the house? And she said, Your 1s female servant has not anything in the house, save a pot of oil."
2 Kings,4,3,"Then he said, Go, borrow you i containers from all your i neighbours, [even] empty vessels; borrow not a few."
2 Kings,4,4,"And when you i are come in, you i shall shut the door upon you i and upon your i sons, and shall pour out into all those vessels, and you i shall set aside that which is full."
2 Kings,4,5,"So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought [the vessels] to her; and she poured out."
2 Kings,4,6,"And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me another vessel. And he said unto her, [There is] not a vessel more. And the oil stopped flowing."
2 Kings,4,7,"Then she came and told the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] . And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your i debt, and live you i and your i children off the rest."
2 Kings,4,8,"And it fell on a day, that Eli-sha [my God is salvation] passed to Shunem [Double Resting Place] , where [was] a well-to-do woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And [so] it was, [that] as oft as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread."
2 Kings,4,9,"And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this [is] an holy man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which passes by us continually."
2 Kings,4,10,"Let us make a little chamber, I pray you i , on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in there."
2 Kings,4,11,"And it fell on a day, that he came there, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there."
2 Kings,4,12,"And he said to Geichazi [valley of vision] his servant, Call this Shunamit [double resting place] . And when he had called her, she stood before him."
2 Kings,4,13,"And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, you i have shown us so much hospitality; what [is] to be done for you i ? would you i be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among my own people."
2 Kings,4,14,"And he said, What then [is] to be done for her? And Geichazi [valley of vision] answered, Truly she has no child, and her husband is old."
2 Kings,4,15,"And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door."
2 Kings,4,16,"And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, you i shall embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, [you i ] man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , do not lie unto your i female servant."
2 Kings,4,17,"And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season that Eli-sha [my God is salvation] had said unto her, according to the time of life."
2 Kings,4,18,"And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers."
2 Kings,4,19,"And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a boy, Carry him to his mother."
2 Kings,4,20,"And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and [then] died."
2 Kings,4,21,"And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and shut [the door] upon him, and went out."
2 Kings,4,22,"And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray you i , one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and come again."
2 Kings,4,23,"And he said, For what reason will you i go to him to day? [it is] neither new moon, nor Shabbat [Rest] . And she said, [It shall be] well (It will be alright)."
2 Kings,4,24,"Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not [your i ] riding for me, unless I say so to you i."
2 Kings,4,25,"So she went and came unto the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] to mount Carmel [Garden-land] . And it came to pass, when the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] saw her afar off, that he said to Geichazi [valley of vision] his servant, Behold, [over there is] that Shunamit [double resting place]:"
2 Kings,4,26,"Run now, I pray you i , to meet her, and say unto her, [Is it] well with you i? [is it] well with you i husband? [is it] well with the child? And she answered, [It is] well."
2 Kings,4,27,"And when she came to the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Geichazi [valley of vision] came near to thrust her away. And the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] said, Let her alone; for her soul [is] vexed within her: and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has hid [it] from me, and has not told me."
2 Kings,4,28,"Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?"
2 Kings,4,29,"Then he said to Geichazi [valley of vision] , Get dressed for action, and take my staff in your i hand, and go on your i way: if you i meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute you i , answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child."
2 Kings,4,30,"And the mother of the child said, [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, and [as] yorui soul lives, I will not leave you i . And he arose, and followed her."
2 Kings,4,31,"And Geichazi [valley of vision] passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but [there was] neither voice, nor hearing. For this reason he went again to meet him (Eli-sha) , and told him, saying, The child is not awakened."
2 Kings,4,32,"And when Eli-sha [my God is salvation] was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, [and] laid upon his bed."
2 Kings,4,33,"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them both, and prayed unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,4,34,"And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child grew warm."
2 Kings,4,35,"Then he went down, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes."
2 Kings,4,36,"And he called Geichazi [valley of vision] , and said, Call this Shunamit [double resting place] . So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up your i son."
2 Kings,4,37,"Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out."
2 Kings,4,38,"And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] came again to Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] : and [there was] a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets [were] sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets."
2 Kings,4,39,"And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred [them] into the pot of pottage: they didn’t know what they were."
2 Kings,4,40,"So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O [you i ] man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered], [there is] death in the pot. And they could not eat [of it]."
2 Kings,4,41,"But he said, Then bring flour. And he cast [it] into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was nothing harmful in the pot."
2 Kings,4,42,"And there came a man from Ba’al-Shalishah [thrice-great lord] , and brought the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat."
2 Kings,4,43,"And his servant said, How should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , They shall eat, and shall have some leftover of it."
2 Kings,4,44,"So he set [it] before them, and they did eat, and had some left over, according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,5,1,"Now Na’aman [Pleasantness] , captain of the host of the king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] , was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had given deliverance unto Aram (Syria) [exalted] : he was also a mighty man in valour, [but he was] a leper."
2 Kings,5,2,"And the Aram [Syrians] had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] a little maid; and she waited on Na’aman [Pleasantness] ’s wife."
2 Kings,5,3,"And she said unto her mistress, Would God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] my lord [were] with the prophet that [is] in Shomron [watch mountain] ! for he would heal him of his leprosy."
2 Kings,5,4,"And [one] went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that [is] of the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,5,5,"And the king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] said, Go ahead, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] . And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand [pieces] of gold, and ten changes of clothing."
2 Kings,5,6,"And he brought the letter to the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, Now when this letter is come unto you i , behold, I have [along with it] sent Na’aman [Pleasantness] my servant to you i , that you i may heal him of his leprosy."
2 Kings,5,7,"And it came to pass, when the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, [Am] I God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , to kill and to make alive, that this man does send unto me to heal a man of his leprosy? Therefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeks a quarrel against me."
2 Kings,5,8,"And it was [so] , when Eli-sha [my God is salvation] the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had heard that the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, For what reason have you i rent your i clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,5,9,"So Na’aman [Pleasantness] came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Eli-sha [my God is salvation]."
2 Kings,5,10,"And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Yarden [Descender] seven times, and your i flesh shall come again to you i , and you i shall be clean."
2 Kings,5,11,"But Na’aman [Pleasantness] was exceedingly angry, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leper."
2 Kings,5,12," [Are] not Amanah (Avnah) [faith, support] and Parpar [swift] , rivers of Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] , better than all the waters of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage."
2 Kings,5,13,"And his servants came near, and spoke unto him, and said, My father, [if] the prophet had bid you i [do some] difficult thing, would you i not have done [it] ? how much rather then, when he says to you i , Wash, and be clean?"
2 Kings,5,14,"Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Yarden [Descender] , according to the saying of the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean."
2 Kings,5,15,"And he returned to the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that [there is] no God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in all the earth, but in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : now therefore, I pray you i , take a blessing of your i servant."
2 Kings,5,16,"But he said, [As] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take [it] ; but he refused."
2 Kings,5,17,"And Na’aman [Pleasantness] said, Shall there not then, I pray you i , be given to your i servant two mules’ burden of earth? for your i servant will from this time forward offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,5,18,"In this thing the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) pardon your i servant, [that] when my master goes into the house of Rimmon [Pomegranate] to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon [Pomegranate] : when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon [Pomegranate] , the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) pardon your i servant in this thing."
2 Kings,5,19,"And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him after a short distance."
2 Kings,5,20,"But Geichazi [valley of vision] , the servant of Eli-sha [my God is salvation] the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , said, Behold, my master has spared Na’aman [Pleasantness] this Arami [exalted] , in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, [as] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, I will run after him, and take something of him."
2 Kings,5,21,"So Geichazi [valley of vision] followed after Na’aman [Pleasantness] . And when Na’aman [Pleasantness] saw [him] running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him, and said, [Is] all well?"
2 Kings,5,22,"And he said, All [is] well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray you i , a talent (weight of money; weight; gift) of silver, and two changes of garments."
2 Kings,5,23,"And Na’aman [Pleasantness] said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid [them] upon two of his servants; and they carried [them] before him."
2 Kings,5,24,"And when he came to the tower, he took [them] from their hand, and placed [them] in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed."
2 Kings,5,25,"But he went in, and stood before his master. And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] said unto him, From where do you i come, Geichazi [valley of vision] ? And he said, Your 1s servant went nowhere."
2 Kings,5,26,"And he said unto him, Went not my heart [with you i ], when the man turned again from his chariot to meet you i? [Is it] a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?"
2 Kings,5,27,"The leprosy therefore of Na’aman [Pleasantness] shall cling unto you i , and unto your i descendants forever. And he went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow."
2 Kings,6,1,"And the sons of the prophets said unto Eli-sha [my God is salvation] , Behold now, the place where we dwell with you i is too small for us."
2 Kings,6,2,"Let us go, we pray you i , unto Yarden [Descender] , and take there every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go you 2f."
2 Kings,6,3,"And one said, Be content, I pray you i , and go with your i servants. And he answered, I will go."
2 Kings,6,4,"So he went with them. And when they came to Yarden [Descender] , they cut down wood."
2 Kings,6,5,"But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed."
2 Kings,6,6,"And the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast [it] in there; and the iron did swim."
2 Kings,6,7,"Therefore said he, Take [it] up to you i . And he put out his hand, and took it."
2 Kings,6,8,"Then the king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] warred against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place [shall be] my camp."
2 Kings,6,9,"And the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] sent unto the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, Beware that you i pass not such a place; for there the Aram [Syrians] are come down."
2 Kings,6,10,"And the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] sent to the place which the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, more than once or twice."
2 Kings,6,11,"Therefore the heart of the king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] was greatly troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will you 2f not show me which of us [is] (a traitor) for the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
2 Kings,6,12,"And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Eli-sha [my God is salvation] , the prophet that [is] in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , tells the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] the words that you i speak in your i bedchamber."
2 Kings,6,13,"And he said, Go and spy where he [is] , that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, [he is] in Dotan [two wells]."
2 Kings,6,14,"Therefore sent he there horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and surrounded the city about."
2 Kings,6,15,"And when the servant of the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, This is terrible, my master! what shall we do?"
2 Kings,6,16,"And he answered, Fear not: for they that [be] with us [are] more than they that [be] with them."
2 Kings,6,17,"And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] prayed, and said, Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , I pray you i , open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain [was] full of horses and chariots of fire round about Eli-sha [my God is salvation]."
2 Kings,6,18,"And when they came down to him, Eli-sha [my God is salvation] prayed unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, Strike this people, I pray you i , with blindness. And He struck them with blindness according to the word of Eli-sha [my God is salvation]."
2 Kings,6,19,"And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] said unto them, This [is] not the way, neither [is] this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you 2f seek. But he led them to Shomron [watch mountain]."
2 Kings,6,20,"And it came to pass, when they were come into Shomron [watch mountain] , that Eli-sha [my God is salvation] said, Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , open the eyes of these [men] , that they may see. And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, [they were] in the midst of Shomron [watch mountain]."
2 Kings,6,21,"And the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said unto Eli-sha [my God is salvation] , when he saw them, My father, shall I strike [them] ? shall I strike [them]?"
2 Kings,6,22,"And he answered, you i shall not strike [them] : would you i strike those whom you i have taken captive with your i sword and with your i bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master."
2 Kings,6,23,"And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Aram (Syria) [exalted] came no more into the land of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,6,24,"And it came to pass after this, that Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Shomron [watch mountain]."
2 Kings,6,25,"And there was a great famine in Shomron [watch mountain] : and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass’s head was [sold] for eighty [pieces] of silver, and the fourth part of a half a pint of dove’s dung for five [pieces] of silver."
2 Kings,6,26,"And as the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king."
2 Kings,6,27,"And he said, If the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) do not help you i , in from where shall I [find] help you i ? out of the barn floor, or out of the winepress?"
2 Kings,6,28,"And the king said unto her, What ails you i ? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give your i son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son tomorrow."
2 Kings,6,29,"So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give your i son, that we may eat him: and she has hid her son."
2 Kings,6,30,"And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, [he had] sackcloth there upon his flesh."
2 Kings,6,31,"Then he said, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] do so and more also to me, if the head of Eli-sha [my God is salvation] the son of Shafat [He Has Judged] shall stand on him this day."
2 Kings,6,32,"But Eli-sha [my God is salvation] sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and [the king] sent a man from before him: but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See you 2f how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: [is] not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?"
2 Kings,6,33,"And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil [is] of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; why should I wait for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) any longer?"
2 Kings,7,1,"Then Eli-sha [my God is salvation] said, Hear you 2f the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Tomorrow about this time [shall] a measure of fine flour [be sold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Shomron [watch mountain]."
2 Kings,7,2,"Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and said, Behold, [if] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, you i shall see [it] with your i eyes, but shall not eat of it."
2 Kings,7,3,"And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?"
2 Kings,7,4,"If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine [is] in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Aram [Syrians] : if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall only die."
2 Kings,7,5,"And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Aram [Syrians] : and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Aram (Syria) [exalted] , behold, [there was] no man there."
2 Kings,7,6,"For the Lord-Adonai (The Father) [greatest above all] had made the host of the Aram [Syrians] to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, [even] the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Wow!, the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] has hired against us the kings of the Hitti [Terrorists] , and the kings of the Mitzri, to come upon us."
2 Kings,7,7,"For this reason they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it [was] , and fled for their lives."
2 Kings,7,8,"And when these lepers came to the outskirts part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried from there silver, and gold, and clothing, and went and hid [it] ; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried from there [also] , and went and hid [it]."
2 Kings,7,9,"Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day [is] a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we wait till the morning light, some evil will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king’s household."
2 Kings,7,10,"So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Aram [Syrians] , and, behold, [there was] no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they [were empty]."
2 Kings,7,11,And he called the porters; and they told [it] to the king’s house within.
2 Kings,7,12,"And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now show you what the Aram [Syrians] have done to us. They know that we [be] hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city."
2 Kings,7,13,"And one of his servants answered and said, Let [some] take, I pray you i , five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they [are] as all the multitude of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that are left in it: behold, [I say], they [are] even as all the multitude of the Yisra’eli’s that are consumed) and let us send them out and see."
2 Kings,7,14,"They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Aram [Syrians] , saying, Go and see."
2 Kings,7,15,"And they went after them unto Yarden [Descender] : and, to their amazement, all the way [was] full of garments and vessels, which the Aram [Syrians] had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king."
2 Kings,7,16,"And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Aram [Syrians] . So a measure of fine flour was [sold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,7,17,"And the king appointed that lord on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate: and the people trampled him down in the gate, and he died, as the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had said he would, who spoke when the king came down to him."
2 Kings,7,18,"And it came to pass as the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Shomron [watch mountain]:"
2 Kings,7,19,"And that lord answered the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and said, Now, behold, [if] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, you i shall see it with your i eyes, but shall not eat thereof."
2 Kings,7,20,"And so it fell out unto him: for the people trampled upon him in the gate, and he died."
2 Kings,8,1,"Then spoke Eli-sha [my God is salvation] unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go you i and your i household, and stay wherever you i can stay: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years."
2 Kings,8,2,"And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : and she went with her household, and detained (held) in the land of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] seven years."
2 Kings,8,3,"And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman returned out of the land of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] : and she went forth to claim unto the king for her house and for her land."
2 Kings,8,4,"And the king talked with Geichazi [valley of vision] the servant of the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , saying, Tell me, I pray you i , all the great things that Eli-sha [my God is salvation] has done."
2 Kings,8,5,"And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Geichazi [valley of vision] said, My lord, O king, this [is] the woman, and this [is] her son, whom Eli-sha [my God is salvation] restored to life."
2 Kings,8,6,"And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that [was] hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now."
2 Kings,8,7,"And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] came to Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] ; and Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] the king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] is come here."
2 Kings,8,8,"And the king said unto Haza’el [one who sees God] , Take a present in your i hand, and go, meet the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and enquire of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?"
2 Kings,8,9,"So Haza’el [one who sees God] went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] , forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Your 1s son Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] has sent me to you i , saying, Shall I recover of this disease?"
2 Kings,8,10,"And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] said unto him, Go, say unto him, you i may certainly recover: howbeit the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has showed me that he shall surely die."
2 Kings,8,11,And he settled his gaze on the man so long that he (Haza’el) was ashamed: and the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] wept.
2 Kings,8,12,"And Haza’el [one who sees God] said, Why weep my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that you i will do unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : their strong holds will you i set on fire, and their young men will you i slay with the sword, and will dash their children, and rip up their women with child."
2 Kings,8,13,"And Haza’el [one who sees God] said, But what, [is] your i servant? a dog? that he should do this great thing? And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] answered, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has showed me that you i [shall be] king over Aram (Syria) [exalted]."
2 Kings,8,14,"So he departed from Eli-sha [my God is salvation] , and came to his master; who said to him, What said Eli-sha [my God is salvation] to you i ? And he answered, He told me [that] you i should surely recover."
2 Kings,8,15,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped [it] in water, and spread [it] on his face, so that he died: and Haza’el [one who sees God] reigned in his place."
2 Kings,8,16,"And in the fifth year of Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] the son of Ach’av [father’s brother] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] [being] then king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] the son of Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] began to reign."
2 Kings,8,17,Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace].
2 Kings,8,18,"And he walked in the way of the kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , as did the house of Ach’av [father’s brother] : for the daughter of Ach’av [father’s brother] was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,8,19,"Yet the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) would not destroy Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] for David [beloved] his servant’s sake, as he promised him to give him always a light, [and] to his children."
2 Kings,8,20,"In his days Edom [Red] revolted from under the hand of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and made a king over themselves."
2 Kings,8,21,"So Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] went over to Tza’ir [small] , and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and struck the Edomi [red] which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents."
2 Kings,8,22,Yet Edom [Red] revolted from under the hand of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] unto this day. Then Livnah [Pavement] revolted at the same time.
2 Kings,8,23,"And the rest of the acts of Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] , and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]?"
2 Kings,8,24,"And Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David [beloved] : and Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] his son reigned in his stead."
2 Kings,8,25,In the twelfth year of Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] the son of Ach’av [father’s brother] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] the son of Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] begin to reign.
2 Kings,8,26,"Two and twenty years old [was] Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And his mother’s name [was] ‘Atalyahu [afflicted of the Lord] , the daughter of ‘Omri [pupil of Yehovah] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,8,27,"And he walked in the way of the house of Ach’av [father’s brother] , and did evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , as [did] the house of Ach’av [father’s brother] : for he [was] the son in law of the house of Ach’av [father’s brother]."
2 Kings,8,28,And he went with Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] the son of Ach’av [father’s brother] to the war against Haza’el [one who sees God] king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] in Ramot-Gil’ad [rocky region] ; and the Aram [Syrians] wounded Yoram [Yehovah is exalted].
2 Kings,8,29,"And king Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] went back to be healed in Yizre’el [God Sows] of the wounds which the Aram [Syrians] had given him at Ramah [Hill] , when he fought against Haza’el [one who sees God] king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] . And Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] the son of Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] went down to see Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] the son of Ach’av [father’s brother] in Yizre’el [God Sows] , because he was sick."
2 Kings,9,1,"And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up your i waist, and take this box of oil in your i hand, and go to Ramot-Gil’ad [rocky region]:"
2 Kings,9,2,"And when you i come there, look out there for Yehu [Yehovah is He] the son of Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] the son of Nimshi [rescued] , and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;"
2 Kings,9,3,"Then take the box of oil, and pour [it] on his head, and say, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , I have anointed you i king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] . Then open the door, and flee, and wait not."
2 Kings,9,4,"So the young man, [even] the young man the prophet, went to Ramot-Gil’ad [rocky region]."
2 Kings,9,5,"And when he came, behold, the captains of the host [were] sitting; and he said, I have an errand to you i , O captain. And Yehu [Yehovah is He] said, Unto which of us? And he said, To you i , O captain."
2 Kings,9,6,"And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , I have anointed you i king over the people of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [even] over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,9,7,"And you i shall strike the house of Ach’av [father’s brother] your i master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , at the hand of Izevel [Ba’al exalts]."
2 Kings,9,8,"For the whole house of Ach’av [father’s brother] shall perish: and I will cut off from Ach’av [father’s brother] him that pisses against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]:"
2 Kings,9,9,"And I will make the house of Ach’av [father’s brother] like the house of Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , and like the house of Ba’sha [wicked] the son of Achiyah [brother of Yehovah]:"
2 Kings,9,10,"And the dogs shall eat Izevel [Ba’al exalts] in the dumping-ground of Yizre’el [God Sows] , and [there shall be] none to bury [her] . And he opened the door, and fled."
2 Kings,9,11,"Then Yehu [Yehovah is He] came forth to the servants of his lord: and [one] said unto him, [Is] all well? For what reason came this mad [fellow] to you i ? And he said unto them, You 2f know the man, and his communication."
2 Kings,9,12,"And they said, [It is] not true; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spoke he to me, saying, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , I have anointed you i king over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,9,13,"Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put [it] under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Yehu [Yehovah is He] is king."
2 Kings,9,14,"So Yehu [Yehovah is He] the son of Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] the son of Nimshi [rescued] conspired against Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] . (Now Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] had kept Ramot-Gil’ad [rocky region] , he and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , because of Haza’el [one who sees God] king of Aram (Syria) [exalted]."
2 Kings,9,15,"But king Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] was returned to be healed in Yizre’el [God Sows] of the wounds which the Aram [Syrians] had given him, when he fought with Haza’el [one who sees God] king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] .) And Yehu [Yehovah is He] said, If it be your minds, [then] let none go forth [nor] escape out of the city to go to tell [it] in Yizre’el [God Sows]."
2 Kings,9,16,"So Yehu [Yehovah is He] rode in a chariot, and went to Yizre’el [God Sows] ; for Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] lay there. And Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] was come down to see Yoram [Yehovah is exalted]."
2 Kings,9,17,"And there stood a watchman on the tower in Yizre’el [God Sows] , and he spied the company of Yehu [Yehovah is He] as he came, and said, I see a company. And Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, [Do you come in] peace?"
2 Kings,9,18,"So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus says the king, [Is it] peace? And Yehu [Yehovah is He] said, What have you i to do with peace? turn you i behind me. And the watchman explained (to the king) , saying, The messenger came to them, but he comes not again."
2 Kings,9,19,"Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus says the king, [Is it] peace? And Yehu [Yehovah is He] answered, What have you i to do with peace? turn you i behind me."
2 Kings,9,20,"And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and comes not again: and the driving [is] like the driving of Yehu [Yehovah is He] the son of Nimshi [rescued] ; for he drives furiously."
2 Kings,9,21,"And Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Yehu [Yehovah is He] , and met him in the portion of Navot [fruits] the Yizre’eli [God Sows]."
2 Kings,9,22,"And it came to pass, when Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] saw Yehu [Yehovah is He] , that he said, [Is it] peace, Yehu [Yehovah is He] ? And he answered, What peace, so long as the cult prostitution of your i mother Izevel [Ba’al exalts] and her witchcrafts [are so] many?"
2 Kings,9,23,"And Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] turned his hands, and fled, and said to Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] , Treachery! O Achazyah [Yehovah possesses]!"
2 Kings,9,24,"And Yehu [Yehovah is He] drew a bow with his full strength, and struck Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot."
2 Kings,9,25,"Then said [Yehu [Yehovah is He]] to Bidkar [with a stab] his captain, Pick him up, [and] cast him in the portion of the field of Navot [fruits] the Yizre’eli [God Sows] : for remember how that, when I and you i rode together after Ach’av [father’s brother] his father, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) pronounced this sentence upon him;"
2 Kings,9,26,"Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Navot [fruits] , and the blood of his sons, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and I will pay you i back in this field, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . Now therefore take [and] cast him into the field [of ground] , according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,9,27,"But when Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] the king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] saw [this] , he fled by the way of the garden house. And Yehu [Yehovah is He] followed after him, and said, Strike him also in the chariot. [And they did so] at the going up to Gur [sojourning] , which [is] by Yivle’am [Devouring the People] . And he fled to Megiddo [Place of Crowds] , and died there."
2 Kings,9,28,"And his servants carried him in a chariot to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and buried him in his sepulcher with his fathers in the city of David [beloved]."
2 Kings,9,29,And in the eleventh year of Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] the son of Ach’av [father’s brother] began Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] to reign over Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised].
2 Kings,9,30,"And when Yehu [Yehovah is He] was come to Yizre’el [God Sows] , Izevel [Ba’al exalts] heard [of it] ; and she painted her face, and fixed her hair, and looked out the window."
2 Kings,9,31,"And as Yehu [Yehovah is He] entered in at the gate, she said, [Are you here in] peace Zimri [My Music] ? who murdered his master?"
2 Kings,9,32,"And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who [is] on my side? who? And there looked out to him two [or] three eunuchs."
2 Kings,9,33,"And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and [some] of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trampled her under foot."
2 Kings,9,34,"And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed [woman] , and bury her: for she [is] a king’s daughter."
2 Kings,9,35,"And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of [her] hands."
2 Kings,9,36,"For this reason they came again, and told him. And he said, This [is] the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he spoke by his servant Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] the Tishbi [captivity] , saying, In the portion of Yizre’el [God Sows] shall dogs eat the flesh of Izevel [Ba’al exalts]:"
2 Kings,9,37,"And the carcass of Izevel [Ba’al exalts] shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Yizre’el [God Sows]; [so] that they shall not say, This [is] Izevel [Ba’al exalts]."
2 Kings,10,1,"And Ach’av [father’s brother] had seventy sons in Shomron [watch mountain] . And Yehu [Yehovah is He] wrote letters, and sent to Shomron [watch mountain] , unto the rulers of Yizre’el [God Sows] , to the elders, and to them that brought up Ach’av’s [father’s brother] [children] , saying,"
2 Kings,10,2,"Now as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master’s sons [are] with you, and [there are] with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour;"
2 Kings,10,3,"Look even out the best and most suitable of your master’s sons, and set [him] on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house."
2 Kings,10,4,"But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?"
2 Kings,10,5,"And he that [was] over the house, and he that [was] over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up [of the children] , sent to Yehu [Yehovah is He] , saying, We [are] your i servants, and will do all that you i shall bid us; we will not make any king: do you i [that which is] good in your i eyes."
2 Kings,10,6,"Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If you 2f [be] mine, and [if] you 2f will hearken unto my voice, take you 2f the heads of the men your master’s sons, and come to me to Yizre’el [God Sows] by tomorrow this time. Now the king’s sons, [being] seventy persons, [were] with the great men of the city, which brought them up."
2 Kings,10,7,"And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons, and killed seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him [them] to Yizre’el [God Sows]."
2 Kings,10,8,"And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay you 2f them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning."
2 Kings,10,9,"And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, You 2f [be] righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and killed him: but who killed all these?"
2 Kings,10,10,"Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke concerning the house of Ach’av [father’s brother] : for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has done [that] which he spoke by his servant Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah]."
2 Kings,10,11,"So Yehu [Yehovah is He] killed all that remained of the house of Ach’av [father’s brother] in Yizre’el [God Sows] , and all his great men, and his relatives, and his priests, until he left him none remaining."
2 Kings,10,12,"And he arose and departed, and came to Shomron [watch mountain]. [And] as he [was] at the shearing house in the way,"
2 Kings,10,13,"Yehu [Yehovah is He] met with the brethren of Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and said, Who [are] you 2f ? And they answered, We [are] the brethren of Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] ; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen."
2 Kings,10,14,"And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and killed them at the pit of the shearing house, [even] two and forty men; neither left he any of them [alive]."
2 Kings,10,15,"And when he was departed there, he lighted on Y’honadav [Yehovah is willing] the son of Rekhav [rider] [coming] to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is your i heart right, as my heart [is] with your i heart? And Y’honadav [Yehovah is willing] answered, It is. If it be, give [me] your i hand. And he gave [him] his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot."
2 Kings,10,16,"And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . So they made him ride in his chariot."
2 Kings,10,17,"And when he came to Shomron [watch mountain] , he killed all that remained unto Ach’av [father’s brother] in Shomron [watch mountain] , till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he spoke to Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah]."
2 Kings,10,18,"And Yehu [Yehovah is He] gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ach’av [father’s brother] served Ba’al [lord (a false god)] a little; [but] Yehu [Yehovah is He] shall serve him much."
2 Kings,10,19,"Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice [to do] to Ba’al [lord (a false god)] ; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Yehu [Yehovah is He] did [it] in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Ba’al [lord (a false god)]."
2 Kings,10,20,"And Yehu [Yehovah is He] said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Ba’al [lord (a false god)] . And they proclaimed [it]."
2 Kings,10,21,"And Yehu [Yehovah is He] sent through all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and all the worshippers of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] ; and the house of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] was full from one end to another."
2 Kings,10,22,"And he said unto him that [was] over the wardrobe, Bring forth robes for all the worshippers of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] . And he brought them forth robes."
2 Kings,10,23,"And Yehu [Yehovah is He] went, and Y’honadav [Yehovah is willing] the son of Rekhav [rider] , into the house of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , and said unto the worshippers of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , but the worshippers of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] only."
2 Kings,10,24,"And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Yehu [Yehovah is He] appointed eighty men without, and said, [If] any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, [he that lets him go] , his life [shall be] for the life of him."
2 Kings,10,25,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Yehu [Yehovah is He] said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, [and] slay them; let none come forth. And they struck them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast [them] out, and went to the city of the house of Ba’al [lord (a false god)]."
2 Kings,10,26,"And they brought forth the images out of the house of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , and burned them."
2 Kings,10,27,"And they broke down the image of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , and broke down the house of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , and made it a latrine unto this day."
2 Kings,10,28,Thus Yehu [Yehovah is He] destroyed Ba’al [lord (a false god)] out of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
2 Kings,10,29,"However [from] the sins of Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , who made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin, Yehu [Yehovah is He] departed not from after them, [that is to say] , the golden calves that [were] in Beit-El [House of God] , and that [were] in Dan [Judge]."
2 Kings,10,30,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Yehu [Yehovah is He] , Because you i have done well in executing [that which is] right in my eyes, [and] have done unto the house of Ach’av [father’s brother] according to all that [was] in my heart, your i children of the fourth [generation] shall sit on the throne of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,10,31,"But Yehu [Yehovah is He] took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Yarov’am [the people will contend] , which made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin."
2 Kings,10,32,In those days the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) began to cut Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] short: and Haza’el [one who sees God] struck them in all the coasts of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God];
2 Kings,10,33,"From Yarden [Descender] eastward, all the land of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , the Gadi [my fortune] [A Troop] , and the Re’uveni [behold, a son!] , and the M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , from ‘Aeo’er [Ruins] , which [is] by the river ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] , even Gil’ad [Rocky Region] and Bashan [Fruitful]."
2 Kings,10,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Yehu [Yehovah is He] , and all that he did, and all his might, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
2 Kings,10,35,And Yehu [Yehovah is He] slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Shomron [watch mountain] . And Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings,10,36,And the time that Yehu [Yehovah is He] reigned over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in Shomron [watch mountain] [was] twenty and eight years.
2 Kings,11,1,"And when ‘Atalyahu [afflicted of the Lord] the mother of Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal."
2 Kings,11,2,"But Y’hosheva [Yehovah has sworn] , the daughter of king Yoram [Yehovah is exalted] , sister of Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] , took Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] the son of Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] , and stole him from among the king’s sons [which were] slain; and they hid him, [even] him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from ‘Atalyahu [afflicted of the Lord] , so that he was not slain."
2 Kings,11,3,And he was with her hid in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) six years. And ‘Atalyahu [afflicted of the Lord] did reign over the land.
2 Kings,11,4,"And the seventh year Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and showed them the king’s son."
2 Kings,11,5,"And he commanded them, saying, This [is] the thing that you 2f shall do; A tles hird part of you that enter in on the Shabbat [Rest] shall even be keepers of the watch of the king’s house;"
2 Kings,11,6,"And a third part [shall be] at the gate of Sur [turning aside] ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall you 2f keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down."
2 Kings,11,7,"And two parts of all you that go forth on the Shabbat [Rest] , even they shall keep the watch of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) about the king."
2 Kings,11,8,"And you 2f shall compass (go around, encircle; encompass) the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that comes within the ranges, let him be slain: and be you 2f with the king as he goes out and as he comes in."
2 Kings,11,9,"And the captains over the hundreds did according to all [things] that Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the Shabbat [Rest] , with them that should go out on the Shabbat [Rest] , and came to Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] the priest."
2 Kings,11,10,"And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David’s [beloved] ’s spears and shields, that [were] in the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,11,11,"And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, [along] by the altar and the temple."
2 Kings,11,12,"And he brought forth the king’s son, and put the crown upon him, and [gave him] the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, Long live the king!"
2 Kings,11,13,"And when ‘Atalyahu [afflicted of the Lord] heard the noise of the guard [and] of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,11,14,"And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the custom [was] , and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and ‘Atalyahu [afflicted of the Lord] rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason!"
2 Kings,11,15,"But Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Bring her forth out past the ranks [of guards] : and him that follows her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,11,16,And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king’s house: and there was she slain.
2 Kings,11,17,"And Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] made a covenant between the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) and the king and the people, that they should be the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] people; between the king also and the people."
2 Kings,11,18,"And all the people of the land went into the house of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , and broke it down; his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan [a gift] the priest of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,11,19,"And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings."
2 Kings,11,20,"And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they killed ‘Atalyahu [afflicted of the Lord] with the sword [beside] the king’s house."
2 Kings,11,21,Seven years old [was] Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] when he began to reign.
2 Kings,12,1,In the seventh year of Yehu [Yehovah is He] Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And his mother’s name [was] Tzivyah [roe] of Be’er-sheva [Well of the sevenfold Oath].
2 Kings,12,2,And Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] did [that which was] right in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) all his days wherein Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] the priest instructed him.
2 Kings,12,3,But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
2 Kings,12,4,"And Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [even] the money of everyone that passes [the account] , the money that every man is set at, [and] all the money that comes into any man’s heart to bring into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate),"
2 Kings,12,5,"Let the priests take [it] to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wherever any breach (breaking forth; a break; opening, inlet) shall be found."
2 Kings,12,6,"But it was [so, that] in the three and twentieth year of king Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house."
2 Kings,12,7,"Then king Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] called for Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] the priest, and the [other] priests, and said unto them, Why repair you 2f not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no [more] money of those who contribute personally to you, but deliver it for the breaches of the house."
2 Kings,12,8,"And the priests consented to receive no [more] money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house."
2 Kings,12,9,"But Y’hoyada [Yehovah knows] the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and the priests that kept the door put in it all the money [that was] brought into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,12,10,"And it was [so] , when they saw that [there was] much money in the chest, that the king’s scribe and the High Priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,12,11,"And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that worked upon the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate),"
2 Kings,12,12,"And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair [it]."
2 Kings,12,13,"However there were not made for the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money [that was] brought into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate):"
2 Kings,12,14,"But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired with that the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,12,15,"Moreover they did not require and accounting with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be given to the workmen: for they dealt honestly."
2 Kings,12,16,The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : it belonged to the priests’.
2 Kings,12,17,"Then Haza’el [one who sees God] king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] went up, and fought against Gat [Winepress] , and took it: and Haza’el [one who sees God] set his face to go up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Kings,12,18,"And Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] took all the consecrated things that Y’hoshafat [Yehovah has judged] , and Y’horam [Yehovah is exalted] , and Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] , his fathers, kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , had dedicated, and his own consecrated things, and all the gold [that was] found in the treasures of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and in the king’s house, and sent [it] to Haza’el [one who sees God] king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] : and he went away from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Kings,12,19,"And the rest of the acts of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] , and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]?"
2 Kings,12,20,"And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and killed Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] in the Beit-Millo [fortification (defensive structure) or mound] [House of the Fortification (defensive structure)] , which goes down to Sila [a highway]."
2 Kings,12,21,"For Yozakhar [Yehovah remembers] the son of Shim’at [report] , and Y’hozavad [Yehovah has endowed] the son of Shomer [keeper] , his servants, struck him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David [beloved] : and Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] his son reigned in his stead."
2 Kings,13,1,"In the three and twentieth year of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] the son of Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] the son of Yehu [Yehovah is He] began to reign over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in Shomron [watch mountain], [and reigned] seventeen years."
2 Kings,13,2,"And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and followed the sins of Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , which made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin; he departed not from them."
2 Kings,13,3,"And the anger of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was kindled against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and he delivered them into the hand of Haza’el [one who sees God] king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] , and into the hand of Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] the son of Haza’el [one who sees God] , all [their] days."
2 Kings,13,4,"And Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] besought the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) listened unto him: for he saw the oppression of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , because the king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] oppressed them."
2 Kings,13,5,"(And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) gave Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Aram [Syrians] : and the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] dwelt in their tents, as formerly."
2 Kings,13,6,"Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Yarov’am [the people will contend] , who made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] sin, [but] walked in it: and there remained the grove also in Shomron [watch mountain] .)"
2 Kings,13,7,"Neither did he leave of the people to Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] but only fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing."
2 Kings,13,8,"Now the rest of the acts of Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] , and all that he did, and his might, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
2 Kings,13,9,And Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Shomron [watch mountain] : and Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] his son reigned in his place.
2 Kings,13,10,"In the thirty and seventh year of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] began Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] the son of Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] to reign over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in Shomron [watch mountain], [and reigned] sixteen years."
2 Kings,13,11,"And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; he departed not from all the sins of Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , who made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] sin: [but] he walked in it."
2 Kings,13,12,"And the rest of the acts of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] , and all that he did, and his might which he fought against Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised], [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
2 Kings,13,13,And Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] slept with his fathers; and Yarov’am [the people will contend] sat upon his throne: and Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] was buried in Shomron [watch mountain] with the kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
2 Kings,13,14,"Now Eli-sha [my God is salvation] was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and the horsemen thereof."
2 Kings,13,15,"And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows."
2 Kings,13,16,"And he said to the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Put your i hand upon the bow. And he put his hand [upon it] : and Eli-sha [my God is salvation] put his hands upon the king’s hands."
2 Kings,13,17,"And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened [it] . Then Eli-sha [my God is salvation] said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Aram (Syria) [exalted] : for you i shall strike the Aram [Syrians] in Aphek [Enclosure] , till you i have consumed [them]."
2 Kings,13,18,"And he said, Take the arrows. And he took [them] . And he said unto the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Strike upon the ground. And he struck thrice, and stopped."
2 Kings,13,19,"And the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was exceedingly angry with him, and said, you i should have smitten five or six times; then had you i smitten Aram (Syria) [exalted] till you i had consumed [it] : whereas now you i shall strike Aram (Syria) [exalted] [but] thrice."
2 Kings,13,20,"And Eli-sha [my God is salvation] died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Mo’avi [of his father] invaded the land at the coming in of the year."
2 Kings,13,21,"And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band [of men] ; and they cast the man into the sepulcher of Eli-sha [my God is salvation] : and when the man hinder (or obstruct) down, and touched the bones of Eli-sha [my God is salvation] , he revived, and stood up on his feet."
2 Kings,13,22,But Haza’el [one who sees God] king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] oppressed Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] all the days of Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized].
2 Kings,13,23,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Avraham [Exalted Father] , Yitz’khak [Laughter] , and Ya’akov [Heal of God] , and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet."
2 Kings,13,24,So Haza’el [one who sees God] king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] died; and Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings,13,25,"And Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] the son of Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] took again out of the hand of Ben-Hadad [son of the (false god) Hadad] the son of Haza’el [one who sees God] the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] his father by war. Three times did Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] beat him, and recovered the cities of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,14,1,In the second year of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] son of Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] reigned Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] the son of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised].
2 Kings,14,2,"He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned twenty and nine years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And his mother’s name [was] Y’ho’adan [Yehovah delights] of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Kings,14,3,"And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , yet not like David [beloved] his father: he did according to all things as Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] his father did."
2 Kings,14,4,However the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.
2 Kings,14,5,"And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he killed his servants which had slain the king his father."
2 Kings,14,6,"But the children of the murderers he killed not: according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , wherein the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin."
2 Kings,14,7,"He killed of Edom [Red] in the Valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Sela [the rocks] [the rock] by war, and called the name of it Yokte’el [The Blessedness of God] unto this day."
2 Kings,14,8,"Then Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] sent messengers to Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] , the son of Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] son of Yehu [Yehovah is He] , king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, Come, let us look one another in the face."
2 Kings,14,9,"And Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] sent to Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , saying, The thistle that [was] in L’vanon [Whiteness] sent to the cedar that [was] in L’vanon [Whiteness] , saying, Give your i daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that [was] in L’vanon [Whiteness] , and trampled down the thistle."
2 Kings,14,10,"you i have indeed smitten Edom [Red] , and your i heart has lifted you i up: glory [of this] , and wait at home: for why should you i meddle to [your i ] hurt, that you i should fall, [even] you i , and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] with you i?"
2 Kings,14,11,"But Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] would not hear. Therefore Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went up; and he and Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] looked one another in the face at Beit-Shemesh [House of the Sun] , which [belongs] to Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
2 Kings,14,12,And Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] was put to the worse before Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and they fled every man to their tents.
2 Kings,14,13,"And Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] took Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , the son of Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] the son of Achazyah [Yehovah possesses] , at Beit-Shemesh [House of the Sun] , and came to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and broke down the wall of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] from the gate of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] unto the corner gate, six hundred feet long."
2 Kings,14,14,"And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and in the treasures of the king’s house, and hostages, and returned to Shomron [watch mountain]."
2 Kings,14,15,"Now the rest of the acts of Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised], [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
2 Kings,14,16,"And Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] slept with his fathers, and was buried in Shomron [watch mountain] with the kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and Yarov’am [the people will contend] his son reigned in his stead."
2 Kings,14,17,And Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] the son of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] lived after the death of Y’ho’ash [given by the Lord] son of Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] fifteen years.
2 Kings,14,18,"And the rest of the acts of Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty], [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]?"
2 Kings,14,19,"Now they made a conspiracy against him in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : and he fled to Lakhish [Invincible] ; but they sent after him to Lakhish [Invincible] , and killed him there."
2 Kings,14,20,And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] with his fathers in the city of David [beloved].
2 Kings,14,21,"And all the people of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] took ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] , which [was] sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty]."
2 Kings,14,22,"He built Eilat [Grove of Lofty Trees] , and restored it to Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , after that the king slept with his fathers."
2 Kings,14,23,"In the fifteenth year of Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] the son of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] began to reign in Shomron [watch mountain], [and reigned] forty and one years."
2 Kings,14,24,"And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : he departed not from all the sins of Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , who made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin."
2 Kings,14,25,"He restored the coast of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] from the entering of Hamat [Fortress] unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which he spoke by the hand of his servant Yonah [dove] , the son of Amitai [my truth] , the prophet, which [was] of Gat-Hefer [the winepress of digging]."
2 Kings,14,26,"For the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) saw the affliction of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [that it was] very bitter: for [there was] not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,14,27,And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said not that he would blot out the name of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord].
2 Kings,14,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Yarov’am [the people will contend] , and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] , and Hamat [Fortress], [which belonged] to Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , for Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
2 Kings,14,29,"And Yarov’am [the people will contend] slept with his fathers, [even] with the kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers] [the Lord recalled] his son reigned in his place."
2 Kings,15,1,In the twenty and seventh year of Yarov’am [the people will contend] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] began ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] son of Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] to reign.
2 Kings,15,2,"Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And his mother’s name [was] Y’kholyahu [Yehovah is able] of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Kings,15,3,"And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , according to all that his father Amatzyah [Yehovah is mighty] had done;"
2 Kings,15,4,Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.
2 Kings,15,5,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) struck the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house. And Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] the king’s son [was] over the house, [as regent] judging the people of the land."
2 Kings,15,6,"And the rest of the acts of ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] , and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]?"
2 Kings,15,7,So ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David [beloved] : and Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings,15,8,In the thirty and eighth year of ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] did Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers] [the Lord recalled] the son of Yarov’am [the people will contend] reign over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in Shomron [watch mountain] six months.
2 Kings,15,9,"And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , who made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin."
2 Kings,15,10,"And Shalum [retribution] the son of Yavesh [dry] conspired against him, and struck him before the people, and killed him, and reigned in his stead."
2 Kings,15,11,"And the rest of the acts of Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers] [the Lord recalled] , behold, they [are] written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,15,12,"This [was] the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) which he spoke unto Yehu [Yehovah is He] , saying, Your 1s sons shall sit on the throne of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] unto the fourth [generation] . And so it came to pass."
2 Kings,15,13,Shalum [retribution] the son of Yavesh [dry] began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of ‘Uziyah [my strength is Yehovah] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ; and he reigned a full month in Shomron [watch mountain].
2 Kings,15,14,"For Menachem [comforter] the son of Gadi [my fortune] went up from Tirtzah [Favourable] , and came to Shomron [watch mountain] , and struck Shalum [retribution] the son of Yavesh [dry] in Shomron [watch mountain] , and killed him, and reigned in his stead."
2 Kings,15,15,"And the rest of the acts of Shalum [retribution] , and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they [are] written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,15,16,"Then Menachem [comforter] struck Tifsach [cross over] , and all that [were] in it, and the coasts thereof from Tirtzah [Favourable] : because they opened not [their gates to him] , therefore he struck [it; and] all the women in it that were with child he ripped up."
2 Kings,15,17,"In the nine and thirtieth year of ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] began Menachem [comforter] the son of Gadi [my fortune] to reign over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [and reigned] ten years in Shomron [watch mountain]."
2 Kings,15,18,"And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : he departed not all his days from the sins of Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , who made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin."
2 Kings,15,19," [And] Pul [distinguishing] the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) came against the land: and Menachem [comforter] gave Pul [distinguishing] a thirty-three tons of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand."
2 Kings,15,20,"And Menachem [comforter] exacted the money of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [even] of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) . So the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) turned back, and detained (held) not there in the land."
2 Kings,15,21,"And the rest of the acts of Menachem [comforter] , and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
2 Kings,15,22,And Menachem [comforter] slept with his fathers; and P’kachyah [Yehovah sees] his son reigned in his place.
2 Kings,15,23,"In the fiftieth year of ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] P’kachyah [Yehovah sees] the son of Menachem [comforter] began to reign over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in Shomron [watch mountain], [and reigned] two years."
2 Kings,15,24,"And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : he departed not from the sins of Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , who made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin."
2 Kings,15,25,"But Pekach [opened] the son of Remalyahu [protected by Yehovah] , a captain of his, conspired against him, and struck him in Shomron [watch mountain] , in the palace of the king’s house, with Argov [Heap of Clods] and Aryeh [lion] , and with him fifty men of the Gil’adi [son] : and he killed him, and reigned in his room."
2 Kings,15,26,"And the rest of the acts of P’kachyah [Yehovah sees] , and all that he did, behold, they [are] written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,15,27,"In the two and fiftieth year of ‘Azaryah [Yehovah has helped] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] Pekach [opened] the son of Remalyahu [protected by Yehovah] began to reign over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in Shomron [watch mountain], [and reigned] twenty years."
2 Kings,15,28,"And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : he departed not from the sins of Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , who made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin."
2 Kings,15,29,"In the days of Pekach [opened] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came Tiglat-Pil’eser [you will uncover the wonderful bond] king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , and took ‘Iyon [a ruin] , and Avel-Beit-Ma’akhah [meadow of the house of oppression] , and Yanoach [He rests] , and Kedesh [Holy Place] , and Hatzor [Castle] , and Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , and Galil [circuit, district] , all the land of Naftali [My Wrestling] , and carried them captive to Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known)))."
2 Kings,15,30,"And Hoshea [salvation] the son of Elah [an oak] made a conspiracy against Pekach [opened] the son of Remalyahu [protected by Yehovah] , and struck him, and killed him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] the son of ‘Uziyah [my strength is Yehovah]."
2 Kings,15,31,"And the rest of the acts of Pekach [opened] , and all that he did, behold, they [are] written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,15,32,In the second year of Pekach [opened] the son of Remalyahu [protected by Yehovah] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] began Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] the son of ‘Uziyah [my strength is Yehovah] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] to reign.
2 Kings,15,33,"Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And his mother’s name [was] Yerusha [dispossessor] , the daughter of Tzadok [righteous]."
2 Kings,15,34,And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : he did according to all that his father ‘Uziyah [my strength is Yehovah] had done.
2 Kings,15,35,However the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
2 Kings,15,36,"Now the rest of the acts of Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] , and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]?"
2 Kings,15,37,"In those days the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) began to send against Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] Retzin [firm] the king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] , and Pekach [opened] the son of Remalyahu [protected by Yehovah]."
2 Kings,15,38,"And Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David [beloved] his father: and Achaz [he has grasped] his son reigned in his stead."
2 Kings,16,1,In the seventeenth year of Pekach [opened] the son of Remalyahu [protected by Yehovah] Achaz [he has grasped] the son of Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] began to reign.
2 Kings,16,2,"Twenty years old [was] Achaz [he has grasped] when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and did not [that which was] right in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , like David [beloved] his father."
2 Kings,16,3,"But he walked in the way of the kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , not only this but even made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) cast out from before the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,16,4,"And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree."
2 Kings,16,5,"Then Retzin [firm] king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] and Pekach [opened] son of Remalyahu [protected by Yehovah] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to war: and they besieged Achaz [he has grasped] , but could not overcome [him]."
2 Kings,16,6,"At that time Retzin [firm] king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] recovered Eilat [Grove of Lofty Trees] to Aram (Syria) [exalted] , and drove the Y’hudim (Judeans) from Eilat [Grove of Lofty Trees] : and the Aram [Syrians] came to Eilat [Grove of Lofty Trees] , and dwelt there unto this day."
2 Kings,16,7,"So Achaz [he has grasped] sent messengers to Tiglat-Pil’eser [you will uncover the wonderful bond] king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , saying, I [am] your i servant and your i son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Aram (Syria) [exalted] , and out of the hand of the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which rise up against me."
2 Kings,16,8,"And Achaz [he has grasped] took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and in the treasures of the king’s house, and sent [it for] a present to the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known)))."
2 Kings,16,9,"And the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) listened unto him: for the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) went up against Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] , and took it, and carried [the people of] it captive to Kir [wall] , and killed Retzin [firm]."
2 Kings,16,10,"And king Achaz [he has grasped] went to Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] to meet Tiglat-Pil’eser [you will uncover the wonderful bond] king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , and saw an altar that [was] at Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] : and king Achaz [he has grasped] sent to Uriyah [Yehovah is my flame] the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof."
2 Kings,16,11,And Uriyah [Yehovah is my flame] the priest built an altar according to all that king Achaz [he has grasped] had sent from Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] : so Uriyah [Yehovah is my flame] the priest made [it] against king Achaz [he has grasped] came from Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver].
2 Kings,16,12,"And when the king was come from Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] , the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon."
2 Kings,16,13,"And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar."
2 Kings,16,14,"And he brought also the brazen altar, which [was] before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and put it on the north side of the altar."
2 Kings,16,15,"And king Achaz [he has grasped] commanded Uriyah [Yehovah is my flame] the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king’s burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brazen altar shall be for me to enquire [by]."
2 Kings,16,16,"Thus did Uriyah [Yehovah is my flame] the priest, according to all that king Achaz [he has grasped] commanded."
2 Kings,16,17,"And king Achaz [he has grasped] cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the Wash basin from off them; and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that [were] under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones."
2 Kings,16,18,"And the colonnade for the Shabbat [Rest] that they had built in the house, and the king’s entry without, turned he from the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) for the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known)))."
2 Kings,16,19,"Now the rest of the acts of Achaz [he has grasped] which he did, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]?"
2 Kings,16,20,"And Achaz [he has grasped] slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David [beloved] : and Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] his son reigned in his stead."
2 Kings,17,1,In the twelfth year of Achaz [he has grasped] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] began Hoshea [salvation] the son of Elah [an oak] to reign in Shomron [watch mountain] over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] nine years.
2 Kings,17,2,"And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , but not as the kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that were before him."
2 Kings,17,3,"Against him came up Shalman’eser [fire-worshipper] [fire-worshipper] king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) ; and Hoshea [salvation] became his servant, and gave him presents."
2 Kings,17,4,"And the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) found conspiracy in Hoshea [salvation] : for he had sent messengers to So [concealed] king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and brought no present to the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , as [he had done] year by year: therefore the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) shut him up, and bound him in prison."
2 Kings,17,5,"Then the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) came up throughout all the land, and went up to Shomron [watch mountain] , and besieged it three years."
2 Kings,17,6,"In the ninth year of Hoshea [salvation] the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) took Shomron [watch mountain] , and carried Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] away into Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , and placed them in Halach [painful] and in Havor [joining] [by] the river of Gozan [a cutting off] , and in the cities of the Medes [middle land]."
2 Kings,17,7,"For [so] it was, that the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] had sinned against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which had brought them up out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , from under the hand of Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and had feared other gods,"
2 Kings,17,8,"And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) cast out from before the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and of the kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which they had made."
2 Kings,17,9,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did secretly [those] things that [were] not right against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city."
2 Kings,17,10,"And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:"
2 Kings,17,11,"And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as [did] the heathen whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to anger:"
2 Kings,17,12,"For they served idols, whereof the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had said unto them, You 2f shall not do this thing."
2 Kings,17,13,"Yet the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) testified against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and against Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , by all the prophets, [and by] all the seers, saying, Turn you 2f from your evil ways, and keep my commandments [and] my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets."
2 Kings,17,14,"Yet they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
2 Kings,17,15,"And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that [were] round about them, [concerning] whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had charged them, that they should not do like them."
2 Kings,17,16,"And they left all the commandments of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and made them molten images, [even] two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the army of heaven, and served Ba’al [lord (a false god)]."
2 Kings,17,17,"And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to provoke him to anger."
2 Kings,17,18,"Therefore the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was very angry with Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] only."
2 Kings,17,19,"Also Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] kept not the commandments of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , but walked in the statutes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] which they made."
2 Kings,17,20,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) rejected all the seed of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight."
2 Kings,17,21,"For he rent Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] from the house of David [beloved] ; and they made Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] king: and Yarov’am [the people will contend] drove Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] from following the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and made them sin a great sin."
2 Kings,17,22,For the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] walked in all the sins of Yarov’am [the people will contend] which he did; they departed not from them;
2 Kings,17,23,"Until the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) removed Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] carried away out of their own land to Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) unto this day."
2 Kings,17,24,"And the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) brought [men] from Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and from Kutah [crushing] , and from ‘Ava [ruin] , and from Hamat [Fortress] , and from S’farvayim [the two Sipparas (the city of books)] , and placed [them] in the cities of Shomron [watch mountain] instead of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and they possessed Shomron [watch mountain] , and dwelt in the cities thereof."
2 Kings,17,25,"And [so] it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, [that] they feared not the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : therefore the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent lions among them, which killed [some] of them."
2 Kings,17,26,"For what reason they spoke to the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , saying, The nations which you i have removed, and placed in the cities of Shomron [watch mountain] , know not the manner of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of the land: therefore he has sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of the land."
2 Kings,17,27,"Then the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) commanded, saying, Carry there one of the priests whom you 2f brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of the land."
2 Kings,17,28,"Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Shomron [watch mountain] came and dwelt in Beit-El [House of God] , and taught them how they should fear the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,17,29,"However every nation made gods of their own, and put [them] in the houses of the high places which the Shomronim [of Samaria (the watch-mountain)] had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt."
2 Kings,17,30,"And the men of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] made Sukkot-B’not [the daughter’s booth] , and the men of Kutah [crushing] made Nergal [hero] , and the men of Hamat [Fortress] made Ashima [guiltiness: I will make desolate],"
2 Kings,17,31,"And the ‘Avim [Ruins] made Nivchaz [the barker] and Tartak [prince of darkness] , and the S’farvim [enumeration] burnt their children in fire to Adramelekh [honor of the king, or Adar is prince] and Adramelekh [image of the king] , the gods of S’farvayim [the two Sipparas (the city of books)]."
2 Kings,17,32,"So they feared the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places."
2 Kings,17,33,"They feared the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from there."
2 Kings,17,34,"Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded the children of Ya’akov [Heal of God] , whom he named Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God];"
2 Kings,17,35,"With whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, You 2f shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:"
2 Kings,17,36,"But the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , who brought you up out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall you 2f fear, and him shall you 2f worship, and to him shall you 2f do sacrifice."
2 Kings,17,37,"And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you 2f shall observe to do forevermore; and you 2f shall not fear other gods."
2 Kings,17,38,And the covenant that I have made with you you 2f shall not forget; neither shall you 2f fear other gods.
2 Kings,17,39,But the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] you 2f shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
2 Kings,17,40,"However they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner."
2 Kings,17,41,"So these nations feared the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and served their graven images, both their children, and their children’s children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day."
2 Kings,18,1,"Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea [salvation] son of Elah [an oak] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [that] Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] the son of Achaz [he has grasped] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] began to reign."
2 Kings,18,2,"Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . His mother’s name also [was] Avi [my father] , the daughter of Z’kharyah [Yehovah remembers] [the Lord recalled]."
2 Kings,18,3,"And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , according to all that David [beloved] his father did."
2 Kings,18,4,"He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the groves, and broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] had made: for unto those days the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did burn incense to it: and he called it N’chushtan [the bronze]."
2 Kings,18,5,"He trusted in the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , nor [any] that were before him."
2 Kings,18,6,"For he clave to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [and] departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
2 Kings,18,7,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was with him; [and] he prospered to wherever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , and served him not."
2 Kings,18,8,"He struck the P’lishtim [Immigrants], [even] unto ‘Azah [The Strong] , and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city."
2 Kings,18,9,"And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] , which [was] the seventh year of Hoshea [salvation] son of Elah [an oak] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [that] Shalman’eser [fire-worshipper] [fire-worshipper] king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) came up against Shomron [watch mountain] , and besieged it."
2 Kings,18,10,"And at the end of three years they took it: [even] in the sixth year of Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] , that [is] the ninth year of Hoshea [salvation] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Shomron [watch mountain] was taken."
2 Kings,18,11,"And the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) did carry away Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] unto Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , and put them in Halach [painful] and in Havor [joining] [by] the river of Gozan [a cutting off] , and in the cities of the Medes [middle land]:"
2 Kings,18,12,"Because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , but transgressed his covenant, [and] all that Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] the servant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded, and would not hear [them] , nor do [them]."
2 Kings,18,13,"Now in the fourteenth year of king Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] did Sancheriv [Sin (the moon) multiplied brothers] king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) come up against all the fenced cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and took them."
2 Kings,18,14,"And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] sent to the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) to Lakhish [Invincible] , saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you i put on me will I bear. And the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) appointed unto Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold."
2 Kings,18,15,"And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] gave [him] all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and in the treasures of the king’s house."
2 Kings,18,16,"At that time did Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] cut off [the gold from] the doors of the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and [from] the pillars which Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known)))."
2 Kings,18,17,"And the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) sent Tartan [general] and Rav-Saris [chief eunuch] and Rav-Shakeh [chief cupbearer] from Lakhish [Invincible] to king Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] with a great host against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And they went up and came to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which [is] in the highway of the Launderers’ Field."
2 Kings,18,18,"And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Elyakim [God sets up] the son of Hilkiyahu [my portion is Yehovah] , which [was] over the household, and Shevnah [vigour] the scribe, and Yo’ach [Yahovah is brother] the son of Asaf [gatherer] the recorder."
2 Kings,18,19,"And Rav-Shakeh [chief cupbearer] said unto them, Speak you 2f now to Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] , Thus says the great king, the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , What confidence [is] this wherein you i?"
2 Kings,18,20,"You i say, (but [they are but] vain words,) [I have] counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom do you i trust, that you i rebel against me?"
2 Kings,18,21,"Now, behold, you i trust upon the staff of this bruised reed, [even] upon Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so [is] Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] unto all that trust on him."
2 Kings,18,22,"But if you 2f say unto me, We trust in the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]: [is] not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] has taken away, and has said to Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , You 2f shall worship before this altar in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]?"
2 Kings,18,23,"Now therefore, I pray you i , give pledges to my lord the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , and I will deliver you i two thousand horses, if you i be able on your i part to set riders upon them."
2 Kings,18,24,"How then will you i turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your i trust on Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] for chariots and for horsemen?"
2 Kings,18,25,"Am I now come up without the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) against this place to destroy it? The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it."
2 Kings,18,26,"Then said Elyakim [God sets up] the son of Hilkiyahu [my portion is Yehovah] , and Shevnah [vigour] , and Yo’ach [Yahovah is brother] , unto Rav-Shakeh [chief cupbearer] , Speak, I pray you i , to your i servants in the Arami [exalted] language; for we understand [it] : and talk not with us in the Y’hudit (Y’hudim (Judeans)’) language in the ears of the people that [are] on the wall."
2 Kings,18,27,"But Rav-Shakeh [chief cupbearer] said unto them, Has my master sent me to you i master, and to you i , to speak these words? [has he] not [sent me] to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?"
2 Kings,18,28,"Then Rav-Shakeh [chief cupbearer] stood and cried with a loud voice in the Y’hudit (Y’hudim (Judeans)’) language, and spoke, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))):"
2 Kings,18,29,"Thus says the king, Let not Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:"
2 Kings,18,30,"Neither let Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] make you trust in the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known)))."
2 Kings,18,31,"Listen not to Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] : for thus says the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , Make [an agreement] with me by a present, and come out to me, and [then] eat you 2f every man of his own vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and drink you 2f everyone the waters of his cistern:"
2 Kings,18,32,"Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that you 2f may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] , when he persuades you, saying, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will deliver us."
2 Kings,18,33,"Has any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known)))?"
2 Kings,18,34,"Where [are] the gods of Hamat [Fortress] , and of Arpad [I shall be spread out (or supported)] ? where [are] the gods of S’farvayim [the two Sipparas (the city of books)] , Hena [troubling] , and ‘Ivah [ruin] ? have they delivered Shomron [watch mountain] out of my hand?"
2 Kings,18,35,"Who [are] they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) should deliver Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] out of my hand?"
2 Kings,18,36,"But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not."
2 Kings,18,37,"Then came Elyakim [God sets up] the son of Hilkiyahu [my portion is Yehovah] , which [was] over the household, and Shevnah [vigour] the scribe, and Yo’ach [Yahovah is brother] the son of Asaf [gatherer] the recorder, to Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] with [their] clothes rent, and told him the words of Rav-Shakeh [chief cupbearer]."
2 Kings,19,1,"And it came to pass, when king Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] heard [it] , that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,19,2,"And he sent Elyakim [God sets up] , which [was] over the household, and Shevnah [vigour] the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Yesha’yahu [Yehovah has saved] the prophet the son of Amotz [strong]."
2 Kings,19,3,"And they said unto him, Thus says Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] , This day [is] a day of trouble, and of rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) , and blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and [there is] not strength to bring forth."
2 Kings,19,4,"It may be the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] will hear all the words of Rav-Shakeh [chief cupbearer] , whom the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) his master has sent to reproach (disgrace; shame) the living God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; and will reprove the words which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has heard: wherefore lift up [your i ] prayer for the remnant that are left."
2 Kings,19,5,So the servants of king Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] came to Yesha’yahu [Yehovah has saved].
2 Kings,19,6,"And Yesha’yahu [Yehovah has saved] said unto them, Thus shall you 2f say to your master, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Be not afraid of the words which you i have heard, with which the servants of the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) have blasphemed me."
2 Kings,19,7,"Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land."
2 Kings,19,8,"So Rav-Shakeh [chief cupbearer] returned, and found the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) warring against Livnah [Pavement] : for he had heard that he was departed from Lakhish [Invincible]."
2 Kings,19,9,"And when he heard say of Tirhakah [he searched out the pious] king of Ethiopia [Kush] , Behold, he is come out to fight against you i : he sent messengers again unto Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] , saying,"
2 Kings,19,10,"Thus shall you 2f speak to Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , saying, Let not your i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in whom you i trust deceive you i , saying, Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known)))."
2 Kings,19,11,"Behold, you i have heard what the kings of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shall you i be delivered?"
2 Kings,19,12,"Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; [as] Gozan [a cutting off] , and Haran [mountaineer] , and Retzef [a hot stone] , and the children of ‘Eden which [were] in Tel’asar [Ashur (Assyrian) hill]?"
2 Kings,19,13,"Where [is] the king of Hamat [Fortress] , and the king of Arpad [I shall be spread out (or supported)] , and the king of the city of S’farvayim [the two Sipparas (the city of books)] , of Hena [troubling] , and ‘Ivah [ruin]?"
2 Kings,19,14,"And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] went up into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and spread it before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,19,15,"And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] prayed before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which dwell [between] the k’vurim (cherubim) , you i are the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered], [even] you i alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you i have made heaven and earth."
2 Kings,19,16,"Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , bow down your i ear, and hear: open, Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , your i eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sancheriv [Sin (the moon) multiplied brothers] , which has sent him to reproach (disgrace; shame) the living God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
2 Kings,19,17,"Of a truth, Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the kings of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) have destroyed the nations and their lands,"
2 Kings,19,18,"And have cast their gods into the fire: for they [were] no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them."
2 Kings,19,19,"Now therefore, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , save you i us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you i [are] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered], [even] you i only."
2 Kings,19,20,"Then Yesha’yahu [Yehovah has saved] the son of Amotz [strong] sent to Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] , saying, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [That] which you i have prayed to me against Sancheriv [Sin (the moon) multiplied brothers] king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) I have heard."
2 Kings,19,21,"This [is] the word that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Tziyon [parched place] has despised you i, [and] laughed you i to scorn; the daughter of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] has shaken her head at you i."
2 Kings,19,22,"Whom have you i reproached and blasphemed? and against whom have you i exalted [your i ] voice, and lifted up your i eyes on high? [even] against the Holy [One] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,19,23,"By your i messengers you i have reproached the Lord-Adonai (The Father) [Greatest Above All Things] , and have said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of L’vanon [Whiteness] , and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, [and] the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, [and into] the forest of his Carmel [Garden-land]."
2 Kings,19,24,"I have excavated and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places."
2 Kings,19,25,"Have you i not heard long ago [how] I have done it, [and] of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that you i should be to lay waste fenced cities [into] ruinous heaps."
2 Kings,19,26,"Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were [as] the grass of the field, and [as] the green herb, [as] the grass on the housetops, and [as corn] blasted before it be grown up."
2 Kings,19,27,"But I know your i abode, and your i going out, and your i coming in, and your i rage against me."
2 Kings,19,28,"Because you i rage against me and your i tumult is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your i nose, and my bridle in your i lips, and I will turn you i back by the way by which you i came."
2 Kings,19,29,"And this [shall be] a sign unto you i , You 2f shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow you 2f , and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof."
2 Kings,19,30,"And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward."
2 Kings,19,31,"For out of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Tziyon [parched place] : the zeal of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies]] shall do this."
2 Kings,19,32,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) concerning the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it."
2 Kings,19,33,"By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,19,34,"For I will defend this city, to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David’s [beloved] ’s sake."
2 Kings,19,35,"And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) went out, and struck in the camp of the children of Ashur an hundred eighty and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they [were] all dead corpses."
2 Kings,19,36,"So Sancheriv [Sin (the moon) multiplied brothers] king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh [abode of Ninus, or Offspring’s Habitation]."
2 Kings,19,37,"And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisrokh [the great eagle] his god, that Adramelekh [honor of the king, or Adar is prince] and Shar’etzer [prince of fire] his sons struck him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat [the curse reversed] [the curse reversed: precipitation of curse] . And Esar-Hadon [Ashur has given a brother] his son reigned in his stead."
2 Kings,20,1,"In those days was Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] sick unto death. And the prophet Yesha’yahu [Yehovah has saved] the son of Amotz [strong] came to him, and said unto him, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Set your i house in order; for you i shall die, and not live."
2 Kings,20,2,"Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying,"
2 Kings,20,3,"I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , remember now how I have walked before you i in tand with a perfect heart, and have done [that which is] good in your i sight. And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] wept bitterly."
2 Kings,20,4,"And it came to pass, afore Yesha’yahu [Yehovah has saved] was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came to him, saying,"
2 Kings,20,5,"Turn again, and tell Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] the captain of my people, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of David [beloved] your i father, I have heard your i prayer, I have seen your i tears: behold, I will heal you i : on the third day you i shall go up unto the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,20,6,"And I will add unto your i days fifteen years; and I will deliver you i and this city out of the hand of the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) ; and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David’s [beloved] ’s sake."
2 Kings,20,7,"And Yesha’yahu [Yehovah has saved] said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid [it] on the boil (inflammation) , and he recovered."
2 Kings,20,8,"And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] said unto Yesha’yahu [Yehovah has saved] , What [shall be] the sign that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) the third day?"
2 Kings,20,9,"And Yesha’yahu [Yehovah has saved] said, This sign shall you i have of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will do the thing that he has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?"
2 Kings,20,10,"And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: No, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees."
2 Kings,20,11,"And Yesha’yahu [Yehovah has saved] the prophet cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and He brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the sundial of Achaz [he has grasped]."
2 Kings,20,12,"At that time B’rodakh-Bal’adan [worshipper of Bel (lord)] , the son of Bal’adan [Bel is lord] , king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , sent letters and a present unto Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] : for he had heard that Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] had been sick."
2 Kings,20,13,"And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] listened unto them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and [all] the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] showed them not."
2 Kings,20,14,"Then came Yesha’yahu [Yehovah has saved] the prophet unto king Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] , and said unto him, What said these men? and from what place came they unto you i ? And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] said, They are come from a far country, [even] from Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
2 Kings,20,15,"And he said, What have they seen in your i house? And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] answered, All [the things] that [are] in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them."
2 Kings,20,16,"And Yesha’yahu [Yehovah has saved] said unto Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] , Hear the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,20,17,"Behold, the days come, that all that [is] in your i house, and that which your i fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] : nothing shall be left, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,20,18,"And of your i sons that shall issue (what comes forth) from you i , which you i shall beget (to be father of; be ancestor of) , shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
2 Kings,20,19,"Then said Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] unto Yesha’yahu [Yehovah has saved] , Good [is] the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) which you i have spoken. And he said, [Is it] not [good] , if peace and tbe in my days?"
2 Kings,20,20,"And the rest of the acts of Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] , and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]?"
2 Kings,20,21,And Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] slept with his fathers: and M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings,21,1,"M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] [was] twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And his mother’s name [was] Heftzibah [my delight is in her]."
2 Kings,21,2,"And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , after the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) cast out before the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
2 Kings,21,3,"For he built up again the high places which Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , and made a Ashera (consort of Ba’al) , as did Ach’av [father’s brother] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and worshipped all the army of heaven, and served them."
2 Kings,21,4,"And he built altars in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , of which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, In Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] will I put my name."
2 Kings,21,5,And he built altars for all the army of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
2 Kings,21,6,"And he made his son pass through the fire (as a sacrifice) , and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards (he practiced soothsaying and divination and appointed mediums and persons who used spirit guides) : he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to provoke [him] to anger."
2 Kings,21,7,"And he set a graven image of the Asherah (consort of Ba’al) that he had made in the house, of which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said to David [beloved] , and to Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] his son, In this house, and in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , which I have chosen out of all tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , will I put my name forever:"
2 Kings,21,8,"Neither will I make the feet of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] commanded them."
2 Kings,21,9,But they listened not: and M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) destroyed before the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
2 Kings,21,10,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,"
2 Kings,21,11,"Because M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] has done these abominations, [and] has done wickedly above all that the Emori [Highlanders] did, which [were] before him, and has made Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] also to sin with his idols:"
2 Kings,21,12,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Behold, I [am] bringing [such] evil upon Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , that whosoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle."
2 Kings,21,13,"And I will stretch over Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] the line of Shomron [watch mountain] , and the plummet of the house of Ach’av [father’s brother] : and I will wipe Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] as [a man] wipes a dish, wiping [it] , and turning [it] upside down."
2 Kings,21,14,"And I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil (plunder; prey; booty) to all their enemies;"
2 Kings,21,15,"Because they have done [that which was] evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , even unto this day."
2 Kings,21,16,"Moreover M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] shed so much innocent blood, that he had filled Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] from one end to another; beside his sin which he made Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] to sin, in doing [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,21,17,"Now the rest of the acts of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]?"
2 Kings,21,18,"And M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of ‘Uza [strength] : and ‘Amon [master workman] his son reigned in his stead."
2 Kings,21,19,"‘Amon [master workman] [was] twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And his mother’s name [was] Meshulemet [friend] , the daughter of Harutz [zealous] of Yotvah [pleasing]."
2 Kings,21,20,"And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , as his father M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] did."
2 Kings,21,21,"And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:"
2 Kings,21,22,"And he forsook the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,21,23,"And the servants of ‘Amon [master workman] conspired against him, and killed the king in his own house."
2 Kings,21,24,And the people of the land killed all them that had conspired against king ‘Amon [master workman] ; and the people of the land made Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] his son king in his stead.
2 Kings,21,25,"Now the rest of the acts of ‘Amon [master workman] which he did, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]?"
2 Kings,21,26,And he was buried in his sepulcher in the garden of ‘Uza [strength] : and Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings,22,1,"Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] [was] eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And his mother’s name [was] Y’didah [beloved] , the daughter of ‘Adayah [Yehovah has adorned Himself] of Botzkat [rocky height]."
2 Kings,22,2,"And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and walked in all the way of David [beloved] his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left."
2 Kings,22,3,"And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals], [that] the king sent Shafan [coney] the son of Atzalyahu [Yehovah has set apart] , the son of Meshulam [friend] , the scribe, to the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying,"
2 Kings,22,4,"Go up to Hilkiyahu [my portion is Yehovah] the High Priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:"
2 Kings,22,5,"And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and let them give it to the doers of the work which [is] in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to repair the breaches of the house,"
2 Kings,22,6,"Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and cut stone to repair the house."
2 Kings,22,7,"However there was no accounting made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully."
2 Kings,22,8,"And Hilkiyahu [my portion is Yehovah] the High Priest said unto Shafan [coney] the scribe, I have found the book of the Torah in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . And Hilkiyahu [my portion is Yehovah] gave the book to Shafan [coney] , and he read it."
2 Kings,22,9,"And Shafan [coney] the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Your 1s servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,22,10,"And Shafan [coney] the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiyahu [my portion is Yehovah] the priest has delivered me a book. And Shafan [coney] read it before the king."
2 Kings,22,11,"And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes."
2 Kings,22,12,"And the king commanded Hilkiyahu [my portion is Yehovah] the priest, and Achikam [my brother has arisen] the son of Shafan [coney] , and ‘Akhbor [mouse] the son of Mikhayah [who is like God?] , and Shafan [coney] the scribe, and ‘Asayah [made by Yehovah] a servant of the king’s, saying,"
2 Kings,22,13,"Go you 2f , enquire of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) for me, and for the people, and for all Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , concerning the words of this book that is found: for great [is] the wrath of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not listened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us."
2 Kings,22,14,"So Hilkiyahu [my portion is Yehovah] the priest, and Achikam [my brother has arisen] , and ‘Akhbor [mouse] , and Shafan [coney] , and ‘Asayah [made by Yehovah] , went unto Huldah [weasel] the prophetess, the wife of Shalum [retribution] the son of Tikvah [hope] , the son of Harchas [very poor] , keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] in the college;) and they communed with her."
2 Kings,22,15,"And she said unto them, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Tell the man that sent you to me,"
2 Kings,22,16,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, [even] all the words of the book which the king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] has read:"
2 Kings,22,17,"Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched."
2 Kings,22,18,"But to the king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] which sent you to enquire of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , thus shall you 2f say to him, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [As touching] the words which you i have heard;"
2 Kings,22,19,"Because your i heart was tender, and you i have humbled yourself before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , when you i heard what I spoke against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have rent your i clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard [you i ] , says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,22,20,"Behold therefore, I will gather you i unto your i fathers, and you i shall be gathered into your i grave in peace; and your i eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again."
2 Kings,23,1,"And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Kings,23,2,"And the king went up into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and all the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the Book of the Covenant which was found in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,23,3,"And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to walk after the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all [their] heart and all [their] soul, to perform the words of this Covenant that were written in this Book. And all the people pledged [themselves] to the covenant."
2 Kings,23,4,"And the king commanded Hilkiyahu [my portion is Yehovah] the High Priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) all the vessels that were made for Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , and for the Asherah [consort of Ba’al] , and for all the army of heaven: and he burned them outside Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] in the fields of Kidron [dark] , and carried the ashes of them unto Beit-El [House of God]."
2 Kings,23,5,"And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and in the places round about Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; them also that burned incense unto Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the army of heaven."
2 Kings,23,6,"And he brought out the Asherah from the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , without Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , unto the river Kidron [dark] , and burned it at the river Kidron [dark] , and stamped [it] small to (to do entirely, do wholly) powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people."
2 Kings,23,7,"And he broke down the houses of the sodomites (cult prostitutes) , that [were] by the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , where the women wove hangings for the Asherah."
2 Kings,23,8,"And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geva [hill] to Be’er-sheva [Well of the sevenfold Oath] , and broke down the high places of the gates that [were] in the entering in of the gate of Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the governor of the city, which [were] on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city."
2 Kings,23,9,"Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren."
2 Kings,23,10,"And he defiled Tofet [place of fire] , which [is] in the valley of the children of Hinnom [Lamentation] , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire (as a sacrifice) to Molekh [king]."
2 Kings,23,11,"And he took away the horses that the kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , by the chamber of N’tan-Melekh [the gift of the king] the Chamberlain (eunuch or chief servant; one in charge of the king’s quarters) , which [was] in the side-courtyard, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire."
2 Kings,23,12,"And the altars that [were] on the top of the upper chamber of Achaz [he has grasped] , which the kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] had made, and the altars which M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , did the king beat down, and broke [them] down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron [dark]."
2 Kings,23,13,"And the high places that [were] before Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , which [were] on the right hand of the Mount of Destruction, which Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] the king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] had built for ‘Ashtoret [star] the abomination of the people of Tzidon [Hunting] , and for K’mosh [Subduer] the abomination of the Mo’avi [of his father] , and for Milkom [great king] the abomination of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , did the king defile."
2 Kings,23,14,"And he broke in pieces the images, and cut down the Asherah [consort of Ba’al] , and filled their places with the bones of men."
2 Kings,23,15,"Moreover the altar that [was] at Beit-El [House of God], [and] the high place which Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of N’vat [aspect] , who made Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, [and] stamped [it] small to (to do entirely, do wholly) powder, and burned the Asherah."
2 Kings,23,16,"And as Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] turned himself, he spied the sepulchers that [were] there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned [them] upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) which the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] proclaimed, who proclaimed these words."
2 Kings,23,17,"Then he said, What monument [is] that that I see? And the men of the city told him, [It is] the sepulcher of the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which came from Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and proclaimed these things that you i have done against the altar of Beit-El [House of God]."
2 Kings,23,18,"And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Shomron [watch mountain]."
2 Kings,23,19,"And all the houses also of the high places that [were] in the cities of Shomron [watch mountain] , which the kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] had made to provoke [the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)] to anger, Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beit-El [House of God]."
2 Kings,23,20,"And he killed all the priests of the high places that [were] there upon the altars, and burned men’s bones upon them, and returned to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Kings,23,21,"And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the Passover the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , as [it is] written in the Book of this Covenant."
2 Kings,23,22,"Surely there was not held such a Passover from the days of the that judged Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , nor in all the days of the kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , nor of the kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised];"
2 Kings,23,23,"But in the eighteenth year of king Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals], [in it] this Passover was held to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Kings,23,24,"Moreover the [workers with] familiar spirits (spirit guides) , and the wizards, and the images (household gods) , and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , did Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the Book that Hilkiyahu [my portion is Yehovah] the priest found in the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
2 Kings,23,25,"And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] ; neither after him arose there [any] like him."
2 Kings,23,26,"Yet the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, which his anger was kindled against Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , because of all the provocations that M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] had provoked him with it all."
2 Kings,23,27,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, I will remove Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] also out of my sight, as I have removed Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and will cast off this city Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there."
2 Kings,23,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] , and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]?"
2 Kings,23,29,"In his days Pharaoh N’khoh [great house-he is smitten] king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] went up against the king of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) to the river Euphrates (to break forth, to gush) : and king Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] went against him; and he killed him at Megiddo [Place of Crowds] , when he had seen him."
2 Kings,23,30,"And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo [Place of Crowds] , and brought him to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and buried him in his own sepulcher. And the people of the land took Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] the son of Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] , and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s stead."
2 Kings,23,31,"Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] [was] twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And his mother’s name [was] Hamuta [father-in-law is protection] , the daughter of Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] of Livnah [Pavement]."
2 Kings,23,32,"And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , according to all that his fathers had done."
2 Kings,23,33,"And Pharaoh N’khoh [great house-he is smitten] put him in bands at Rivlah [Fertility] in the land of Hamat [Fortress] , that he might not reign in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a sixty-six tons of gold."
2 Kings,23,34,"And Pharaoh N’khoh [great house-he is smitten] made Elyakim [God sets up] the son of Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] king in the room of Yoshiyahu [whom Yehovah heals] his father, and turned his name to Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] , and took Y’ho’achaz [Yehovah has seized] away: and he came to Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and died there."
2 Kings,23,35,"And Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] gave the silver and the gold to Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] ; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] : he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of everyone according to his taxation, to give [it] unto Pharaoh N’khoh [great house-he is smitten]."
2 Kings,23,36,"Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] [was] twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And his mother’s name [was] Z’vudah [given] , the daughter of P’dayah [Yehovah has ransomed] of Rumah [height]."
2 Kings,23,37,"And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , according to all that his fathers had done."
2 Kings,24,1,"In his days N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] came up, and Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him."
2 Kings,24,2,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent against him bands (raiding parties) of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] , and bands of the Aram [Syrians] , and bands of the Mo’avi [of his father] , and bands of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , and sent them against Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] to destroy it, according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he spoke by his servants the prophets."
2 Kings,24,3,"Surely at the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came [this] upon Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , to remove [them] out of his sight, for the sins of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , according to all that he did;"
2 Kings,24,4,And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] with innocent blood; which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) would not pardon.
2 Kings,24,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] , and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]?"
2 Kings,24,6,So Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] slept with his fathers: and Y’hoyakhin [Yehovah establishes] his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings,24,7,"And the king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] had taken from the river of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] unto the river Euphrates (to break forth, to gush) all that pertained to the king of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
2 Kings,24,8,"Y’hoyakhin [Yehovah establishes] [was] eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] three months. And his mother’s name [was] N’chushta [brass] , the daughter of Elnatan [God has given] of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
2 Kings,24,9,"And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , according to all that his father had done."
2 Kings,24,10,"At that time the servants of N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] came up against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and the city was besieged."
2 Kings,24,11,"And N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] came against the city, and his servants did besiege it."
2 Kings,24,12,"And Y’hoyakhin [Yehovah establishes] the king of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] went out to the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] took him in the eighth year of his reign."
2 Kings,24,13,"And he carried out from there all the treasures of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Shlomo (Solomon) [peace] king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] had made in the temple of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had said."
2 Kings,24,14,"And he carried away all Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, [even] ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest of the people of the land."
2 Kings,24,15,"And he carried away Y’hoyakhin [Yehovah establishes] to Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , and the king’s mother, and the king’s wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, [those] carried he into captivity from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
2 Kings,24,16,"And all the men of might, [even] seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all [that were] strong [and] trained for war, even them the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] brought captive to Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
2 Kings,24,17,"And the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] made Matanyah [gift of Yehovah] his father’s brother king in his place, and changed his name to Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous]."
2 Kings,24,18,"Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] [was] twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] . And his mother’s name [was] Hamuta [father-in-law is protection] , the daughter of Yirmeyahu [whom Yehovah has appointed] of Livnah [Pavement]."
2 Kings,24,19,"And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , according to all that Y’hoyakim [Yehovah raises up] had done."
2 Kings,24,20,"Because through the anger of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) it came to pass in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , until he had cast them out from his presence, that Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous] rebelled against the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion]."
2 Kings,25,1,"And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, [that] N’vukhadnetzar [May Nebo protect the crown] king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] came, he, and all his host, against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about."
2 Kings,25,2,And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Tzidkiyah [Yehovah is righteous].
2 Kings,25,3,"And on the ninth [day] of the [fourth] month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land."
2 Kings,25,4,"And the city was broken in to, and all the men of war [fled] by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which [is] by the king’s garden (now the Kasdim [clod-breakers] [were] against the city round about) and [the king] went the way toward the ‘Aravah [plain]."
2 Kings,25,5,"And the army of the Kasdim [clod-breakers] pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Yericho [Its Moon] : and all his army were deserted from him."
2 Kings,25,6,"So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] to Rivlah [Fertility] ; and they passed judgment upon him."
