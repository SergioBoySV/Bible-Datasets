Judges,1,1,"Now after the death of Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] it came to pass, that the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] asked the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, Who shall go up for us against the Kena’ani [Merchant] first, to fight against them?"
Judges,1,2,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand."
Judges,1,3,"And Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] said unto Shim’on [he who hears] his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Kena’ani [Merchant] ; and I likewise will go with you i into you i lot. So Shim’on [he who hears] went with him."
Judges,1,4,And Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] went up; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) delivered the Kena’ani [Merchant] and the P’rizi [Dwellers in Unwalled Towns] into their hand: and they killed of them in Bezek [Lightning] ten thousand men.
Judges,1,5,"And they found Adonis--Bezek [My Lord is Lightning] in Bezek [Lightning] : and they fought against him, and they killed the Kena’ani [Merchant] and the P’rizi [Dwellers in Unwalled Towns]."
Judges,1,6,"But Adonis--Bezek [My Lord is Lightning] fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes."
Judges,1,7,"And Adonis--Bezek [My Lord is Lightning] said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered [their meat] under my table: as I have done, so God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has requited me. And they brought him to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and there he died."
Judges,1,8,"Now the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] had fought against Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire."
Judges,1,9,"And afterward the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] went down to fight against the Kena’ani [Merchant] , that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley."
Judges,1,10,"And Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] went against the Kena’ani [Merchant] that dwelt in Hevron [Seat of Association] : (now the name of Hevron [Seat of Association] before [was] Kiryat-Arba [City of Arba (four)] :) and they killed Sheshai [Noble] , and Achiman [My Brother is a Gift] , and Talmai [Plowman]."
Judges,1,11,And from there he went against the inhabitants of D’vir [Sanctuary] : and the name of D’vir [Sanctuary] before [was] Kiryat-Sepher [City of the Book]:
Judges,1,12,"And Kalev [Dog] said, He that smites Kiryat-Sepher [City of the Book] , and takes it, to him will I give ‘Akhsah [Anklet] my daughter to wife."
Judges,1,13,"And ‘Otni’el [Lion of God] the son of K’naz [Hunter] , Kalev [Dog] ’s younger brother, took it: and he gave him ‘Akhsah [Anklet] his daughter to wife."
Judges,1,14,"And it came to pass, when she came [to him] , that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off [her] ass; and Kalev [Dog] said unto her, What will you i?"
Judges,1,15,"And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for you i have given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Kalev [Dog] gave her the upper springs and the lower springs."
Judges,1,16,"And the children of the Kayin [Possession] , Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] ’ father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] into the wilderness of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , which [lies] in the south of ‘Arad [A Wild Ass] ; and they went and dwelt among the people."
Judges,1,17,"And Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] went with Shim’on [he who hears] his brother, and they killed the Kena’ani [Merchant] that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah [Asylum]."
Judges,1,18,"Also Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] took ‘Azah [The Strong] with the coast thereof, and Askelon [The Fire of Infamy: I shall be Weighed] with the coast thereof, and ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots] with the coast thereof."
Judges,1,19,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was with Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ; and he drove out [the inhabitants of] the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron."
Judges,1,20,"And they gave Hevron [Seat of Association] unto Kalev [Dog] , as Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said: and he expelled there the three sons of Anak [Neck]."
Judges,1,21,"And the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] did not drive out the Y’vusi [Threshers, Trampled Under Foot] that inhabited Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; but the Y’vusi [Threshers, Trampled Under Foot] dwell with the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] unto this day."
Judges,1,22,"And the house of Yosef [(God) He Shall Add] , they also went up against Beit-El [House of God] : and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [was] with them."
Judges,1,23,And the house of Yosef [ (God) He Shall Add] sent to descry (search out; map out; to describe) Beit-El [House of God] . (Now the name of the city before [was] Luz [Almond Tree] .)
Judges,1,24,"And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray you i , the entrance into the city, and we will show you i mercy."
Judges,1,25,"And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family."
Judges,1,26,"And the man went into the land of the Hitti [Terrorists] , and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz [Almond Tree] : which [is] the name thereof unto this day."
Judges,1,27,"Neither did M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] drive out [the inhabitants of] Beit-Sh’an [House of Ease] and her towns, nor Ta’anakh [Sandy] and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor [Generation] and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Yivle’am [Devouring the People] and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo [Place of Crowds] and her towns: but the Kena’ani [Merchant] would dwell in that land."
Judges,1,28,"And it came to pass, when Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] was strong, that they put the Kena’ani [Merchant] to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out."
Judges,1,29,Neither did Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] drive out the Kena’ani [Merchant] that dwelt in Gezer [Portion] ; but the Kena’ani [Merchant] dwelt in Gezer [Portion] among them.
Judges,1,30,"Neither did Z’vulun [Glorious Dwelling Place] drive out the inhabitants of Kitron [Incense] , nor the inhabitants of Nahalol [Pasture] ; but the Kena’ani [Merchant] dwelt among them, and became tributaries."
Judges,1,31,"Neither did Asher [Happy] drive out the inhabitants of ‘Akko [His Straitness] , nor the inhabitants of Tzidon [Hunting] , nor of Ahlav [Fertile Place] , nor of Achziv [Deceit] , nor of Helbah [Fertile] , nor of Afik [Enclosure] , nor of Rechov [Broad Place]:"
Judges,1,32,"But the Asheri [Happy] dwelt among the Kena’ani [Merchant] , the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out."
Judges,1,33,"Neither did Naftali [My Wrestling] drive out the inhabitants of Beit-Shemesh [House of the Sun] , nor the inhabitants of Beit-’Anat [House of Response (or Affliction)] ; but he dwelt among the Kena’ani [Merchant] , the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beit-Shemesh [House of the Sun] and of Beit-’Anat [House of Response (or Affliction)] became tributaries unto them."
Judges,1,34,And the Emori [Highlanders] forced the children of Dan [Judge] into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:
Judges,1,35,"But the Emori [Highlanders] would dwell in mount Heres [The Sun] in Ayalon [Field of Deer] , and in Sha’alvim [Place of Foxes] : yet the hand of the house of Yosef [ (God) He Shall Add] prevailed, so that they became tributaries."
Judges,1,36,"And the coast of the Emori [Highlanders] [was] from the going up to ‘Akrabbim [Ascent of Scorpions] , from the rock, and upward."
Judges,2,1,"And an angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came up from Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] to Bokhim [Weeping] , and said, I made you to go up out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and have brought you unto the land which I swore unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you."
Judges,2,2,And you 2f shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; you 2f shall throw down their altars: but you 2f have not obeyed my voice: why have you 2f done this?
Judges,2,3,"For what reason I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be [as thorns] in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you."
Judges,2,4,"And it came to pass, when the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke these words unto all the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that the people lifted up their voice, and wept."
Judges,2,5,And they called the name of that place Bokhim [Weeping] : and they sacrificed there unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
Judges,2,6,"And when Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] had let the people go, the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land."
Judges,2,7,"And the people served the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) all the days of Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , and all the days of the elders that outlived Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , who had seen all the great works of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that he did for Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Judges,2,8,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Nun [Posterity] , the servant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , died, [being] an hundred and ten years old."
Judges,2,9,"And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnat-Heres [Portion of the Sun] , in the mount of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , on the north side of the hill Ga’ash [Quaking]."
Judges,2,10,"And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , nor yet the works which he had done for Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Judges,2,11,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and served Ba’alim [lords (false gods)]:"
Judges,2,12,"And they forsook the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that [were] round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to anger."
Judges,2,13,"And they forsook the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and served Ba’al [lord (a false god)] and ‘Ashtarot [Star (female deity)]."
Judges,2,14,"And the anger of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was hot against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies."
Judges,2,15,"Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was against them for evil, as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had said, and as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed."
Judges,2,16,"Nevertheless the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them."
Judges,2,17,"And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate); [but] they did not so."
Judges,2,18,"And when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) raised them up judges, then the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them."
Judges,2,19,"And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, [that] they returned, and corrupted [themselves] more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way."
Judges,2,20,"And the anger of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was hot against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and he said, Because that this people has transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not listened unto my voice;"
Judges,2,21,I also will not from this time forth (from now on) drive out any from before them of the nations which Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] left when he died:
Judges,2,22,"That through them I may prove Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , whether they will keep the way of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to walk in it, as their fathers did keep [it] , or not."
Judges,2,23,"Therefore the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation]."
Judges,3,1,"Now these [are] the nations which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) left, to prove Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] by them, [even] as many [of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]] as had not known all the wars of Kena’an [Merchant];"
Judges,3,2,"Only that the generations of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;"
Judges,3,3," [Namely] , five lords of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and all the Kena’ani [Merchant] , and the Tzidonim [Hunting] , and the Hivi [Villagers] that dwelt in mount L’vanon [Whiteness] , from mount Ba’al [lord (a false god)] between Mount Ba’al-Hermon [Lord of Destruction] unto the entering in of Hamat [Fortress]."
Judges,3,4,"And they were to prove Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Judges,3,5,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] dwelt among the Kena’ani [Merchant] , Hitti [Terrorists] , and Emori [Highlanders] , and P’rizi [Dwellers in Unwalled Towns] , and Hivi [Villagers] , and Y’vusi [Threshers, Trampled Under Foot]:"
Judges,3,6,"And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods."
Judges,3,7,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and forgot the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and served Ba’alim [lords (false gods)] and the groves."
Judges,3,8,"Therefore the anger of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was hot against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and he sold them into the hand of Kushan-Rish’atayim [Twice-Wicked Full of Darkness (A Reference to Ethiopia)] king of Aram (Mesopotamia/Aram (Syria) [exalted]) [Elevated Between the Two Rivers] : and the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] served Kushan-Rish’atayim [Twice-Wicked Full of Darkness (A Reference to Ethiopia)] eight years."
Judges,3,9,"And when the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) raised up a deliverer to the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , who delivered them, [even] ‘Otni’el [Lion of God] the son of K’naz [Hunter] , Kalev [Dog] ’s younger brother."
Judges,3,10,"And the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came upon him, and he judged Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and went out to war: and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) delivered Kushan-Rish’atayim [Twice-Wicked Full of Darkness (A Reference to Ethiopia)] king of Aram (Mesopotamia/Aram (Syria) [exalted]) [Elevated Between the Two Rivers] into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Kushan-Rish’atayim [Twice-Wicked Full of Darkness (A Reference to Ethiopia)]."
Judges,3,11,And the land had rest forty years. And ‘Otni’el [Lion of God] the son of K’naz [Hunter] died.
Judges,3,12,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did evil again in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) strengthened ‘Eglon [Calf-like] the king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Judges,3,13,"And he gathered unto him the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] and ‘Amalek [Dweller in a Valley] , and went and struck Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and possessed the city of palm trees."
Judges,3,14,So the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] served ‘Eglon [Calf-like] the king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] eighteen years.
Judges,3,15,"But when the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) raised them up a deliverer, Ehud [I will Give Thanks: I will be Praised] the son of Gera [A Grain] , from the tribe of Binyamin [A Son of the Right Hand] , a man left-handed: and by him the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] sent a present unto ‘Eglon [Calf-like] the king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father]."
Judges,3,16,"But Ehud [I will Give Thanks: I will be Praised] made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his clothing upon his right thigh."
Judges,3,17,And he brought the present unto ‘Eglon [Calf-like] king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] : and ‘Eglon [Calf-like] [was] a very fat man.
Judges,3,18,"And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bore the present."
Judges,3,19,"But he himself turned again from the quarries that [were] by Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] , and said, I have a secret errand unto you i , O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him."
Judges,3,20,"And Ehud [I will Give Thanks: I will be Praised] came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud [I will Give Thanks: I will be Praised] said, I have a message from God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] unto you i . And he arose out of [his] seat."
Judges,3,21,"And Ehud [I will Give Thanks: I will be Praised] put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:"
Judges,3,22,"And the handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out."
Judges,3,23,"Then Ehud [I will Give Thanks: I will be Praised] went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them."
Judges,3,24,"When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour [were] locked, they said, Surely he covers his feet in his summer chamber."
Judges,3,25,"And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened [them] : and, behold, their lord [was] fallen down dead on the earth."
Judges,3,26,"And Ehud [I will Give Thanks: I will be Praised] escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Se’irah [The Shaggy]."
Judges,3,27,"And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , and the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went down with him from the mount, and he before them."
Judges,3,28,"And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has delivered your enemies the Mo’avi [of his father] into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Yarden [Descender] toward Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , and did not allow a man to pass over."
Judges,3,29,"And they killed of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man."
Judges,3,30,So Mo’av [Seed of my Father] was subdued that day under the hand of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] . And the land had rest eighty years.
Judges,3,31,"And after him was Shamgar [Sword] the son of ‘Anat [Answer] , which killed of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] six hundred men with an ox goad (a pointed stick to get animals moving) : and he also delivered Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Judges,4,1,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] again did evil in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , when Ehud [I will Give Thanks: I will be Praised] was dead."
Judges,4,2,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sold them into the hand of Yavin [Whom God Observes] king of Kena’an [Merchant] , that reigned in Hatzor [Castle] ; the captain of whose host [was] Sisra [Battle Array (to put on; to clothe)], which dwelt in Haroshet-HaGoyim [Woodland of the Gentiles] of the Gentiles."
Judges,4,3,And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
Judges,4,4,"And D’vorah [Bee] , a prophetess, the wife of Lapidot [Torches] , she judged Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] at that time."
Judges,4,5,And she dwelt under the palm tree of D’vorah [Bee] between Ramah [Hill] and Beit-El [House of God] in mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] : and the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came up to her for judgment.
Judges,4,6,"And she sent and called Barak [Lightning] the son of Avino’am [My Father is Delight] out of Kedesh [Holy Place] [Holy Place] in Naftali [My Wrestling] , and said unto him, Has not the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] commanded, [saying] , Go and draw toward mount Tavor [Mound] , and take with you i ten thousand men of the children of Naftali [My Wrestling] and of the children of Z’vulun [Glorious Dwelling Place]?"
Judges,4,7,"And I will draw unto you i to the river Kishon [Winding] Sisra [Battle Array (to put on; to clothe)], the captain of Yavin [Whom God Observes] ’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into you i hand."
Judges,4,8,"And Barak [Lightning] said unto her, If you i will go with me, then I will go: but if you i will not go with me, [then] I will not go."
Judges,4,9,"And she said, I will surely go with you i : notwithstanding the journey that you i take shall not be for your i honour; for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall sell Sisra [Battle Array (to put on; to clothe)] into the hand of a woman. And D’vorah [Bee] arose, and went with Barak [Lightning] to Kedesh [Holy Place] [Holy Place]."
Judges,4,10,And Barak [Lightning] called Z’vulun [Glorious Dwelling Place] and Naftali [My Wrestling] to Kedesh [Holy Place] ; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and D’vorah [Bee] went up with him.
Judges,4,11,"Now Hever [Comrade] the Kayin [Possession], [which was] of the children of Hovav [Cherished] the father in law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , had severed himself from the Keini [traveling tinkers or blacksmiths] , and pitched his tent unto the plain of Tza’ananim [Removings] , which [is] by Kedesh [Holy Place] [Holy Place] .."
Judges,4,12,And they showed Sisra [Battle Array (to put on; to clothe)] that Barak [Lightning] the son of Avino’am [My Father is Delight] was gone up to mount Tavor [Mound].
Judges,4,13,"And Sisra [Battle Array (to put on; to clothe)] gathered together all his chariots, [even] nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that [were] with him, from Haroshet-HaGoyim [Woodland of the Gentiles] unto the river of Kishon [Winding]."
Judges,4,14,"And D’vorah [Bee] said unto Barak [Lightning] , Up; for this [is] the day in which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has delivered Sisra [Battle Array (to put on; to clothe)] into you i hand: is not the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) gone out before you i ? So Barak [Lightning] went down from mount Tavor [Mound] , and ten thousand men after him."
Judges,4,15,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) scattered (defeated in battle) Sisra [Battle Array (to put on; to clothe)] , and all [his] chariots, and all [his] host, with the edge of the sword before Barak [Lightning] ; so that Sisra [Battle Array (to put on; to clothe)] lighted down off [his] chariot, and fled away on his feet."
Judges,4,16,"But Barak [Lightning] pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Haroshet-HaGoyim [Woodland of the Gentiles] of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisra [Battle Array (to put on; to clothe)] fell upon the edge of the sword; [and] there was not a man left."
Judges,4,17,However Sisra [Battle Array (to put on; to clothe)] fled away on his feet to the tent of Ya’el [Mountain Goat] the wife of Hever [Comrade] the Kayin [Possession] : for [there was] peace between Yavin [Whom God Observes] the king of Hatzor [Castle] and the house of Hever [Comrade] the Keini [Possession].
Judges,4,18,"And Ya’el [Mountain Goat] went out to meet Sisra [Battle Array (to put on; to clothe)] , and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a Mantle (cloak; covering garment) (cloak)."
Judges,4,19,"And he said unto her, Give me, I pray you i , a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him."
Judges,4,20,"Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man does come and enquire of you i , and say, Is there any man here? that you i shall say, No."

Judges,6,20,"And the angel of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay [them] upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so."

Judges,6,22,"And when Gid’on [Hewer] perceived that he [was] an angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , Gid’on [Hewer] said, Alas, O Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) ! for because I have seen an angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) face to face."
Judges,6,23,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto him, Peace [be] unto you i ; fear not: you i shall not die."

Judges,6,25,"And it came to pass the same night, that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto him, Take you i father’s young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] that you i father has, and cut down the grove that [is] by it:"
Judges,6,26,"And build an altar unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which you i shall cut down."
Judges,6,27,"Then Gid’on [Hewer] took ten men of his servants, and did as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had said unto him: and [so] it was, because he feared his father’s household, and the men of the city, that he could not do [it] by day, that he did [it] by night."
Judges,6,28,"And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] was cast down, and the grove was cut down that [was] by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar [that was] built."
Judges,6,29,"And they said one to another, Who has done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gid’on [Hewer] the son of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] has done this thing."
Judges,6,30,"Then the men of the city said unto Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] , Bring out you i son, that he may die: because he has cast down the altar of Ba’al [lord (a false god)] , and because he has cut down the grove that [was] by it."
Judges,6,31,"And Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] said unto all that stood against him, Will you 2f plead for Ba’al [lord (a false god)] ? will you 2f save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst [it is yet] morning: if he [be] a god, let him plead for himself, because [one] has cast down his altar."
Judges,6,32,"Therefore on that day he called him Yeruba’al [let Ba’al defend] , saying, Let Ba’al [lord (a false god)] plead against him, because he has thrown down his altar."
Judges,6,33,"Then all the Midyanim [Strife] and the ‘Amalekim [Valley Dwellers] and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Yizre’el [God Sows]."
Judges,6,34,"But the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came upon Gid’on [Hewer] , and he blew a trumpet; and Avi-ezer [My Father is Help] was gathered after him."
Judges,6,35,"And he sent messengers throughout all M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] ; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher [Happy] , and unto Z’vulun [Glorious Dwelling Place] , and unto Naftali [My Wrestling] ; and they came up to meet them."
Judges,6,36,"And Gid’on [Hewer] said unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , If you i will save Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] by my hand, as you i have said,"
Judges,6,37,"Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; [and] if the dew be on the fleece only, and [it be] dry upon all the earth [beside] , then shall I know that you i will save Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] by my hand, as you i have said."
Judges,6,38,"And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water."
Judges,6,39,"And Gid’on [Hewer] said unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , Let not you i anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray you i , but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew."
Judges,6,40,"And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground."
Judges,7,1,"Then Yeruba’al [let Ba’al defend] , who [is] Gid’on [Hewer] , and all the people that [were] with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of ‘Ein-Harod [spring of Herod (fear)] : so that the host of the Midyanim [Strife] were on the north side of them, by Giv’at-Moreh [Hill of Teacher] , in the valley."
Judges,7,2,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Gid’on [Hewer] , The people that [are] with you i [are] too many for me to give the Midyanim [Strife] into their hands, lest Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand has saved me."
Judges,7,3,"Now therefore come (let us begin!) , proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever [is] fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gil’ad [Rocky Region] . And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand."
Judges,7,4,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Gid’on [Hewer] , The people [are] yet [too] many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for you i there: and it shall be, [that] of whom I say unto you i , This shall go with you i , the same shall go with you i ; and of whomsoever I say unto you i , This shall not go with you i , the same shall not go."
Judges,7,5,"So he brought down the people unto the water: and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Gid’on [Hewer] , Every one that laps of the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, him shall you i set by himself; likewise everyone that bows down upon his knees to drink."
Judges,7,6,"And the number of them that lapped, [putting] their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water."
Judges,7,7,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Gid’on [Hewer] , By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midyanim [Strife] into you i hand: and let all the [other] people go every man unto his place."
Judges,7,8,"So the people took victuals (food for humans) in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all [the rest of] Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midyan [Strife] was beneath him in the valley."
Judges,7,9,"And it came to pass the same night, that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto him, Arise, get you i down unto the host; for I have delivered it into you i hand."
Judges,7,10,"But if you i fear to go down, go you i with Purah [Bough] you i servant down to the host:"
Judges,7,11,And you i shall hear what they say; and afterward shall you i hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Purah [Bough] his servant unto the outside of the armed men that [were] in the host.
Judges,7,12,"And the Midyanim [Strife] and the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley] and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels [were] without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude."
Judges,7,13,"And when Gid’on [Hewer] was come, behold, [there was] a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midyan [Strife] , and came unto a tent, and struck it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along."
Judges,7,14,"And his fellow answered and said, This [is] nothing else save the sword of Gid’on [Hewer] the son of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] , a man of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]: [for] into his hand has God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] delivered Midyan [Strife] , and all the host."
Judges,7,15,"And it was [so] , when Gid’on [Hewer] heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and said, Arise; for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has delivered into your hand the host of Midyan [Strife]."
Judges,7,16,"And he divided the three hundred men [into] three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man’s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers."
Judges,7,17,"And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be [that] , as I do, so shall you 2f do."
Judges,7,18,"When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that [are] with me, then blow you 2f the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, [The sword] of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and of Gid’on [Hewer]."
Judges,7,19,"So Gid’on [Hewer] , and the hundred men that [were] with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers that [were] in their hands."
Judges,7,20,"And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow [withal] : and they cried, The sword of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and of Gid’on [Hewer]."
Judges,7,21,"And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled."
Judges,7,22,"And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) set every man’s sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Beit-Sheetah [House of the Acacia Tree] in Tz’rerah [Oppression], [and] to the border of Avel-M’cholah [Meadow of Dancing] , unto Tabat [Celebrated]."
Judges,7,23,"And the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] gathered themselves together out of Naftali [My Wrestling] , and out of Asher [Happy] , and out of all M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , and pursued after the Midyanim [Strife]."
Judges,7,24,"And Gid’on [Hewer] sent messengers throughout all mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , saying, Come down against the Midyanim [Strife] , and take before them the waters unto Beit-Barah [House of (the) Ford] and Yarden [Descender] . Then all the men of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Beit-Barah [House of (the) Ford] and Yarden [Descender]."
Judges,7,25,"And they took two princes of the Midyanim [Strife] , ‘Orev [Raven] and Ze’ev [Wolf] ; and they killed ‘Orev [Raven] upon the rock ‘Orev [Raven] , and Ze’ev [Wolf] they killed at the winepress of Ze’ev [Wolf] , and pursued Midyan [Strife] , and brought the heads of ‘Orev [Raven] and Ze’ev [Wolf] to Gid’on [Hewer] on the other side Yarden [Descender]."
Judges,8,1,"And the men of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] said unto him, Why have you i served us thus, that you i called us not, when you i went to fight with the Midyanim [Strife] ? And they did quarrel with him sharply."
Judges,8,2,"And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? [Is] not the gleaning of the grapes of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] better than the vintage of Avi-ezer [My Father is Help]?"
Judges,8,3,"God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has delivered into your hands the princes of Midyan [Strife] , ‘Orev [Raven] and Ze’ev [Wolf] : and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that."
Judges,8,4,"And Gid’on [Hewer] came to Yarden [Descender], [and] passed over, he, and the three hundred men that [were] with him, faint, yet pursuing [them]."
Judges,8,5,"And he said unto the men of Sukkot [Booths] , Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they [be] faint, and I am pursuing after Zevach [Deprived of Protection] and Tzalmuna [Deprived of Protection] , kings of Midyan [Strife]."
Judges,8,6,"And the princes of Sukkot [Booths] said, [Are] the hands of Zevach [Deprived of Protection] and Tzalmuna [Deprived of Protection] now in you i hand, that we should give bread unto you i army?"
Judges,8,7,"And Gid’on [Hewer] said, Therefore when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has delivered Zevach [Deprived of Protection] and Tzalmuna [Deprived of Protection] into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers."
Judges,8,8,"And he went up there to P’nu’el [Facing God] , and spoke unto them likewise: and the men of P’nu’el [Facing God] answered him as the men of Sukkot [Booths] had answered [him]."
Judges,8,9,"And he spoke also unto the men of P’nu’el [Facing God] , saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower."
Judges,8,10,"Now Zevach [Deprived of Protection] and Tzalmuna [Deprived of Protection] [were] in Karkor [Foundation] , and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand [men] , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword."
Judges,8,11,"And Gid’on [Hewer] went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Novach [Barking] and Yogbehah [Lofty] , and struck the host: for the host was secure."
Judges,8,12,"And when Zevach [Deprived of Protection] and Tzalmuna [Deprived of Protection] fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midyan [Strife] , Zevach [Deprived of Protection] and Tzalmuna [Deprived of Protection] , and scattered (defeated in battle) all the host."
Judges,8,13,"And Gid’on [Hewer] the son of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] returned from battle before the sun [was up],"
Judges,8,14,"And caught a young man of the men of Sukkot [Booths] , and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Sukkot [Booths] , and the elders thereof, [even] threescore and seventeen men."
Judges,8,15,"And he came unto the men of Sukkot [Booths] , and said, Behold Zevach [Deprived of Protection] and Tzalmuna [Deprived of Protection] , with whom you 2f did upbraid me, saying, [Are] the hands of Zevach [Deprived of Protection] and Tzalmuna [Deprived of Protection] now in you i hand, that we should give bread unto you i men [that are] weary?"
Judges,8,16,"And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Sukkot [Booths]."
Judges,8,17,"And he beat down the tower of P’nu’el [Facing God] , and killed the men of the city."
Judges,8,18,"Then said he unto Zevach [Deprived of Protection] and Tzalmuna [Deprived of Protection] , What manner of men [were they] whom you 2f killed at Tavor [Mound] ? And they answered, As you i [are] , so [were] they; each one resembled the children of a king."
Judges,8,19,"And he said, They [were] my brethren, [even] the sons of my mother: [as] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives, if you 2f had saved them alive, I would not slay you."
Judges,8,20,"And he said unto Yeter [abundance] his firstborn, Up, [and] slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he [was] yet a youth."
Judges,8,21,"Then Zevach [Deprived of Protection] and Tzalmuna [Deprived of Protection] said, Rise you i , and fall upon us: for as the man [is, so is] his strength. And Gid’on [Hewer] arose, and killed Zevach [Deprived of Protection] and Tzalmuna [Deprived of Protection] , and took away the ornaments that [were] on their camels’ necks."
Judges,8,22,"Then the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said unto Gid’on [Hewer] , Rule you i over us, both you i , and you i son, and you i son’s son also: for you i have delivered us from the hand of Midyan [Strife]."
Judges,8,23,"And Gid’on [Hewer] said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall rule over you."
Judges,8,24,"And Gid’on [Hewer] said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that you 2f would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they [were] Yishma’elim (Ishmaelites) [God will Hear] .)"
Judges,8,25,"And they answered, We will willingly give [them] . And they spread a garment, and did cast in it every man the earrings of his prey."
Judges,8,26,"And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred [shekels] of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple clothing that [was] on the kings of Midyan [Strife] , and beside the chains that [were] about their camels’ necks."
Judges,8,27,"And Gid’on [Hewer] made an ephod (vest) thereof, and put it in his city, [even] in ‘Ofrah [Fawn] : and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went there a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gid’on [Hewer] , and to his house."
Judges,8,28,"Thus was Midyan [Strife] subdued before the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gid’on [Hewer]."
Judges,8,29,And Yeruba’al [let Ba’al defend] the son of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] went and dwelt in his own house.
Judges,8,30,And Gid’on [Hewer] had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.
Judges,8,31,"And his concubine that [was] in Sh’khem [Shoulder] , she also bore him a son, whose name he called Avi-Melekh [My Father is King]."
Judges,8,32,"And Gid’on [Hewer] the son of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulcher of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] his father, in ‘Ofrah [Fawn] of the Avi’ezri [My Father is Help]."
Judges,8,33,"And it came to pass, as soon as Gid’on [Hewer] was dead, that the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] turned again, and went a whoring after Ba’alim [lords (false gods)] , and made Ba’al-B’rit [lord of the covenant] their god."
Judges,8,34,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] remembered not the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:"

Judges,9,1,"And Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] the son of Yeruba’al [let Ba’al defend] went to Sh’khem [Shoulder] unto his mother’s brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,"
Judges,9,2,"Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Sh’khem [Shoulder] , Whether [is] better for you, either that all the sons of Yeruba’al [let Ba’al defend], [which are] threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I [am] your bone and your flesh."
Judges,9,3,"And his mother’s brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Sh’khem [Shoulder] all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] ; for they said, He [is] our brother."
Judges,9,4,"And they gave him threescore and ten [pieces] of silver out of the house of Ba’al-B’rit [lord of the covenant] , which Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] hired vain and light persons, which followed him."
Judges,9,5,"And he went unto his father’s house at ‘Ofrah [Fawn] , and killed his brethren the sons of Yeruba’al [let Ba’al defend], [being] threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] the youngest son of Yeruba’al [let Ba’al defend] was left; for he hid himself."
Judges,9,6,"And all the men of Sh’khem [Shoulder] gathered together, and all the Beit-Millo [fortification (defensive structure) or mound] [House of the Fortification (defensive structure)] , and went, and made Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] king, by the plain of the pillar that [was] in Sh’khem [Shoulder]."
Judges,9,7,"And when they told [it] to Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] , he went and stood in the top of mount G’rizim [Cuttings Off] , and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Listen unto me, you 2f men of Sh’khem [Shoulder] , that God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] may hearken unto you."
Judges,9,8,"The trees went forth [on a time] to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign you i over us."

Judges,9,10,"And the trees said to the fig tree, Come you i, [and] reign over us."
Judges,9,11,"But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
Judges,9,12,"Then said the trees unto the vine, Come you i, [and] reign over us."

Judges,9,16,"Now therefore, if you 2f have done truly and sincerely, in that you 2f have made Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] king, and if you 2f have dealt well with Yeruba’al [let Ba’al defend] and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;"
Judges,9,17,"(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midyan [Strife]:"
Judges,9,18,"And you 2f are risen up against my father’s house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] , the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Sh’khem [Shoulder] , because he [is] your brother;)"
Judges,9,19,"If you 2f then have dealt truly and sincerely with Yeruba’al [let Ba’al defend] and with his house this day, [then] rejoice you 2f in Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] , and let him also rejoice in you:"

Judges,9,23,Then God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] sent an evil spirit between Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] and the men of Sh’khem [Shoulder] ; and the men of Sh’khem [Shoulder] dealt treacherously with Avi-Melekh [My Father is King]:
Judges,9,24,"That the cruelty [done] to the threescore and ten sons of Yeruba’al [let Ba’al defend] might come, and their blood be laid upon Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] their brother, which killed them; and upon the men of Sh’khem [Shoulder] , which aided him in the killing of his brethren."

Judges,9,28,"And Ga’al [Loathing] the son of Eved [A Slave] said, Who [is] Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] , and who [is] Sh’khem [Shoulder] , that we should serve him? [is] not [he] the son of Yeruba’al [let Ba’al defend] ? and Z’vul [Exalted] his officer? serve the men of Hamor [male-donkey (ass)] the father of Sh’khem [Shoulder] : for why should we serve him?"
Judges,9,29,"And would to God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] this people were under my hand! then would I remove Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] . And he said to Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] , Increase you i army, and come out."

Judges,9,32,"Now therefore up by night, you i and the people that [is] with you i , and lie in wait in the field:"
Judges,9,33,"And it shall be, [that] in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you i shall rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, [when] he and the people that [is] with him come out against you i , then may you i do to them as you i shall find occasion."

Judges,9,35,"And Ga’al [Loathing] the son of Eved [A Slave] went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] rose up, and the people that [were] with him, from lying in wait."
Judges,9,36,"And when Ga’al [Loathing] saw the people, he said to Z’vul [Exalted] , Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Z’vul [Exalted] said unto him, you i see the shadow of the mountains as [if they were] men."
Judges,9,37,"And Ga’al [Loathing] spoke again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of M’on’nim [Fortune Teller]."
Judges,9,38,"Then said Z’vul [Exalted] unto him, Where [is] now you i mouth, which you i said, Who [is] Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] , that we should serve him? [is] not this the people that you i have despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them."

Judges,9,48,"And Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] got him up to Mount Tzalmon [Shady] , he and all the people that [were] with him; and Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid [it] on his shoulder, and said unto the people that [were] with him, What you 2f have seen me do, make haste, [and] do as I [have done]."
Judges,9,49,"And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] , and put [them] to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Sh’khem [Shoulder] died also, about a thousand men and women."

Judges,9,55,"And when the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] saw that Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] was dead, they departed every man unto his place."
Judges,9,56,"Thus God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] rendered the wickedness of Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] , which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:"
Judges,9,57,And all the evil of the men of Sh’khem [Shoulder] did God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] the son of Yeruba’al [let Ba’al defend].
Judges,10,1,"And after Avi-Melekh [My Father is King] there arose to defend Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] Tola [worm] the son of Puah [Splendid] , the son of Dodo [his beloved] , a man of Yissakhar [There Is Recompense] ; and he dwelt in Shamir [A Point or Thorn] in mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful]."

Judges,10,6,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did evil again in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and served Ba’alim [lords (false gods)] , and ‘Ashtarot [Star (female deity)] , and the gods of Aram (Aram (Syria) [exalted]) , and the gods of Tzidon [Hunting] , and the gods of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , and the gods of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , and the gods of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and forsook the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and served not him."
Judges,10,7,"And the anger of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was hot against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and he sold them into the hands of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and into the hands of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred]."
Judges,10,8,"And that year they vexed and oppressed the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : eighteen years, all the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that [were] on the other side Yarden [Descender] in the land of the Emori [Highlanders] , which [is] in Gil’ad [Rocky Region]."
Judges,10,9,"Moreover the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] passed over Yarden [Descender] to fight also against Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and against Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , and against the house of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] ; so that Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] was sore distressed."
Judges,10,10,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, We have sinned against you i , both because we have forsaken our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and also served Ba’alim [lords (false gods)]."
Judges,10,11,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [Did] not [I deliver you] from the Mitzri, and from the Emori [Highlanders] , from the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , and from the P’lishtim [Immigrants]?"
Judges,10,12,"The people of Tzidon [Hunting] also, and the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley] , and the Ma’on [Habitation] , did oppress you; and you 2f cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand."
Judges,10,13,"Yet you 2f have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more."
Judges,10,14,Go and cry unto the gods which you 2f have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.
Judges,10,15,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , We have sinned: do you i unto us whatsoever seems good unto you i ; deliver us only, we pray you i , this day."
Judges,10,16,"And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and his soul was grieved for the misery of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."

Judges,10,18,"And the people [and] princes of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] said one to another, What man [is he] that will begin to fight against the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] ? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gil’ad [Rocky Region]."
Judges,11,1,"Now Yiftach [He Opens] the Gil’adi [Hill of Testimony] was a mighty man of valour, and he [was] the son of an prostitute: and Gil’ad [Rocky Region] begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) Yiftach [He Opens]."
Judges,11,2,"And Gil’ad [Rocky Region] ’s wife bore him sons; and his wife’s sons grew up, and they thrust out Yiftach [He Opens] , and said unto him, you i shall not inherit in our father’s house; for you i [are] the son of a strange woman."

Judges,11,5,"And it was so, that when the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] made war against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , the elders of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] went to fetch Yiftach [He Opens] out of the land of Tov [Good]:"
Judges,11,6,"And they said unto Yiftach [He Opens] , Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of ‘Amon [Inbred]."
Judges,11,7,"And Yiftach [He Opens] said unto the elders of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , Did not you 2f hate me, and expel me out of my father’s house? and why are you 2f come unto me now when you 2f are in distress?"
Judges,11,8,"And the elders of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] said unto Yiftach [He Opens] , Therefore we turn again to you i now, that you i may go with us, and fight against the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gil’ad [Rocky Region]."
Judges,11,9,"And Yiftach [He Opens] said unto the elders of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , If you 2f bring me home again to fight against the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) deliver them before me, shall I be your head?"
Judges,11,10,"And the elders of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] said unto Yiftach [He Opens] , The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) be witness between us, if we do not so according to you i words."
Judges,11,11,"Then Yiftach [He Opens] went with the elders of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , and the people made him head and captain over them: and Yiftach [He Opens] uttered all his words before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in Mitzpah [Watchtower]."
Judges,11,12,"And Yiftach [He Opens] sent messengers unto the king of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , saying, What have you i to do with me, that you i are come against me to fight in my land?"
Judges,11,13,"And the king of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] answered unto the messengers of Yiftach [He Opens] , Because Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] took away my land, when they came up out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , from ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] even unto Yabok [luxuriant emptying river] , and unto Yarden [Descender] : now therefore restore those [lands] again peaceably."
Judges,11,14,And Yiftach [He Opens] sent messengers again unto the king of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred]:
Judges,11,15,"And said unto him, Thus says Yiftach [He Opens] , Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] took not away the land of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , nor the land of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred]:"
Judges,11,16,"But when Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came up from Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh [Holy];"
Judges,11,17,"Then Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] sent messengers unto the king of Edom [Red] , saying, Let me, I pray you i , pass through you i land: but the king of Edom [Red] would not hearken [thereto] .

Judges,11,18,"Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom [Red] , and the land of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , and came by the east side of the land of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , and pitched on the other side of ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] , but came not within the border of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] : for ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] [was] the border of Mo’av [Seed of my Father]."
Judges,11,19,"And Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] sent messengers unto Sichon [Warrior] king of the Emori [Highlanders] , the king of Heshbon [Stronghold] ; and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said unto him, Let us pass, we pray you i , through you i land into my place."
Judges,11,20,"But Sichon [Warrior] trusted not Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to pass through his coast: but Sichon [Warrior] gathered all his people together, and pitched in Yachatz [Trampled Down] , and fought against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Judges,11,21,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] delivered Sichon [Warrior] and all his people into the hand of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and they struck them: so Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] possessed all the land of the Emori [Highlanders] , the inhabitants of that country."
Judges,11,22,"And they possessed all the coasts of the Emori [Highlanders] , from ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] even unto Yabok [luxuriant emptying river] , and from the wilderness even unto Yarden [Descender]."
Judges,11,23,"So now the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] has dispossessed the Emori [Highlanders] from before his people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and should you i possess it?"
Judges,11,24,"Will not you i possess that which K’mosh [Subduer] your i god gives you i to possess? So whomsoever the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] shall drive out from before us, them will we possess."
Judges,11,25,"And now [are] you i anything better than Balak [Devastator] the son of Zippor [Sparrow] , king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] ? did he ever strive against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , or did he ever fight against them,"
Judges,11,26,"While Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] dwelt in Heshbon [Stronghold] and her towns, and in ‘Aeo’er [Ruins] and her towns, and in all the cities that [be] along by the coasts of ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] , three hundred years? why therefore did you 2f not recover [them] within that time?"
Judges,11,27,"For what reason I have not sinned against you i , but you i do me wrong to war against me: let Yehovah HaShofet [Messiah Pre-Incarnate The Judge] be judge this day between the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and the children of ‘Amon [Inbred]."
Judges,11,28,However the king of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] listened not unto the words of Yiftach [He Opens] which he sent him.
Judges,11,29,"Then the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came upon Yiftach [He Opens] , and he passed over Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , and M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , and passed over Mitzpah [Watchtower] of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , and from Mitzpah [Watchtower] of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] he passed over [unto] the children of ‘Amon [Inbred]."
Judges,11,30,"And Yiftach [He Opens] vowed a vow unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, If you i shall without fail deliver the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] into my hands,"
Judges,11,31,"Then it shall be, that whatsoever comes forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , shall surely be the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] , and I will offer it up for a burnt offering."
Judges,11,32,So Yiftach [He Opens] passed over unto the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] to fight against them; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) delivered them into his hands.
Judges,11,33,"And he struck them from ‘Aeo’er [Ruins] , even till you i come to Minnit [distribution], [even] twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] were subdued before the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Judges,11,34,"And Yiftach [He Opens] came to Mitzpah [Watchtower] unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she [was his] only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter."
Judges,11,35,"And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! you i have brought me very low, and you i are one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and I cannot go back."
Judges,11,36,"And she said unto him, My father, [if] you i have opened you i mouth unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , do to me according to that which has proceeded out of you i mouth; forasmuch as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has taken vengeance for you i of you i enemies, [even] of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred]."
Judges,11,37,"And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows."
Judges,11,38,"And he said, Go. And he sent her away [for] two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains."
Judges,11,39,"And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her [according] to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God],"
Judges,11,40, [That] the daughters of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went yearly to lament the daughter of Yiftach [He Opens] the Gil’adi [Hill of Testimony] four days in a year.
Judges,12,1,"And the men of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Yiftach [He Opens] , For what reason passed you i over to fight against the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , and did not call us to go with you i ? we will burn your i house upon you i with fire."
Judges,12,2,"And Yiftach [He Opens] said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] ; and when I called you, you 2f delivered me not out of their hands."
Judges,12,3,"And when I saw that you 2f delivered [me] not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are you 2f come up unto me this day, to fight against me?"
Judges,12,4,"Then Yiftach [He Opens] gathered together all the men of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , and fought with Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] : and the men of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] struck Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , because they said, You 2f Gil’adi [are] fugitives of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] among the Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful], [and] among the M’nasheh [Causing to Forget]."
Judges,12,5,"And the Gil’adi took the passages of Yarden [Descender] before the Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] : and it was [so] , that when those Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] aid unto him, [Are] you i an Efrayimiti [Doubly Fruitful] ? If he said, No;"
Judges,12,6,"Then said they unto him, Say now Shibbolet [Flowing Stream] : and he said Sibbolet [Ear of Grain or Wheat] : for he could not frame to pronounce [it] right. Then they took him, and killed him at the passages of Yarden [Descender] : and there fell at that time of the Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] forty and two thousand."
Judges,12,7,"And Yiftach [He Opens] judged Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] six years. Then died Yiftach [He Opens] the Gil’adi [Hill of Testimony] , and was buried in [one of] the cities of Gil’ad [Rocky Region]."
Judges,12,8,And after him Ibtzan [Their Whiteness] of Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] judged Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
Judges,12,9,"And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, [whom] he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] seven years."
Judges,12,10,"Then died Ibtzan [Their Whiteness] , and was buried at Beit-Lechem [House of Bread]."
Judges,12,11,"And after him Elon [Mighty] , a Z’vuluni [Wished-For Habitation] , judged Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and he judged Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ten years."
Judges,12,12,"And Elon [Mighty] the Z’vuluni [Wished-For Habitation] died, and was buried in Ayalon [Field of Deer] in the country of Z’vulun [Glorious Dwelling Place]."
Judges,12,13,"And after him Avdon [Servile] the son of Hillel [Praising] , a Pir’atoni [Princely] , judged Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Judges,12,14,"And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] eight years."
Judges,12,15,"And Avdon [Servile] the son of Hillel [Praising] the Pir’atoni [Princely] died, and was buried in Pir’aton [Princely] in the land of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , in the mount of the ‘Amalekim [Dwellers in a Valley]."
Judges,13,1,And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did evil again in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) delivered them into the hand of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] forty years.
Judges,13,2,"And there was a certain man of Tzor’ah [Hornet] , of the family of the Dani (Dan) [Judge] , whose name [was] Manoach [Rest] ; and his wife [was] barren, and bore not."
Judges,13,3,"And the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, you i [are] barren, and bear not: but you i shall conceive, and bear a son."
Judges,13,4,"Now therefore beware, I pray you i , and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean [thing]:"
Judges,13,5,"For, lo, you i shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazir [One Separated] unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of the hand of the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."
Judges,13,6,"Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] came unto me, and his Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor) [was] like the Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor) of an angel of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , very terrible: but I asked him not from what place he [was] , neither told he me his name:"
Judges,13,7,"But he said unto me, Behold, you i shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean [thing] : for the child shall be a Nazir [One Separated] to God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] from the womb to the day of his death."
Judges,13,8,"Then Manoach [Rest] entreated the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, O my Lord, let the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] which you i did send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born."
Judges,13,9,And God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] listened to the voice of Manoach [Rest] ; and the angel of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoach [Rest] her husband [was] not with her.
Judges,13,10,"And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man has appeared unto me, that came unto me the [other] day."
Judges,13,11,"And Manoach [Rest] arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, [Are] you i the man that spoke unto the woman? And he said, I [am]."
Judges,13,12,"And Manoach [Rest] said, Now let you i words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and [how] shall we do unto him?"
Judges,13,13,"And the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Manoach [Rest] , Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware."
Judges,13,14,"She may not eat of any [thing] that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean [thing] : all that I commanded her let her observe."
Judges,13,15,"And Manoach [Rest] said unto the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , I pray you i , let us detain you i , until we shall have made ready a kid for you i."
Judges,13,16,"And the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Manoach [Rest] , Though you i detain me, I will not eat of your i bread: and if you i will offer a burnt offering, you i must offer it unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) . For Manoach [Rest] knew not that he [was] an angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Judges,13,17,"And Manoach [Rest] said unto the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , What [is] your i name, that when your i sayings come to pass we may do you i honour?"
Judges,13,18,"And the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto him, Why ask you i thus after my name, seeing it [is] secret?"
Judges,13,19,"So Manoach [Rest] took a kid with a meat offering, and offered [it] upon a rock unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and [the angel] did wondrously; and Manoach [Rest] and his wife looked on."
Judges,13,20,"For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoach [Rest] and his wife looked on [it] , and fell on their faces to the ground."
Judges,13,21,But the angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) did no more appear to Manoach [Rest] and to his wife. Then Manoach [Rest] knew that he [was] an angel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
Judges,13,22,"And Manoach [Rest] said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Judges,13,23,"But his wife said unto him, If the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these [things] , nor would as at this time have told us [such things] as these."
Judges,13,24,"And the woman bore a son, and called his name Shimshon [Like the Sun] : and the child grew, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) him."
Judges,13,25,And the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) began to move him at times in the camp of Dan [Judge] between Tzor’ah [Hornet] and Eshta’ol [Entreaty].
Judges,14,1,"And Shimshon [Like the Sun] went down to Timnah [Portion] [Portion] , and saw a woman in Timnah [Portion] [Portion] of the daughters of the P’lishtim [Immigrants]."
Judges,14,2,"And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah [Portion] [Portion] of the daughters of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] : now therefore get her for me to wife."
Judges,14,3,"Then his father and his mother said unto him, [Is there] never a woman among the daughters of your i brethren, or among all my people, that you i go to take a wife of the uncircumcised P’lishtim [Immigrants] ? And Shimshon [Like the Sun] said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleases me well."
Judges,14,4,"But his father and his mother knew not that it [was] of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that he sought an occasion against the P’lishtim [Immigrants] : for at that time the P’lishtim [Immigrants] had dominion over Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Judges,14,5,"Then went Shimshon [Like the Sun] down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah [Portion] [Portion] , and came to the vineyards of Timnah [Portion] [Portion] : and, behold, a young lion roared against him."
Judges,14,6,"And the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and [he had] nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done."
Judges,14,7,"And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Shimshon [Like the Sun] well."
Judges,14,8,"And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, [there was] a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion."
Judges,14,9,"And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion."
Judges,14,10,So his father went down unto the woman: and Shimshon [Like the Sun] made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
Judges,14,11,"And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him."
Judges,14,12,"And Shimshon [Like the Sun] said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if you 2f can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find [it] out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:"
Judges,14,13,"But if you 2f cannot declare [it] me, then shall you 2f give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth you i riddle, that we may hear it."
Judges,14,14,"And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle."
Judges,14,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Shimshon [Like the Sun] ’s wife, Entice your i husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn you i and your i father’s house with fire: have you 2f called us to take that we have? [is it] not [so]?"
Judges,14,16,"And Shimshon’s [Like the Sun] ’s wife wept before him, and said, you i do but hate me, and love me not: you i have put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and have not told [it] me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told [it] my father nor my mother, and shall I tell [it] you i?"
Judges,14,17,"And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people."
Judges,14,18,"And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What [is] sweeter than honey? and what [is] stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If you 2f had not plowed with my heifer, you 2f had not found out my riddle."
Judges,14,19,"And the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon [The Fire of Infamy: I shall be Weighed], and killed thirty men of them, and took their spoil (plunder; prey; booty) , and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house."
Judges,14,20,"But Shimshon’s [Like the Sun] ’s wife was [given] to his companion, whom he had used as his friend."
Judges,15,1,"But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Shimshon [Like the Sun] visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in."
Judges,15,2,"And her father said, I truly thought that you i had utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your i companion: [is] not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray you i , instead of her."
Judges,15,3,"And Shimshon [Like the Sun] said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , though I do them a displeasure."
Judges,15,4,"And Shimshon [Like the Sun] went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the midst between two tails."
Judges,15,5,"And when he had set the brands on fire, he let [them] go into the standing corn of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards [and] olives."
Judges,15,6,"Then the P’lishtim [Immigrants] said, Who has done this? And they answered, Shimshon [Like the Sun] , the son in law of the Timni (from Timnah [Portion]) , because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the P’lishtim [Immigrants] came up, and burnt her and her father with fire."
Judges,15,7,"And Shimshon [Like the Sun] said unto them, Though you 2f have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease."
Judges,15,8,And he struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock ‘Eitam [Lair of Wild Beasts].
Judges,15,9,"Then the P’lishtim [Immigrants] went up, and pitched in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and spread themselves in Lech [Jaw]."
Judges,15,10,"And the men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] said, Why are you 2f come up against us? And they answered, To bind Shimshon [Like the Sun] are we come up, to do to him as he has done to us."
Judges,15,11,"Then three thousand men of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] went to the top of the rock ‘Eitam [Lair of Wild Beasts] , and said to Shimshon [Like the Sun] , Know you i not that the P’lishtim [Immigrants] [are] rulers over us? what [is] this [that] you i have done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them."
Judges,15,12,"And they said unto him, We are come down to bind you i , that we may deliver you i into the hand of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] . And Shimshon [Like the Sun] said unto them, Swear unto me, that you 2f will not fall upon me yourselves."
Judges,15,13,"And they spoke unto him, saying, No; but we will bind you i fast, and deliver you i into their hand: but surely we will not kill you i . And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock."
Judges,15,14," [And] when he came unto Lech [Jaw] , the P’lishtim [Immigrants] shouted against him: and the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) came mightily upon him, and the cords that [were] upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands."
Judges,15,15,"And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and killed a thousand men with that."
Judges,15,16,"And Shimshon [Like the Sun] said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men."
Judges,15,17,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramat-Lechi [Jawbone Heights]."
Judges,15,18,"And he was sore athirst, and called on the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, you i have given this great deliverance into the hand of you i servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?"
Judges,15,19,"But God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] clave an hollow place that [was] in the jaw, and there came water out of it; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof ‘Ein-HaKorei [The Spring of One Calling] , which [is] in Lech [Jaw] unto this day."
Judges,15,20,And he judged Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in the days of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] twenty years.
Judges,16,1,"Then went Shimshon [Like the Sun] to ‘Azah [The Strong] , and saw there an prostitute, and went in unto her."
Judges,16,2," [And it was told] the inhabitants of ‘Azah (‘Azah [The Strong]) , saying, Shimshon [Like the Sun] is come here. And they compassed [him] in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him."
Judges,16,3,"And Shimshon [Like the Sun] lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put [them] upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that [is] before Hevron [Seat of Association]."
Judges,16,4,"And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek [choice vines] , whose name [was] D’lilah [Feeble]."
Judges,16,5,"And the lords of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength [lies] , and by what [means] we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give you i everyone of us eleven hundred [pieces] of silver."
Judges,16,6,"And D’lilah [Feeble] said to Shimshon [Like the Sun] , Tell me, I pray you i , wherein you i great strength [lies] , and which you i might be bound to afflict you i."
Judges,16,7,"And Shimshon [Like the Sun] said unto her, If they bind me with seven green remainder that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man."
Judges,16,8,"Then the lords of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] brought up to her seven green remainder which had not been dried, and she bound him with them."
Judges,16,9,"Now [there were] men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The P’lishtim [Immigrants] [be] upon you i , Shimshon [Like the Sun] . And he broke the remainder, as a thread of tinder is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known."
Judges,16,10,"And D’lilah [Feeble] said unto Shimshon [Like the Sun] , Behold, you i have mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray you i , with which you i might be bound."
Judges,16,11,"And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man."
Judges,16,12,"D’lilah [Feeble] therefore took new ropes, and bound him with that, and said unto him, The P’lishtim [Immigrants] [be] upon you i , Shimshon [Like the Sun] . And [there were] liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he broke them from off his arms like a thread."
Judges,16,13,"And D’lilah [Feeble] said unto Shimshon [Like the Sun] , Till this point in time you i have mocked me, and told me lies: tell me which you i might be bound. And he said unto her, If you i weave the seven locks of my head with the web."
Judges,16,14,"And she fastened [it] with the pin, and said unto him, The P’lishtim [Immigrants] [be] upon you i , Shimshon [Like the Sun] . And he awakened out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web."
Judges,16,15,"And she said unto him, How can you i say, I love you i , when your i heart [is] not with me? you i have mocked me these three times, and have not told me wherein your i great strength [lies]."
Judges,16,16,"And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, [so] that his soul was vexed unto death;"
Judges,16,17,"That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There has not come a razor upon my head; for I [have been] a Nazir [One Separated] unto God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] from my mother’s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any [other] man."
Judges,16,18,"And when D’lilah [Feeble] saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] , saying, Come up this once, for he has showed me all his heart. Then the lords of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] came up unto her, and brought money in their hand."
Judges,16,19,"And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him."
Judges,16,20,"And she said, The P’lishtim [Immigrants] [be] upon you i , Shimshon [Like the Sun] . And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he did not know not that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was departed from him."
Judges,16,21,"But the P’lishtim [Immigrants] took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to ‘Azah [The Strong] , and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house."
Judges,16,22,However the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
Judges,16,23,"Then the lords of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god has delivered Shimshon [Like the Sun] our enemy into our hand."
Judges,16,24,"And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which killed many of us."
Judges,16,25,"And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Shimshon [Like the Sun] , that he may make us sport. And they called for Shimshon [Like the Sun] out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars."
Judges,16,26,"And Shimshon [Like the Sun] said unto the boy that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house stands, that I may lean upon them."
Judges,16,27,"Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] [were] there; and [there were] upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Shimshon [Like the Sun] made sport."
Judges,16,28,"And Shimshon [Like the Sun] called unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, O Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , remember me, I pray you i , and strengthen me, I pray you i , only this once, O God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , that I may be at once avenged of the P’lishtim [Immigrants] for my two eyes."
Judges,16,29,"And Shimshon [Like the Sun] took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left."
Judges,16,30,"And Shimshon [Like the Sun] said, Let me die with the P’lishtim [Immigrants] . And he bowed himself with [all his] might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that [were] in it. So the dead which he killed at his death were more than [they] which he killed in his life."
Judges,16,31,"Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought [him] up, and buried him between Tzor’ah [Hornet] and Eshta’ol [Entreaty] in the burying place of Manoach [Rest] his father. And he judged Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] twenty years."
Judges,17,1,"And there was a man of mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , whose name [was] Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?]."
Judges,17,2,"And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred [shekels] of silver that were taken from you i , about which you i cursed, and spoke of also in my ears, behold, the silver [is] with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be you i ] of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , my son."
Judges,17,3,"And when he had restored the eleven hundred [shekels] of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto you i."
Judges,17,4,"Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred [shekels] of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?]."
Judges,17,5,"And the man Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] had an house of gods, and made an ephod (vest) (ritual vest) , and teraphim (household gods) (household gods) , and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest."
Judges,17,6,"In those days [there was] no king in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [but] every man did [that which was] right in his own eyes."
Judges,17,7,"And there was a young man out of Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] in Y’hudah of the family of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , who [was] a Levi (Levite) [Joined to] , and he detained (held) there."
Judges,17,8,"And the man departed out of the city from Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] in Y’hudah to sojourn where he could find [a place] : and he came to mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] to the house of Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] , as he journeyed."
Judges,17,9,"And Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] said unto him, Whence come you i ? And he said unto him, I [am] a Levi (Levite) [Joined to] of Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] in Y’hudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find [a place]."
Judges,17,10,"And Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give you i ten [shekels] of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and you i victuals (food for humans) . So the Levi (Levite) [Joined to] (Levite) went in."
Judges,17,11,And the Levi (Levite) [Joined to] was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
Judges,17,12,"And Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] consecrated the Levi (Levite) [Joined to] ; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?]."
Judges,17,13,"Then said Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] , Now know I that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will do me good, seeing I have a Levi (Levite) [Joined to] to [my] priest."
Judges,18,1,In those days [there was] no king in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and in those days the tribe of the Dani (Dan) [Judge] sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day [all their] inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
Judges,18,2,"And the children of Dan [Judge] sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Tzor’ah [Hornet] , and from Eshta’ol [Entreaty] , to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , to the house of Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] , they lodged there."
Judges,18,3,"When they [were] by the house of Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] , they knew the voice of the young man the Levi (Levite) [Joined to] : and they turned in there, and said unto him, Who brought you i here? and what do you make in this [place] ? and what have you i here?"
Judges,18,4,"And he said unto them, Thus and thus deals Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] with me, and has hired me, and I am his priest."
Judges,18,5,"And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray you i , of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous."
Judges,18,6,"And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] your way wherein you 2f go."
Judges,18,7,"Then the five men departed, and came to Layish [Lion] , and saw the people that [were] in it, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the people of Tzidon [Hunting] , quiet and secure; and [there was] no magistrate in the land, that might put [them] to shame in [any] thing; and they [were] far from the people of Tzidon [Hunting] , and had no business with [any] man."
Judges,18,8,"And they came unto their brethren to Tzor’ah [Hornet] and Eshta’ol [Entreaty] : and their brethren said unto them, What [say] you 2f?"
Judges,18,9,"And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it [is] very good: and [are] you 2f still? be not slothful to go, [and] to enter to possess the land."
Judges,18,10,"When you 2f go, you 2f shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has given it into your hands; a place where [there is] no lack of anything that [is] in the earth."
Judges,18,11,"And there went from there of the family of the Dani (Dan) [Judge] , out of Tzor’ah [Hornet] and out of Eshta’ol [Entreaty] , six hundred men appointed with weapons of war."
Judges,18,12,"And they went up, and pitched in Kiryat-Ye’arim [City of Forests] , in Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] : wherefore they called that place Machaneh-Dan [Camp of (the) Judge] unto this day: behold, [it is] behind Kiryat-Ye’arim [City of Forests]."
Judges,18,13,"And they passed there unto mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , and came unto the house of Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?]."
Judges,18,14,"Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Layish [Lion] , and said unto their brethren, Do you 2f know that there is in these houses an ephod (vest) , and teraphim (household gods) , and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what you 2f have to do."
Judges,18,15,"And they turned toward it, and came to the house of the young man the Levi (Levite) [Joined to], [even] unto the house of Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] , and saluted him."
Judges,18,16,"And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which [were] of the children of Dan [Judge] , stood by the entering of the gate."
Judges,18,17,"And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, [and] came in there, [and] took the graven image, and the ephod (vest) , and the teraphim (household gods) , and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men [that were] appointed with weapons of war."
Judges,18,18,"And these went into Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] ’s house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod (vest) , and the teraphim (household gods) , and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do you 2f?"
Judges,18,19,"And they said unto him, Hold your i peace, lay your i hand upon you i mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: [is it] better for you i to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that you i be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
Judges,18,20,"And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod (vest) , and the teraphim (household gods) , and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people."
Judges,18,21,"So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage (baggage) before them."
Judges,18,22," [And] when they were a good way from the house of Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] , the men that [were] in the houses near to Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] ’s house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan [Judge]."
Judges,18,23,"And they cried unto the children of Dan [Judge] . And they turned their faces, and said unto Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] , What ails you i , that you i come with such a company?"
Judges,18,24,"And he said, You 2f have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and you 2f are gone away: and what have I more? and what [is] this [that] you 2f say unto me, What ails you i?"
Judges,18,25,"And the children of Dan [Judge] said unto him, Let not your i voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon you i , and you i lose your i life, with the lives of your i household."
Judges,18,26,"And the children of Dan [Judge] went their way: and when Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] saw that they [were] too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house."
Judges,18,27,"And they took [the things] which Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Layish [Lion] , unto a people [that were] at quiet and secure: and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire."
Judges,18,28,"And [there was] no deliverer, because it [was] far from Tzidon [Hunting] , and they had no business with [any] man; and it was in the valley that [lies] by Beit-Rechov [House of the Street] . And they built a city, and dwelt in it."
Judges,18,29,"And they called the name of the city Dan [Judge] , after the name of Dan [Judge] their father, who was born unto Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : howbeit the name of the city [was] Layish [Lion] at the first."
Judges,18,30,"And the children of Dan [Judge] set up the graven image: and Y’honatan [Yehovah has Given] , the son of Gershom [Exiled One] , the son of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan [Judge] until the day of the captivity of the land."
Judges,18,31,"And they set them up Mikhay’hu [Who is Like God?] ’s graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] was in Shiloh [Place of Rest]."
Judges,19,1,"And it came to pass in those days, when [there was] no king in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that there was a certain Levi (Levite) [Joined to] sojourning on the side of mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , who took to him a concubine out of Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] in Y’hudah."
Judges,19,2,"And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father’s house to Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] in Y’hudah, and was there four whole months."
Judges,19,3,"And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, [and] to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father’s house: and when the father of the girl saw him, he rejoiced to meet him."
Judges,19,4,"And his father in law, the girl’s father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there."
Judges,19,5,"And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the girl’s father said unto his son in law, Comfort you i heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way."
Judges,19,6,"And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the girl’s father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray you i , and wait all night, and let you i heart be merry."
Judges,19,7,"And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again."
Judges,19,8,"And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the girl’s father said, Comfort your i heart, I pray you i . And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them."
Judges,19,9,"And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the girl’s father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draws toward evening, I pray you wait all night: behold, the day grows to an end, lodge here, that you i heart may be merry; and tomorrow get you early on your way, that you i may go home."
Judges,19,10,"But the man would not wait that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Y’vus [Threshing Place] , which [is] Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; and [there were] with him two asses saddled, his concubine also [was] with him."
Judges,19,11," [And] when they [were] by Y’vus [Threshing Place] , the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray you i , and let us turn in into this city of the Y’vusi [Threshers, Trampled Under Foot] , and lodge in it."
Judges,19,12,"And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside here into the city of a stranger, that [is] not of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; we will pass over to Giv’ah [Hill]."
Judges,19,13,"And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Giv’ah [Hill] , or in Ramah [Hill]."
Judges,19,14,"And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them [when they were] by Giv’ah [Hill] , which [belongs] to Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength]."
Judges,19,15,"And they turned aside there, to go in [and] to lodge in Giv’ah [Hill] : and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for [there was] no man that took them into his house to lodging."
Judges,19,16,"And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which [was] also of mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] ; and he detained (held) in Giv’ah [Hill] : but the men of the place [were of] Benyamin."
Judges,19,17,"And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Where go you i ? and from what place come you i?"
Judges,19,18,"And he said unto him, We [are] passing from Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] in Y’hudah toward the side of mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] ; from there [am] I: and I went to Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] in Y’hudah, but I [am now] going to the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; and there [is] no man that receives me to house."
Judges,19,19,"Yet there is both straw and provender (food for livestock or cattle) for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your i female servant, and for the young man [which is] with your i servants: [there is] no lack of anything."
Judges,19,20,"And the old man said, Peace [be] with you i ; howsoever [let] all your i wants [lie] upon me; only lodge not in the street."
Judges,19,21,"So he brought him into his house, and gave provender (food for livestock or cattle) unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink."
Judges,19,22," [Now] as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial [Worthless, Good for Nothing] , beset the house round about, [and] beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into you i house, that we may know him."
Judges,19,23,"And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, No, my brethren, [No] , I pray you, do not [so] wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly."
Judges,19,24,"Behold, [here is] my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and you 2f mistreat them, and do with them what seems good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile (degrading) a thing."
Judges,19,25,"But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they raped her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go."
Judges,19,26,"Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her lord [was] , till it was light."
Judges,19,27,"And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down [at] the door of the house, and her hands [were] upon the threshold."
Judges,19,28,"And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But there was no answer. Then the man took her [up] upon an ass, and the man rose up, and got him unto his place."
Judges,19,29,"And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided (cut) her, [together] with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Judges,19,30,"And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came up out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak [your minds]."
Judges,20,1,"Then all the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan [Judge] even to Be’er-sheva [Well of the sevenfold Oath] , with the land of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in Mitzpah [Watchtower]."
Judges,20,2,"And the chief of all the people, [even] of all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword."
Judges,20,3,"(Now the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] heard that the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were gone up to Mitzpah [Watchtower] .) Then said the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Tell [us] , how was this wickedness [committed]?"
Judges,20,4,"And the Levi (Levite) [Joined to] , the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Giv’ah [Hill] that [belongs] to Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , I and my concubine, to lodge."
Judges,20,5,"And the men of Giv’ah [Hill] rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, [and] thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they raped, that she is dead."
Judges,20,6,"And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : for they have committed shockingly obscene and degrading crime in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Judges,20,7,"Behold, you 2f [are] all people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; give here your advice and counsel."
Judges,20,8,"And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any [of us] go to his tent, neither will we any [of us] turn into his house."
Judges,20,9,But now this [shall be] the thing which we will do to Giv’ah [Hill]; [we will go up] by lot against it;
Judges,20,10,"And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Giv’ah [Hill] of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , according to all the folly that they have wrought in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Judges,20,11,"So all the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were gathered against the city, knit together as one man."
Judges,20,12,"And the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] sent men through all the tribe of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , saying, What wickedness [is] this that is done among you?"
Judges,20,13,"Now therefore deliver [us] the men, the children of Belial [Worthless, Good for Nothing] , which [are] in Giv’ah [Hill] , that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] . But the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]:"
Judges,20,14,"But the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Giv’ah [Hill] , to go out to battle against the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Judges,20,15,"And the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Giv’ah [Hill] , which were numbered seven hundred chosen men."
Judges,20,16,"Among all this people [there were] seven hundred chosen men left-handed; everyone could sling stones at an hair [breadth] , and not miss."
Judges,20,17,"And the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , beside Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these [were] men of war."
Judges,20,18,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] arose, and went up to the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and asked counsel of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] ? And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] [shall go up] first."
Judges,20,19,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] rose up in the morning, and encamped against Giv’ah [Hill]."
Judges,20,20,And the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went out to battle against Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] ; and the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] put themselves in array (to put on; to clothe) to fight against them at Giv’ah [Hill].
Judges,20,21,"And the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] came forth out of Giv’ah [Hill] , and destroyed down to the ground of the Yisra’eli’s that day twenty and two thousand men."
Judges,20,22,"And the people the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array (to put on; to clothe) in the place where they put themselves in array (to put on; to clothe) the first day."
Judges,20,23,"(And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went up and wept before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) until even, and asked counsel of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] my brother? And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, Go up against him.)"
Judges,20,24,And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came near against the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] the second day.
Judges,20,25,"And Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] went forth against them out of Giv’ah [Hill] the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword."
Judges,20,26,"Then all the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and wept, and sat there before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Judges,20,27,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] enquired of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , (for the ark of the covenant of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [was] there in those days,"
Judges,20,28,"And Pinchas [mouth of brass] , the son of El’azar [God has helped] , the son of Aharon [Bright, Very High] , stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] my brother, or shall I cease? And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said, Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver them into you i hand."
Judges,20,29,And Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] set liers in wait round about Giv’ah [Hill].
Judges,20,30,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] went up against the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] on the third day, and put themselves in array (to put on; to clothe) against Giv’ah [Hill] , as at other times."
Judges,20,31,"And the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] went out against the people, [and] were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike of the people, [and] kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and the other to Giv’ah [Hill] in the field, about thirty men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Judges,20,32,"And the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] said, They [are] smitten down before us, as at the first. But the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways."
Judges,20,33,"And all the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array (to put on; to clothe) at Ba’al-Tamar [palm-tree] (lord of the Palms) : and the liers in wait of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came forth out of their places, [even] out of the meadows of Giv’ah [Hill]."
Judges,20,34,"And there came against Giv’ah [Hill] ten thousand chosen men out of all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil [was] near them."
Judges,20,35,And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) struck Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] before Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] destroyed of the Binyamini that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.
Judges,20,36,"So the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] saw that they were smitten: for the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] gave place to the Binyamini, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Giv’ah [Hill]."
Judges,20,37,"And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Giv’ah [Hill] ; and the liers in wait drew [themselves] along, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword."
Judges,20,38,"Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city."
Judges,20,39,"And when the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] retired in the battle, Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] began to strike [and] kill of the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as [in] the first battle."
Judges,20,40,"But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Binyamini looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven."
Judges,20,41,"And when the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] turned again, the men of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them."
Judges,20,42,Therefore they turned [their backs] before the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which [came] out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.
Judges,20,43," [Thus] they enclosed the Binyamini round about, [and] chased them, [and] trampled them down with ease over against Giv’ah [Hill] toward the sunrising."
Judges,20,44,And there fell of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] eighteen thousand men; all these [were] men of valour.
Judges,20,45,"And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon [Pomegranate] : and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gid’om [a cutting down] , and killed two thousand men of them."
Judges,20,46,So that all which fell that day of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these [were] men of valour.
Judges,20,47,"But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon [Pomegranate] , and abode in the rock Rimmon [Pomegranate] four months."
Judges,20,48,"And the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] turned again upon the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , and struck them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of [every] city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to."
Judges,21,1,"Now the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] had sworn in Mitzpah [Watchtower] , saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] to wife."
Judges,21,2,"And the people came to the house of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and abode there till even before God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;"
Judges,21,3,"And said, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , why is this come to pass in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
Judges,21,4,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings."
Judges,21,5,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said, Who [is there] among all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that came not up with the congregation unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to Mitzpah [Watchtower] , saying, He shall surely be put to death."
Judges,21,6,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] repented them for Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] this day."
Judges,21,7,"How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?"
Judges,21,8,"And they said, What one [is there] of the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] that came not up to Mitzpah [Watchtower] to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Yavesh-Gil’ad [Dry Hill of Testimony] to the assembly."
Judges,21,9,"For the people were numbered, and, behold, [there were] none of the inhabitants of Yavesh-Gil’ad [Dry Hill of Testimony] there."
Judges,21,10,"And the congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go and strike the inhabitants of Yavesh-Gil’ad [Dry Hill of Testimony] with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children."
Judges,21,11,"And this [is] the thing that you 2f shall do, You 2f shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that has lain by man."
Judges,21,12,"And they found among the inhabitants of Yavesh-Gil’ad [Dry Hill of Testimony] four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh [Place of Rest] , which [is] in the land of Kena’an [Merchant]."
Judges,21,13,"And the whole congregation sent [some] to speak to the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] that [were] in the rock Rimmon [Pomegranate] , and to call peaceably unto them."
Judges,21,14,And Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Yavesh-Gil’ad [Dry Hill of Testimony] : and yet so they sufficed them not.
Judges,21,15,"And the people repented them for Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , because that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had made a breach (breaking forth; a break; opening, inlet) in the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Judges,21,16,"Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength]?"
Judges,21,17,"And they said, [There must be] an inheritance for them that be escaped of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , that a tribe be not destroyed out of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Judges,21,18,"However we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] have sworn, saying, Cursed [be] he that gives a wife to Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength]."
Judges,21,19,"Then they said, Behold, [there is] a feast of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in Shiloh [Place of Rest] yearly [in a place] which [is] on the north side of Beit-El [House of God] , on the east side of the highway that goes up from Beit-El [House of God] to Sh’khem [Shoulder] , and on the south of Levonah [Frankincense]."
Judges,21,20,"Therefore they commanded the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;"
Judges,21,21,"And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh [Place of Rest] come out to dance in dances, then come you 2f out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh [Place of Rest] , and go to the land of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength]."
Judges,21,22,"And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for you 2f did not give unto them at this time, [that] you 2f should be guilty."
Judges,21,23,"And the children of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] did so, and took [them] wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them."
Judges,21,24,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] departed there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance."
Judges,21,25,In those days [there was] no king in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : every man did [that which was] right in his own eyes.
