Joshua,1,1,"Now after the death of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] the servant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) it came to pass, that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Nun [Posterity] , Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] ’ minister, saying,"
Joshua,1,2,"Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Yarden [Descender] , you i , and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, [even] to the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,1,3,"Every place that the sole of your foot shall trample upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Joshua,1,4,"From the wilderness and this L’vanon [Whiteness] even unto the great river, the river Euphrates (to break forth, to gush) , all the land of the Hitti [Terrorists] , and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast."
Joshua,1,5,"There shall not any man be able to stand before you i all the days of you i life: as I was with Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters], [so] I will be with you i : I will not fail you i , nor forsake you i."
Joshua,1,6,"Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shall you i divide for an inheritance the land, which I swore unto their fathers to give them."
Joshua,1,7,"Only be you i strong and very courageous, that you i may observe to do according to all the law, which Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] my servant commanded you i : turn not from it [to] the right hand or [to] the left, that you i may prosper to wherever you i go."
Joshua,1,8,"This book of the law shall not depart out of your i mouth; but you i shall meditate in it day and night, that you i may observe to do according to all that is written in it: for then you i shall make you i way prosperous, and then you i shall have good success."
Joshua,1,9,"Have not I commanded you i ? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be you i dismayed: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is] with you i to wherever you i go."
Joshua,1,10,"Then Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] commanded the officers of the people, saying,"
Joshua,1,11,"Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals (food for humans) ; for within three days you 2f shall pass over this Yarden [Descender] , to go in to possess the land, which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] gives you to possess it."
Joshua,1,12,"And to the Re’uveni [behold, a son!] , and to the Gadi [my fortune] [A Troop] , and to half the tribe of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , spoke Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , saying,"
Joshua,1,13,"Remember the word which Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] the servant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded you, saying, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has given you rest, and has given you this land."
Joshua,1,14,"Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] gave you on this side Yarden [Descender] ; but you 2f shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;"
Joshua,1,15,"Until the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have given your brethren rest, as [he has given] you, and they also have possessed the land which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] gives them: then you 2f shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] servant gave you on this side Yarden [Descender] toward the sunrising."
Joshua,1,16,"And they answered Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , saying, All that you i command us we will do, and to wherever you i send us, we will go."
Joshua,1,17,"According as we listened unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] in all things, so will we hearken unto you i : only the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] be with you i , as he was with Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Joshua,1,18,"Whosoever [he be] that does rebel against your i commandment, and will not hearken unto your i words in all that you i command him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage."
Joshua,2,1,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Nun [Posterity] sent out of Sheetim [The Acacias] two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Yericho [Its Moon] . And they went, and came into an prostitute’s house, named Rachav [Wide] , and lodged there."
Joshua,2,2,"And it was told the king of Yericho [Its Moon] , saying, Behold, there came men in here to night of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to search out the country."
Joshua,2,3,"And the king of Yericho [Its Moon] sent unto Rachav [Wide] , saying, Bring forth the men that are come to you i , which are entered into you i house: for they be come to search out all the country."
Joshua,2,4,"And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I did not know not from what place they [were]:"
Joshua,2,5,"And it came to pass [about the time] of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: to which the men went I know not: pursue after them quickly; for you 2f shall overtake them."
Joshua,2,6,"But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof."
Joshua,2,7,"And the men pursued after them the way to Yarden [Descender] unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate."
Joshua,2,8,"And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;"
Joshua,2,9,"And she said unto the men, I know that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you."
Joshua,2,10,"For we have heard how the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when you 2f came out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ; and what you 2f did unto the two kings of the Emori [Highlanders] , that [were] on the other side Yarden [Descender] , Sichon [Warrior] and ‘Og [Long-necked] , whom you 2f utterly destroyed."
Joshua,2,11,"And as soon as we had heard [these things] , our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , he [is] God-Elōhīm Bashamayim [The Living Word of GOD in Heaven] above, and in earth beneath."
Joshua,2,12,"Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , since I have showed you kindness, that you 2f will also show kindness unto my father’s house, and give me a true token:"
Joshua,2,13,"And [that] you 2f will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death."
Joshua,2,14,"And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if you 2f utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you i."
Joshua,2,15,"Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house [was] upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall."
Joshua,2,16,"And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may you 2f go your way."
Joshua,2,17,"And the men said unto her, We [will be] blameless of this you i oath which you i have made us swear."
Joshua,2,18,"Behold, [when] we come into the land, you i shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which you i did let us down by: and you i shall bring you i father, and you i mother, and you i brethren, and all you i father’s household, home unto you i."
Joshua,2,19,"And it shall be, [that] whosoever shall go out of the doors of you i house into the street, his blood [shall be] upon his head, and we [will be] guiltless: and whosoever shall be with you i in the house, his blood [shall be] on our head, if [any] hand be upon him."
Joshua,2,20,"And if you i utter this our business, then we will be quit (acquitted; found not guilty) of you i oath which you i have made us to swear."
Joshua,2,21,"And she said, According unto your words, so [be] it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window."
Joshua,2,22,"And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought [them] throughout all the way, but found [them] not."
Joshua,2,23,"So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Nun [Posterity] , and told him all [things] that befell them:"
Joshua,2,24,"And they said unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , Truly the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us."
Joshua,3,1,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] rose early in the morning; and they removed from Sheetim [The Acacias] , and came to Yarden [Descender] , he and all the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and lodged there before they passed over."
Joshua,3,2,"And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;"
Joshua,3,3,"And they commanded the people, saying, When you 2f see the ark of the covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and the priests the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] bearing it, then you 2f shall remove from your place, and go after it."
Joshua,3,4,"Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that you 2f may know the way by which you 2f must go: for you 2f have not passed [this] way heretofore."
Joshua,3,5,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] said unto the people, Sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) yourselves: for tomorrow the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will do wonders among you."
Joshua,3,6,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] spoke unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people."
Joshua,3,7,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , This day will I begin to magnify you i in the sight of all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that they may know that, as I was with Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters], [so] I will be with you i."
Joshua,3,8,"And you i shall command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you 2f are come to the brink of the water of Yarden [Descender] , you 2f shall stand still in Yarden [Descender]."
Joshua,3,9,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] said unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Come here, and hear the words of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Joshua,3,10,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] said, Hereby you 2f shall know that the living God-El Chai [is] among you, and [that] he will without fail drive out from before you the Kena’ani [Merchant] , and the Hitti [Terrorists] , and the Hivi [Villagers] , and the P’rizi [Dwellers in Unwalled Towns] , and the Girgashi [Dwelling on Clay Soil] , and the Emori [Highlanders] , and the Y’vusi [Threshers, Trampled Under Foot]."
Joshua,3,11,"Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord-Adon of all the earth passes over before you into Yarden [Descender]."
Joshua,3,12,"Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , out of every tribe a man."
Joshua,3,13,"And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Yarden [Descender], [that] the waters of Yarden [Descender] shall be cut off [from] the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap."
Joshua,3,14,"And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Yarden [Descender] , and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;"
Joshua,3,15,"And as they that bore the ark were come unto Yarden [Descender] , and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Yarden [Descender] overflows all his banks all the time of harvest,)"
Joshua,3,16,"That the waters which came down from above stood [and] rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam (Man, ground; red; earthling) , that [is] beside Tzartan [Their Distress] : and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, [even] the salt sea, failed, [and] were cut off: and the people passed over right against Yericho [Its Moon]."
Joshua,3,17,"And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Yarden [Descender] , and all the Yisra’eli’s passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Yarden [Descender]."
Joshua,4,1,"And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Yarden [Descender] , that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , saying,"
Joshua,4,2,"Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,"
Joshua,4,3,"And command you 2f them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Yarden [Descender] , out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and you 2f shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where you 2f shall lodge this night."
Joshua,4,4,"Then Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , out of every tribe a man:"
Joshua,4,5,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] into the midst of Yarden [Descender] , and take you 2f up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]:"
Joshua,4,6,"That this may be a sign among you, [that] when your children ask [their fathers] in time to come, saying, What [mean] you 2f by these stones?"
Joshua,4,7,"Then you 2f shall answer them, That the waters of Yarden [Descender] were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; when it passed over Yarden [Descender] , the waters of Yarden [Descender] were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] forever."
Joshua,4,8,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did so as Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Yarden [Descender] , as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , according to the number of the tribes of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there."
Joshua,4,9,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] set up twelve stones in the midst of Yarden [Descender] , in the place where the feet of the priests which bore the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day."
Joshua,4,10,"For the priests which bore the ark stood in the midst of Yarden [Descender] , until everything was finished that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] to speak unto the people, according to all that Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] commanded Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] : and the people hasted and passed over."
Joshua,4,11,"And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people."
Joshua,4,12,"And the children of Re’uven [Behold a Son] , and the children of Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] , and half the tribe of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , passed over armed before the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , as Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] spoke unto them:"
Joshua,4,13,"About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto battle, to the plains of Yericho [Its Moon]."
Joshua,4,14,"On that day the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) magnified Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] in the sight of all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and they feared him, as they feared Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , all the days of his life."
Joshua,4,15,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , saying,"
Joshua,4,16,"Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Yarden [Descender]."
Joshua,4,17,"Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come you 2f up out of Yarden [Descender]."
Joshua,4,18,"And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) were come up out of the midst of Yarden [Descender], [and] the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Yarden [Descender] returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as [they did] before."
Joshua,4,19,"And the people came up out of Yarden [Descender] on the tenth [day] of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] , in the east border of Yericho [Its Moon]."
Joshua,4,20,"And those twelve stones, which they took out of Yarden [Descender] , did Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] pitch in Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling]."
Joshua,4,21,"And he spoke unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What [mean] these stones?"
Joshua,4,22,"Then you 2f shall let your children know, saying, Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] came over this Yarden [Descender] on dry land."
Joshua,4,23,"For the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] dried up the waters of Yarden [Descender] from before you, until you 2f were passed over, as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:"
Joshua,4,24,"That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that it [is] mighty: that you 2f might fear the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] forever."
Joshua,5,1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Emori [Highlanders] , which [were] on the side of Yarden [Descender] westward, and all the kings of the Kena’ani [Merchant] , which [were] by the sea, heard that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had dried up the waters of Yarden [Descender] from before the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them anymore, because of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,5,2,"At that time the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , Make you i sharp knives, and circumcise again the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] the second time."
Joshua,5,3,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] made him sharp knives, and circumcised the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] at the hill of the foreskins."
Joshua,5,4,"And this [is] the cause why Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] did circumcise: All the people that came out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place], [that were] males, [even] all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
Joshua,5,5,"Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people [that were] born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place], [them] they had not circumcised."
Joshua,5,6,"For the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people [that were] men of war, which came out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : unto whom the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) swore that he would not show them the land, which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) swore unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that flows with milk and honey."
Joshua,5,7,"And their children, [whom] he raised up in their stead, them Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way."
Joshua,5,8,"And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole."
Joshua,5,9,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , This day have I rolled away the reproach (disgrace; shame) of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] from off you. For what reason the name of the place is called Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] unto this day."
Joshua,5,10,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] encamped in Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] , and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Yericho [Its Moon]."
Joshua,5,11,"And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the Passover, unleavened cakes, and parched [corn] in the selfsame day."
Joshua,5,12,And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] manna anymore; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Kena’an [Merchant] that year.
Joshua,5,13,"And it came to pass, when Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] was by Yericho [Its Moon] , that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] went unto him, and said unto him, [Are] you i for us, or for our adversaries?"
Joshua,5,14,"And he said, No; but [as] Captain of the Host [Army] of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) am I now come. And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What says my lord Adon [Ruler of the Earth] unto his servant?"
Joshua,5,15,"And the captain of the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] host said unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , Loose you i shoe from off you i foot; for the place whereon you i stand [is] holy. And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] did so."
Joshua,6,1,"Now Yericho [Its Moon] was straitly shut up because of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : none went out, and none came in."
Joshua,6,2,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , See, I have given into you i hand Yericho [Its Moon] , and the king thereof, [and] the mighty men of valour."
Joshua,6,3,"And you 2f shall compass (go around, encircle; encompass) the city, all [you 2f ] men of war, [and] go round about the city once. Thus shall you i do six days."
Joshua,6,4,"And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams’ horns: and the seventh day you 2f shall compass (go around, encircle; encompass) the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets."
Joshua,6,5,"And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long [blast] with the ram’s horn, [and] when you 2f hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him."
Joshua,6,6,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Nun [Posterity] called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Joshua,6,7,"And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass (go around, encircle; encompass) the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Joshua,6,8,"And it came to pass, when Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns passed on before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) followed them."
Joshua,6,9,"And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, [the priests] going on, and blowing with the trumpets."
Joshua,6,10,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] had commanded the people, saying, You 2f shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall [any] word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall you 2f shout."
Joshua,6,11,"So the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) compassed the city, going about [it] once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp."
Joshua,6,12,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Joshua,6,13,"And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rear guard came after the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [the priests] going on, and blowing with the trumpets."
Joshua,6,14,"And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days."
Joshua,6,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times."
Joshua,6,16,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] said unto the people, Shout; for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has given you the city."
Joshua,6,17,"And the city shall be accursed, [even] it, and all that [are] in it, to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : only Rachav [Wide] the prostitute shall live, she and all that [are] with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent."
Joshua,6,18,"And you 2f , in any wise keep [yourselves] from the accursed thing, lest you 2f make [yourselves] accursed, when you 2f take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] a curse, and trouble it."
Joshua,6,19,"But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, [are] consecrated unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : they shall come into the treasury of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Joshua,6,20,"So the people shouted when [the priests] blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city."
Joshua,6,21,"And they utterly destroyed all that [was] in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword."
Joshua,6,22,"But Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the prostitute’s house, and bring out there the woman, and all that she has, as you 2f swore unto her."
Joshua,6,23,"And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rachav [Wide] , and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her family, and left them without the camp of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,6,24,"And they burnt the city with fire, and all that [was] in it: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Joshua,6,25,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] saved Rachav [Wide] the prostitute alive, and her father’s household, and all that she had; and she dwells in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [even] unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] sent to spy out Yericho [Its Moon]."
Joshua,6,26,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] adjured [them] at that time, saying, Cursed [be] the man before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that rises up and builds this city Yericho [It’s Moon] : he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest [son] shall he set up the gates of it."
Joshua,6,27,So the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was with Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] ; and his fame was [noised] throughout all the country.
Joshua,7,1,"But the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for ‘Akhan [Troubler] , the son of Karmi [Fruitful, Noble] , the son of Zavdi [Endowment] , the son of Zerach [Rising] , of the tribe of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was kindled against the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,7,2,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] sent men from Yericho [Its Moon] to ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] , which [is] beside Beit-On [vanity] [house of vanity] , on the east side of Beit-El [House of God] , and spoke unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins]."
Joshua,7,3,"And they returned to Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins]; [and] make not all the people to labour there; for they [are but] few."
Joshua,7,4,So there went up there of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins].
Joshua,7,5,"And the men of ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] struck of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them [from] before the gate [even] unto Sh’varim [the breaches] , and struck them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water."
Joshua,7,6,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) until the eventide, he and the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and put dust upon their heads."
Joshua,7,7,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] said, Alas, O Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , wherefore have you i at all brought this people over Yarden [Descender] , to deliver us into the hand of the Emori [Highlanders] , to destroy us? would to God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Yarden [Descender]!"
Joshua,7,8,"O Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] , what shall I say, when Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] turns their backs before their enemies!"
Joshua,7,9,"For the Kena’ani [Merchant] and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear [of it] , and shall environ (surround; compass) us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what will you i do unto you i great name?"
Joshua,7,10,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , Get you i up; wherefore lay you i thus upon you i face?"
Joshua,7,11,"Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] has sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled (used deceit; pretended; feigned) also, and they have put [it] even among their own stuff."
Joshua,7,12,"Therefore the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] could not stand before their enemies, [but] turned [their] backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except you 2f destroy the accursed from among you."
Joshua,7,13,"Up, sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) the people, and say, Sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) yourselves against tomorrow: for thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [There is] an accursed thing in the midst of you i , O Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : you i cannot stand before you i enemies, until you 2f take away the accursed thing from among you."
Joshua,7,14,"In the morning therefore you 2f shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, [that] the tribe which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) takes shall come according to the families [thereof] ; and the family which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall take shall come by households; and the household which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall take shall come man by man."
Joshua,7,15,"And it shall be, [that] he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has: because he has transgressed the covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and because he has wrought folly in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,7,16,"So Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] rose up early in the morning, and brought Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] by their tribes; and the tribe of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] was taken:"
Joshua,7,17,And he brought the family of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ; and he took the family of the Zarchi: and he brought the family of the Zarchi man by man; and Zavdi [Endowment] was taken:
Joshua,7,18,"And he brought his household man by man; and ‘Akhan [Troubler] , the son of Karmi [Fruitful, Noble] , the son of Zavdi [Endowment] , the son of Zerach [Rising] , of the tribe of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , was taken."
Joshua,7,19,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] said unto ‘Akhan [Troubler] , My son, give, I pray you i , glory to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and make confession unto him; and tell me now what you i have done; hide [it] not from me."
Joshua,7,20,"And ‘Akhan [Troubler] answered Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , and said, Indeed I have sinned against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and thus and thus have I done:"
Joshua,7,21,"When I saw among the spoils a goodly Shin’ar (Babylonian) garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they [are] hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it."
Joshua,7,22,"So Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, [it was] hid in his tent, and the silver under it."
Joshua,7,23,"And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , and unto all the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and laid them out before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Joshua,7,24,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with him, took ‘Akhan [Troubler] the son of Zerach [Rising] , and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Akhor [Trouble]."
Joshua,7,25,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] said, Why have you i troubled us? the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall trouble you i this day. And all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones."
Joshua,7,26,"And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) turned from the fierceness of his anger. For what reason the name of that place was called, The valley of Akhor [Trouble] , unto this day."
Joshua,8,1,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , Fear not, neither be you i dismayed: take all the people of war with you i , and arise, go up to ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] : see, I have given into you i hand the king of ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] , and his people, and his city, and his land:"
Joshua,8,2,"And you i shall do to ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] and her king as you i did unto Yericho [Its Moon] and her king: only the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall you 2f take for a prey unto yourselves: lay you i an ambush for the city behind it."
Joshua,8,3,"So Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] arose, and all the people of war, to go up against ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] : and Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night."
Joshua,8,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Behold, you 2f shall lie in wait against the city, [even] behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be you 2f all ready:"
Joshua,8,5,"And I, and all the people that [are] with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,"
Joshua,8,6," (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them."
Joshua,8,7,"Then you 2f shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] will deliver it into your hand."
Joshua,8,8,"And it shall be, when you 2f have taken the city, [that] you 2f shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall you 2f do. See, I have commanded you."
Joshua,8,9,"Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Beit-El [House of God] and ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] , on the west side of ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] : but Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] lodged that night among the people."
Joshua,8,10,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , before the people to ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins]."
Joshua,8,11,"And all the people, [even the people] of war that [were] with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] : now [there was] a valley between them and ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins]."
Joshua,8,12,"And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Beit-El [House of God] and ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] , on the west side of the city."
Joshua,8,13,"And when they had set the people, [even] all the host that [was] on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] went that night into the midst of the valley."
Joshua,8,14,"And it came to pass, when the king of ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] saw [it] , that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he did not know not that [there were] liers in ambush against him behind the city."
Joshua,8,15,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness."
Joshua,8,16,"And all the people that [were] in ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , and were drawn away from the city."
Joshua,8,17,"And there was not a man left in ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] or Beit-El [House of God] , that went not out after Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and they left the city open, and pursued after Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,8,18,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , Stretch out the spear that [is] in you i hand toward ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] ; for I will give it into you i hand. And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] stretched out the spear that [he had] in his hand toward the city."
Joshua,8,19,"And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire."
Joshua,8,20,"And when the men of ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers."
Joshua,8,21,"And when Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and killed the men of ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins]."
Joshua,8,22,"And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , some on this side, and some on that side: and they struck them, so that they let none of them remain or escape."
Joshua,8,23,"And the king of ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] they took alive, and brought him to Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation]."
Joshua,8,24,"And it came to pass, when Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Yisra’eli’s returned unto ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] , and struck it with the edge of the sword."
Joshua,8,25,"And [so] it was, [that] all that fell that day, both of men and women, [were] twelve thousand, [even] all the men of ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins]."
Joshua,8,26,"For Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] drew not his hand back, which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins]."
Joshua,8,27,"Only the cattle and the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) of that city Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) which he commanded Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation]."
Joshua,8,28,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] burnt ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] , and made it an heap forever, [even] a desolation unto this day."
Joshua,8,29,"And the king of ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] commanded that they should take his carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, [that remains] unto this day."
Joshua,8,30,"Then Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] built an altar unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in mount ‘Eival [Stone],"
Joshua,8,31,"As Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] the servant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , as it is written in the book of the law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , an altar of whole stones, over which no man has lift up [any] iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and sacrificed peace offerings."
Joshua,8,32,"And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , which he wrote in the presence of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,8,33,"And all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] , which bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount G’rizim [Cuttings Off] , and half of them over against mount ‘Eival [Stone] ; as Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] the servant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,8,34,"And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law."
Joshua,8,35,"There was not a word of all that Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] commanded, which Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] read not before all the congregation of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them."
Joshua,9,1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings which [were] on this side Yarden [Descender] , in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against L’vanon [Whiteness] , the Hitti [Terrorists] , and the Emori [Rebellious Highlanders] , the Kena’ani [Merchants] , the P’rizi [Villagers] , the Hivi [Wicked Villagers] , and the Y’vusi [Threshers] , heard [thereof];"
Joshua,9,2,"That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] and with Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , with one accord."
Joshua,9,3,"And when the inhabitants of Giv’on [Hill City] heard what Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] had done unto Yericho [Its Moon] and to ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins],"
Joshua,9,4,"They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;"
Joshua,9,5,"And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry [and] mouldy."
Joshua,9,6,"And they went to Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] unto the camp at Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] , and said unto him, and to the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , We be come from a far country: now therefore make you 2f a league with us."
Joshua,9,7,"And the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] said unto the Hivi [Villagers] , Perhaps you 2f dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?"
Joshua,9,8,"And they said unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , We [are] you i servants. And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] said unto them, Who [are] you 2f ? and from what place come you 2f?"
Joshua,9,9,"And they said unto him, From a very far country you i servants are come because of the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place],"
Joshua,9,10,"And all that he did to the two kings of the Emori [Highlanders] , that [were] beyond Yarden [Descender] , to Sichon [Warrior] king of Heshbon [Stronghold] , and to ‘Og [Long-necked] king of Bashan [Fruitful] , which [was] at ‘Ashtarot [Star (female deity)]."
Joshua,9,11,"For what reason our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take victuals (food for humans) with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We [are] your servants: therefore now make you 2f a league with us."
Joshua,9,12,"This our bread we took hot [for] our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:"
Joshua,9,13,"And these bottles of wine, which we filled, [were] new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey."
Joshua,9,14,"And the men took of their victuals (food for humans) , and asked not [counsel] at the mouth of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Joshua,9,15,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation swore unto them."
Joshua,9,16,"And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they [were] their neighbours, and [that] they dwelt among them."
Joshua,9,17,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities [were] Giv’on [Hill City] , and K’firah [Lioness] , and B’erot [Wells] , and Kiryat-Ye’arim [City of Forests]."
Joshua,9,18,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] struck them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] . And all the congregation murmured against the princes."
Joshua,9,19,"But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : now therefore we may not touch them."
Joshua,9,20,"This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we swore unto them."
Joshua,9,21,"And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them."
Joshua,9,22,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] called for them, and he spoke unto them, saying, For what reason have you 2f beguiled us, saying, We [are] very far from you; when you 2f dwell among us?"
Joshua,9,23,"Now therefore you 2f [are] cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Joshua,9,24,"And they answered Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , and said, Because it was certainly told you i servants, how that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] commanded his servant Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing."
Joshua,9,25,"And now, behold, we [are] in you i hand: as it seems good and right unto you i to do unto us, do."
Joshua,9,26,"And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that they killed them not."
Joshua,9,27,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , even unto this day, in the place which he should choose."
Joshua,10,1,"Now it came to pass, when Adoni-Tzedek [My lord is Righteous] king of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] had heard how Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] had taken ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] , and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Yericho [Its Moon] and her king, so he had done to ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] and her king; and how the inhabitants of Giv’on [Hill City] had made peace with Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and were among them;"
Joshua,10,2,"That they feared greatly, because Giv’on [Hill City] [was] a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it [was] greater than ‘Ai [Heap of Ruins] , and all the men thereof [were] mighty."
Joshua,10,3,"For what reason Adoni-Tzedek [My lord is Righteous] king of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] sent unto Hoham [Whom Yehovah impels] king of Hevron [Seat of Association] , and unto Piram king of Yarmut [Heights] , and unto Yafia [Shining] king of Lakhish [Invincible] , and unto D’vir [Sanctuary] king of ‘Eglon [Calf-like] , saying,"
Joshua,10,4,"Come up unto me, and help me, that we may strike Giv’on [Hill City] : for it has made peace with Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] and with the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,10,5,"Therefore the five kings of the Emori [Highlanders] , the king of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , the king of Hevron [Seat of Association] , the king of Yarmut [Heights] , the king of Lakhish [Invincible] , the king of ‘Eglon [Calf-like] , gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Giv’on [Hill City] , and made war against it."
Joshua,10,6,"And the men of Giv’on [Hill City] sent unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] to the camp to Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] , saying, Slack not you i hand from you i servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Emori [Highlanders] that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us."
Joshua,10,7,"So Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] ascended from Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] , he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour."
Joshua,10,8,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , Fear them not: for I have delivered them into you i hand; there shall not a man of them stand before you i."
Joshua,10,9,"Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] therefore came unto them suddenly, [and] went up from Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] all night."
Joshua,10,10,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) scattered (defeated in battle) them before Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and killed them with a great slaughter at Giv’on [Hill City] , and chased them along the way that goes up to Beit-Horon [House of Hollowness] , and struck them to ‘Azekah [Dug Over] , and unto Makkedah [Place of Shepherds]."
Joshua,10,11,"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [and] were in the going down to Beit-Horon [House of Hollowness] , that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto ‘Azekah [Dug Over] , and they died: [they were] more which died with hailstones than [they] whom the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] killed with the sword."
Joshua,10,12,"Then spoke Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in the day when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) delivered up the Emori [Highlanders] before the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and he said in the sight of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Sun, stand you i still upon Giv’on [Hill City] ; and you i , Moon, in the valley of Ayalon [Field of Deer]."
Joshua,10,13,"And the sun stood still, and the moon detained (held) , until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. [Is] not this written in the book of Yahsar [Upright, Correct] ? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day."
Joshua,10,14,"And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) listened unto the voice of a man: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) fought for Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,10,15,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] returned, and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with him, unto the camp to Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling]."
Joshua,10,16,"But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah [Place of Shepherds]."
Joshua,10,17,"And it was told Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah [Place of Shepherds]."
Joshua,10,18,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:"
Joshua,10,19,"And stay you 2f not, [but] pursue after your enemies, and strike the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has delivered them into your hand."
Joshua,10,20,"And it came to pass, when Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] and the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest [which] remained of them entered into fenced cities."
Joshua,10,21,And all the people returned to the camp to Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] at Makkedah [Place of Shepherds] in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
Joshua,10,22,"Then said Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave."
Joshua,10,23,"And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , the king of Hevron [Seat of Association] , the king of Yarmut [Heights] , the king of Lakhish [Invincible], [and] the king of ‘Eglon [Calf-like]."
Joshua,10,24,"And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , that Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] called for all the men of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them."
Joshua,10,25,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) do to all your enemies against whom you 2f fight."
Joshua,10,26,"And afterward Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] struck them, and killed them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening."
Joshua,10,27,"And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, [that] Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave’s mouth, [which remain] until this very day."
Joshua,10,28,"And that day Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] took Makkedah [Place of Shepherds] , and struck it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that [were] in it; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah [Place of Shepherds] as he did unto the king of Yericho [Its Moon]."
Joshua,10,29,"Then Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] passed from Makkedah [Place of Shepherds] , and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with him, unto Livnah [Pavement] , and fought against Livnah [Pavement]:"
Joshua,10,30,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and he struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that [were] in it; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Yericho [Its Moon]."
Joshua,10,31,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] passed from Livnah [Pavement] , and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with him, unto Lakhish [Invincible] , and encamped against it, and fought against it:"
Joshua,10,32,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) delivered Lakhish [Invincible] into the hand of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , which took it on the second day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that [were] in it, according to all that he had done to Livnah [Pavement]."
Joshua,10,33,"Then Horam king of Gezer [Portion] came up to help Lakhish [Invincible] ; and Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] struck him and his people, until he had left him none remaining."
Joshua,10,34,"And from Lakhish [Invincible] Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] passed unto ‘Eglon [Calf-like] , and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:"
Joshua,10,35,"And they took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that [were] in it he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lakhish [Invincible]."
Joshua,10,36,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] went up from ‘Eglon [Calf-like] , and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with him, unto Hevron [Seat of Association] ; and they fought against it:"
Joshua,10,37,"And they took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that [were] in it; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to ‘Eglon [Calf-like] ; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that [were] in it."
Joshua,10,38,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] returned, and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with him, to D’vir [Sanctuary] ; and fought against it:"
Joshua,10,39,"And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that [were] in it; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hevron [Seat of Association] , so he did to D’vir [Sanctuary] , and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Livnah [Pavement] , and to her king."
Joshua,10,40,"So Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] struck all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] commanded."
Joshua,10,41,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] struck them from Kadesh [Holy] -Barnea [Holy] even unto ‘Azah [The Strong] , and all the country of Goshen [Drawing Near] , even unto Giv’on [Hill City]."
Joshua,10,42,"And all these kings and their land did Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] take at one time, because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] fought for Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,10,43,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] returned, and all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with him, unto the camp to Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling]."
Joshua,11,1,"And it came to pass, when Yavin [Whom God Observes] king of Hatzor [Castle] had heard [those things] , that he sent to Yovav [A Desert] king of Madon [Strife] , and to the king of Shimron [Watch-Height] , and to the king of Akhshaf [I Shall be Bewitched],"
Joshua,11,2,"And to the kings that [were] on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Kinn’rot [Harps] , and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor [Generation] on the west,"
Joshua,11,3," [And to] the Kena’ani [Merchants] on the east and on the west, and [to] the Emori [Rebellious Highlanders] , and the Hitti [Terrorists] , and the P’rizi [Villagers] , and the Y’vusi [Threshers] in the mountains, and [to] the Hivi [Wicked Villagers] under Hermon [A Sanctuary] in the land of Mitzpah [Watchtower]."
Joshua,11,4,"And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that [is] upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many."
Joshua,11,5,"And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom [High Place] , to fight against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,11,6,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , Be not afraid because of them: for tomorrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : you i shall hough (hamstring; cut the tendons of the ham) their horses, and burn their chariots with fire."
Joshua,11,7,"So Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom [High Place] suddenly; and they fell upon them."
Joshua,11,8,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) delivered them into the hand of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , who struck them, and chased them unto great Tzidon [Hunting] , and unto Misrefot-Mayim [Burnings of Water] , and unto the valley of Mitzpah [Watchtower] eastward; and they struck them, until they left them none remaining."
Joshua,11,9,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] did unto them as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) bade him: he hamstringed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire."
Joshua,11,10,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] at that time turned back, and took Hatzor [Castle] , and struck the king thereof with the sword: for Hatzor [Castle] formerly was the head of all those kingdoms."
Joshua,11,11,"And they struck all the souls that [were] in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying [them] : there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hatzor [Castle] with fire."
Joshua,11,12,"And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] take, and struck them with the edge of the sword, [and] he utterly destroyed them, as Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] the servant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded."
Joshua,11,13,"But [as for] the cities that stood still in their strength, Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] burned none of them, save Hatzor [Castle] only; [that] did Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] burn."
Joshua,11,14,"And all the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) of these cities, and the cattle, the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe."
Joshua,11,15,"As the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] his servant, so did Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] command Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , and so did Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] ; he left nothing undone of all that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Joshua,11,16,"So Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen [Drawing Near] , and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and the valley of the same;"
Joshua,11,17," [Even] from the mount Halak [Smooth] , that goes up to Se’ir [Shaggy] , even unto Ba’al-Gad [lord of Fortune] in the valley of L’vanon [Whiteness] under mount Hermon [A Sanctuary] : and all their kings he took, and struck them, and killed them."
Joshua,11,18,Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] made war a long time with all those kings.
Joshua,11,19,"There was not a city that made peace with the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , save the Hivi [Villagers] the inhabitants of Giv’on [Hill City] : all [other] they took in battle."
Joshua,11,20,"For it was of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to harden their hearts, that they should come against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, [and] that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Joshua,11,21,"And at that time came Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , and cut off the ‘Anakim [Longed-Necked] from the mountains, from Hevron [Seat of Association] , from D’vir [Sanctuary] , from ‘Anav [Fruit] , and from all the mountains of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and from all the mountains of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] destroyed them utterly with their cities."
Joshua,11,22,"There was none of the ‘Anakim [Longed-Necked] left in the land of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : only in ‘Azah [The Strong] , in Gat [Winepress] , and in Ashdod [powerful] , there remained."
Joshua,11,23,"So Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] took the whole land, according to all that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] ; and Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] gave it for an inheritance unto Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war."
Joshua,12,1,"Now these [are] the kings of the land, which the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] struck, and possessed their land on the other side Yarden [Descender] toward the rising of the sun, from the river ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] unto mount Hermon [A Sanctuary] , and all the plain on the east:"
Joshua,12,2,"Sichon [Warrior] king of the Emori [Highlanders] , who dwelt in Heshbon [Stronghold], [and] ruled from ‘Aeo’er [Ruins] , which [is] upon the bank of the river ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] , and from the middle of the river, and from half Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , even unto the river Yabok [luxuriant emptying river], [which is] the border of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred];"

Joshua,13,29,And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] gave [inheritance] unto the half tribe of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] : and [this] was [the possession] of the half tribe of the children of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] by their families.
Joshua,13,30,"And their coast was from Machanayim [Two Camps] , all Bashan [Fruitful] , all the kingdom of ‘Og [Long-necked] king of Bashan [Fruitful] , and all the towns of Ya’ir [He Enlightens] , which [are] in Bashan [Fruitful] , threescore cities:"
Joshua,13,31,"And half Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , and ‘Ashtarot [Star (female deity)] , and Edre’i [Good Pasture] , cities of the kingdom of ‘Og [Long-necked] in Bashan [Fruitful], [were pertaining] unto the children of Makhir [Sold] the son of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget], [even] to the one half of the children of Makhir [Sold] by their families."
Joshua,13,32,"These [are the countries] which Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , on the other side Yarden [Descender] , by Yericho [Its Moon] , eastward."
Joshua,13,33,"But unto the tribe of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] gave not [any] inheritance: the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [was] their inheritance, as he said unto them."
Joshua,14,1,"And these [are the countries] which the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] inherited in the land of Kena’an [Merchant] , which El’azar [God has helped] the priest, and Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Nun [Posterity] , and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , distributed for inheritance to them."
Joshua,14,2,"By lot [was] their inheritance, as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded by the hand of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , for the nine tribes, and [for] the half tribe."
Joshua,14,3,For Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Yarden [Descender] : but unto the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] he gave none inheritance among them.
Joshua,14,4,"For the children of Yosef [ (God) He Shall Add] were two tribes, M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] and Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] : therefore they gave no part unto the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] in the land, save cities to dwell [in] , with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance."
Joshua,14,5,"As the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , so the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did, and they divided the land."
Joshua,14,6,"Then the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] came unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] in Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] : and Kalev [Dog] the son of Y’funeh [He Will Face] the K’nizi [The Sons of this purchase; this lamentation] said unto him, you i know the thing that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] the man of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] concerning me and you i in Kadesh [Holy] -Barnea [Holy]."
Joshua,14,7,Forty years old [was] I when Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] the servant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent me from Kadesh [Holy] -Barnea [Holy] to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as [it was] in my heart.
Joshua,14,8,Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered].
Joshua,14,9,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] swore on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon you i feet have trampled shall be you i inheritance, and you i children’s forever, because you i have wholly followed the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Joshua,14,10,"And now, behold, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke this word unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , while [the children of] Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I [am] this day eighty and five years old."
Joshua,14,11,"As yet I [am as] strong this day as [I was] in the day that Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] sent me: as my strength [was] then, even so [is] my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in."
Joshua,14,12,"Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke in that day; for you i heard in that day how the ‘Anakim [Longed-Necked] [were] there, and [that] the cities [were] great [and] fenced: if so be the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [will be] with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said."
Joshua,14,13,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) him, and gave unto Kalev [Dog] the son of Y’funeh [He Will Face] Hevron [Seat of Association] for an inheritance."
Joshua,14,14,"Hevron [Seat of Association] therefore became the inheritance of Kalev [Dog] the son of Y’funeh [He Will Face] the K’nizi [The Sons of Kenez this purchase; this lamentation] unto this day, because that he wholly followed the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,14,15,And the name of Hevron [Seat of Association] before [was] Kiryat-Arba [City of Arba (four)]; [which Kiryat-Arba [City of Arba (fourth)] was] a great man among the ‘Anakim [Longed-Necked] . And the land had rest from war.
Joshua,15,1, [This] then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] by their families; [even] to the border of Edom [Red] the wilderness of Tzin [Flat] southward [was] the uttermost part of the south coast.
Joshua,15,2,"And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looks southward:"
Joshua,15,3,"And it went out to the south side to the Ascent of Scorpions, and passed along to Tzin [Flat] , and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh [Holy] -Barnea [Holy] , and passed along to Hetzron [surrounded by a wall] , and went up to Adar, and went on a circular course (go around, encircle; encompass) to Karka [Floor]:"
Joshua,15,4," [From there] it passed toward ‘Atzmon [Strong] , and went out unto the river of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast."
Joshua,15,5,"And the east border [was] the salt sea, [even] unto the end of Yarden [Descender] . And [their] border in the north quarter [was] from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Yarden [Descender]:"
Joshua,15,6,"And the border went up to Beit-Hoglah [Partidge] [House of the Partidge] , and passed along by the north of Beit-’Aravah [House of the Desert Valley/Depression] ; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan [Thumb] the son of Re’uven [Behold a Son]:"
Joshua,15,7,"And the border went up toward D’vir [Sanctuary] from the Valley of Akhor [Trouble] , and so northward, looking toward Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] , that [is] before the going up to Ma’alei-Adumim [Ruddy (reddish hair or complexion) one: Quieted ones?], which [is] on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of ‘Ein-Shemesh [Fountain of the Sun] , and the goings out thereof were at ‘Ein-Rogel (a place near Jerusalem) [Fount of the Fuller (washer and/or bleacher of clothes)]:"
Joshua,15,8,"And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom [Lamentation] unto the south side of the Y’vusi [Threshers] ; the same [is] Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : and the border went up to the top of the mountain that [lies] before the valley of Hinnom [Lamentation] westward, which [is] at the end of the valley of the giants northward:"
Joshua,15,9,"And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Neftoach [Opening] , and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Ba’alah [mistress] , which [is] Kiryat-Ye’arim [City of Forests]:"
Joshua,15,10,"And the border compassed from Ba’alah [mistress] westward unto mount Se’ir [Shaggy] , and passed along unto the side of Mount Ye’arim [Forests] , which [is] K’salon [Hopes] , on the north side, and went down to Beit-Shemesh [House of the Sun] , and passed on to Timnah [Portion]:"
Joshua,15,11,"And the border went out unto the side of ‘Ekron [Torn Up by the Roots] northward: and the border was drawn to Shikron [Drunkenness] , and passed along to mount Ba’alah [mistress] , and went out unto Yavne’el [God Causes to Build] ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea."
Joshua,15,12,"And the west border [was] to the great sea, and the coast [thereof] . This [is] the coast of the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] round about according to their families."
Joshua,15,13,"And unto Kalev [Dog] the son of Y’funeh [He Will Face] he gave a part among the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , according to the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation], [even] the Kiryat-Arba [City of Arba (fourth)] the father of Anak [Neck] , which [city is] Hevron [Seat of Association]."
Joshua,15,14,"And Kalev [Dog] drove there the three sons of Anak [Neck] , Sheshai [Noble] , and Achiman [My Brother is a Gift] , and Talmai [Plowman] , the children of Anak [Neck]."
Joshua,15,15,And he went up there to the inhabitants of D’vir [Sanctuary] : and the name of D’vir [Sanctuary] before [was] Kiryat-Sepher [City of the Book].
Joshua,15,16,"And Kalev [Dog] said, He that smites Kiryat-Sepher [City of the Book] , and takes it, to him will I give ‘Akhsah [Anklet] my daughter to wife."
Joshua,15,17,"And ‘Otni’el [Lion of God] the son of K’naz [Hunter] , the brother of Kalev [Dog] , took it: and he gave him ‘Akhsah [Anklet] his daughter to wife."
Joshua,15,18,"And it came to pass, as she came [unto him] , that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off [her] ass; and Kalev [Dog] said unto her, What would you i?"
Joshua,15,19,"Who answered, Give me a blessing; for you i have given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the lower springs."
Joshua,15,20,This [is] the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] according to their families.
Joshua,15,21,"And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] toward the coast of Edom [Red] southward were Kavtze’el [God Gathers] , and ‘Eder [A Flock] , and Yagur [He Sojourns],"

Joshua,16,1,"And the lot of the children of Yosef [ (God) He Shall Add] fell from Yarden [Descender] by Yericho [Its Moon] , unto the water of Yericho [Its Moon] on the east, to the wilderness that goes up from Yericho [Its Moon] throughout mount Beit-El [House of God],"
Joshua,16,2,"And goes out from Beit-El [House of God] to Luz [Almond Tree] , and passes along unto the borders of Arki [Lengthy] to ‘Atarot [Crowns],"

Joshua,16,4,"So the children of Yosef [(God) He Shall Add] , M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] and Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , took their inheritance."
Joshua,16,5,"And the border of the children of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] according to their families was [thus] : even the border of their inheritance on the east side was ‘Atrot-Adar [Crowns of Glory] , unto Beit-Horon [House of Hollowness] the upper;"
Joshua,16,6,"And the border went out toward the sea to Mikhm’tat [Hiding Place] on the north side; and the border went about eastward unto Ta’anat-Shiloh [Approach to Shiloh] , and passed by it on the east to Yanochah [He Rests];"
Joshua,16,7,"And it went down from Yanochah [He Rests] to ‘Atarot [Crowns] , and to Na’arah [Maiden] , and came to Yericho [Its Moon] , and went out at Yarden [Descender]."
Joshua,16,8,The border went out from Tapuach [The Apple City] westward unto the river Kanah [Reed] ; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This [is] the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] by their families.
Joshua,16,9,"And the separate cities for the children of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] [were] among the inheritance of the children of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , all the cities with their villages."
Joshua,16,10,"And they drove not out the Kena’ani [Merchant] that dwelt in Gezer [Portion] : but the Kena’ani [Merchant] dwell among the Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] unto this day, and serve under tribute."
Joshua,17,1,"There was also a lot for the tribe of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] ; for he [was] the firstborn of Yosef [(God) He Shall Add]; [that is to say] , for Makhir [Sold] the firstborn of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , the father of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] : because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gil’ad [Rocky Region] and Bashan [Fruitful]."
Joshua,17,2,"There was also [a lot] for the rest of the children of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] by their families; for the children of Avi-ezer [My Father is Help] , and for the children of Helek [Portion] , and for the children of Asri’el [I Shall Be a Prince with God] , and for the children of Sh’khem [Shoulder] , and for the children of Hefer [A Well] , and for the children of Sh’mida [Wise] : these [were] the male children of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] the son of Yosef [ (God) He Shall Add] by their families."
Joshua,17,3,"But Tz’lof’chad [First-Born] , the son of Hefer [A Well] , the son of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , the son of Makhir [Sold] , the son of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , had no sons, but daughters: and these [are] the names of his daughters, Machlah [Disease] , and No’ah [Motion] , Hoglah [Partidge] , Machlah [Queen] , and Tirtzah [Favourable]."
Joshua,17,4,"And they came near before El’azar [God has helped] the priest, and before Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Nun [Posterity] , and before the princes, saying, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) commanded Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father."
Joshua,17,5,"And there fell ten portions to M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , beside the land of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] and Bashan [Fruitful] , which [were] on the other side Yarden [Descender];"
Joshua,17,6,Because the daughters of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] ’s sons had the land of Gil’ad [Rocky Region].
Joshua,17,7,"And the coast of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] was from Asher [Happy] to Mikhm’tat [Hiding Place] , that [lies] before Sh’khem [Shoulder] ; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of ‘Ein-Tapuach [Fountain of the Apple-City]."
Joshua,17,8, [Now] M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] had the land of Tapuach [The Apple City] : but Tapuach [The Apple City] on the border of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] [belonged] to the children of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful];
Joshua,17,9,"And the coast descended unto the river Kanah [Reed] , southward of the river: these cities of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] [are] among the cities of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] : the coast of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] also [was] on the north side of the river, and the extreme limits of it were at the sea:"
Joshua,17,10,"Southward [it was] Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] ’s, and northward [it was] M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] ’s, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher [Happy] on the north, and in Yissakhar [There Is Recompense] on the east."
Joshua,17,11,"And M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] had in Yissakhar [There Is Recompense] and in Asher [Happy] Beit-Sh’an [House of Ease] and her towns, and Yivle’am [Devouring the People] and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor [Generation] and her towns, and the inhabitants of ‘Ein-Dor [spring of dwelling] and her towns, and the inhabitants of Ta’anakh [Sandy] and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo [Place of Crowds] and her towns, [even] three countries."
Joshua,17,12,Yet the children of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] could not drive out [the inhabitants of] those cities; but the Kena’ani [Merchant] would dwell in that land.
Joshua,17,13,"Yet it came to pass, when the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were waxen strong, that they put the Kena’ani [Merchant] to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out."
Joshua,17,14,"And the children of Yosef [ (God) He Shall Add] spoke unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , saying, Why have you i given me [but] one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I [am] a great people, forasmuch as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) me up to this time?"
Joshua,17,15,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] answered them, If you i [be] a great people, [then] get you i up to the wood [country] , and cut down for yourself there in the land of the P’rizi [Dwellers in Unwalled Towns] and of the giants, if mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] be too narrow for you i."
Joshua,17,16,"And the children of Yosef [ (God) He Shall Add] said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Kena’ani [Merchant] that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, [both they] who [are] of Beit-Sh’an [House of Ease] and her towns, and [they] who [are] of the valley of Yizre’el [God Sows]."
Joshua,17,17,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] spoke unto the house of Yosef [(God) He Shall Add], [even] to Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] and to M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , saying, you i [are] a great people, and have great power: you i shall not have one lot [only]:"
Joshua,17,18,"But the mountain shall be you i ; for it [is] a wood, and you i shall cut it down: and the extreme limits of it shall be you i : for you i shall drive out the Kena’ani [Merchant] , though they have iron chariots, [and] though they [be] strong."
Joshua,18,1,"And the whole congregation of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] assembled together at Shiloh [Place of Rest] , and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them."
Joshua,18,2,"And there remained among the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance."
Joshua,18,3,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] said unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , How long [are] you 2f slack to go to possess the land, which the Yehovah Elohe Avotekhem [The Lord God of your Fathers] has given you?"
Joshua,18,4,"Give out from among you three men for [each] tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come [again] to me."
Joshua,18,5,"And they shall divide it into seven parts: Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Yosef [ (God) He Shall Add] shall abide in their coasts on the north."
Joshua,18,6,"You 2f shall therefore describe the land [into] seven parts, and bring [the description] here to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Joshua,18,7,"But the Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] have no part among you; for the priesthood of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] their inheritance: and Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] , and Re’uven [Behold a Son] , and half the tribe of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , have received their inheritance beyond Yarden [Descender] on the east, which Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] the servant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) gave them."
Joshua,18,8,"And the men arose, and went away: and Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) in Shiloh [Place of Rest]."
Joshua,18,9,"And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came [again] to Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] to the host at Shiloh [Place of Rest]."
Joshua,18,10,And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] cast lots for them in Shiloh [Place of Rest] before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : and there Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] divided the land unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] according to their divisions.

Joshua,22,4,"And now the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return you 2f , and get you unto your tents, [and] unto the land of your possession, which Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] the servant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) gave you on the other side Yarden [Descender]."
Joshua,22,5,"But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] the servant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) charged you, to love the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cling to (hold onto; stick to) him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul."
Joshua,22,6,"So Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents."
Joshua,22,7,"Now to the [one] half of the tribe of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] had given [possession] in Bashan [Fruitful] : but unto the [other] half thereof gave Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] among their brethren on this side Yarden [Descender] westward. And when Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] sent them away also unto their tents, then he Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) them,"
Joshua,22,8,"And he spoke unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much clothing: divide the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) of your enemies with your brethren."
Joshua,22,9,"And the children of Re’uven [Behold a Son] and the children of Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] and the half tribe of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] returned, and departed from the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of Shiloh [Place of Rest] , which [is] in the land of Kena’an [Merchant] , to go unto the country of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) by the hand of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Joshua,22,10,"And when they came unto the borders of Yarden [Descender] , that [are] in the land of Kena’an [Merchant] , the children of Re’uven [Behold a Son] and the children of Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] and the half tribe of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] built there an altar by Yarden [Descender] , a great altar to see to."
Joshua,22,11,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] heard say, Behold, the children of Re’uven [Behold a Son] and the children of Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] and the half tribe of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] have built an altar over against the land of Kena’an [Merchant] , in the borders of Yarden [Descender] , at the passage of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,22,12,"And when the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] heard [of it] , the whole congregation of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] gathered themselves together at Shiloh [Place of Rest] , to go up to war against them."
Joshua,22,13,"And the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] sent unto the children of Re’uven [Behold a Son] , and to the children of Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] , and to the half tribe of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , into the land of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , Pinchas [mouth of brass] the son of El’azar [God has helped] the priest,"
Joshua,22,14,"And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and each one [was] an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,22,15,"And they came unto the children of Re’uven [Behold a Son] , and to the children of Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] , and to the half tribe of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , unto the land of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , and they spoke with them, saying,"
Joshua,22,16,"Thus says the whole congregation of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , What trespass [is] this that you 2f have committed against the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , to turn away this day from following the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , in that you 2f have built you an altar, that you 2f might rebel this day against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)?"
Joshua,22,17," [Is] the iniquity of P’or [Cleft (split hoof; an opening, break or split)] too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate),"
Joshua,22,18,"But that you 2f must turn away this day from following the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ? and it will be, [seeing] you 2f rebel today against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that tomorrow he will be exceedingly angry with the whole congregation of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,22,19,"Yet, if the land of your possession [be] unclean, [then] pass you 2f over unto the land of the possession of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , wherein the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] tabernacle dwells, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Joshua,22,20,"Did not ‘Akhan [Troubler] the son of Zerach [Rising] commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity."
Joshua,22,21,"Then the children of Re’uven [Behold a Son] and the children of Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] and the half tribe of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God],"
Joshua,22,22,"God-El [The Powerful Living Word] ! God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ! Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-El [The Powerful Living Word] ! God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] is Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ! He knows, and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] he shall know; if [it be] in rebellion, or if in transgression against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , don’t save today!"
Joshua,22,23,"That we have built us an altar to turn from following the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) himself require [it];"
Joshua,22,24,"And if we have not [rather] done it for fear of [this] thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have you 2f to do with the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]?"
Joshua,22,25,"For the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has made Yarden [Descender] a border between us and you, you 2f children of Re’uven [Behold a Son] and children of Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] ; you 2f have no part in the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Joshua,22,26,"Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:"
Joshua,22,27,"But [that] it [may be] a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, You 2f have no part in the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Joshua,22,28,"Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should [so] say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say [again] , Behold the pattern of the altar of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it [is] a witness between us and you."
Joshua,22,29,"God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] forbid that we should rebel against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and turn this day from following the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] that [is] before his tabernacle."
Joshua,22,30,"And when Pinchas [mouth of brass] the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] which [were] with him, heard the words that the children of Re’uven [Behold a Son] and the children of Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] and the children of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] spoke, it pleased them."
Joshua,22,31,"And Pinchas [mouth of brass] the son of El’azar [God has helped] the priest said unto the children of Re’uven [Behold a Son] , and to the children of Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] , and to the children of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] , This day we perceive that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] among us, because you 2f have not committed this trespass against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : now you 2f have delivered the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] out of the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Joshua,22,32,"And Pinchas [mouth of brass] the son of El’azar [God has helped] the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Re’uven [Behold a Son] , and from the children of Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] , out of the land of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , unto the land of Kena’an [Merchant] , to the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and brought them word again."
Joshua,22,33,"And the thing pleased the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Re’uven [Behold a Son] and Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] dwelt."
Joshua,22,34,And the children of Re’uven [Behold a Son] and the children of Gad [Good Fortune with Troublesome Effort] called the altar [Ed] : for it [shall be] a witness between us that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered].
Joshua,23,1,"And it came to pass a long time after that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had given rest unto Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] from all their enemies round about, that Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] waxed old [and] stricken in age."
Joshua,23,2,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] called for all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God], [and] for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old [and] stricken in age:"
Joshua,23,3,And you 2f have seen all that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has done unto all these nations because of you; for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is] he that has fought for you.
Joshua,23,4,"Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Yarden [Descender] , with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward."
Joshua,23,5,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and you 2f shall possess their land, as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has promised unto you."
Joshua,23,6,"Be you 2f therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , that you 2f turn not aside from them [to] the right hand or [to] the left;"
Joshua,23,7,"That you 2f come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear [by them] , neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:"
Joshua,23,8,"But cling to (hold onto; stick to) the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , as you 2f have done unto this day."
Joshua,23,9,"For the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has driven out from before you great nations and strong: but [as for] you, no man has been able to stand before you unto this day."
Joshua,23,10,"One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , he [it is] that fights for you, as he has promised you."
Joshua,23,11,"Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that you 2f love the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Joshua,23,12,"Else if you 2f do in any wise go back, and cling to (hold onto; stick to) the remnant of these nations, [even] these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:"
Joshua,23,13,"Know for a certainty that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] will no more drive out [any of] these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until you 2f perish from off this good land which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has given you."
Joshua,23,14,"And, behold, this day I [am] going the way of all the earth: and you 2f know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] spoke concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, [and] not one thing has failed thereof."
Joshua,23,15,"Therefore it shall come to pass, [that] as all good things are come upon you, which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] promised you; so shall the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has given you."
Joshua,23,16,"When you 2f have transgressed the covenant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) be kindled against you, and you 2f shall perish quickly from off the good land which he has given unto you."
Joshua,24,1,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] gathered all the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] to Sh’khem [Shoulder] , and called for the elders of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Joshua,24,2,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] said unto all the people, Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, [even] Terach [station] , the father of Avraham [Exalted Father] , and the father of Nachor [snorting] : and they served other gods."
Joshua,24,3,"And I took your father Avraham [Exalted Father] from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Kena’an [Merchant] , and multiplied his seed, and gave him Yitz’khak [Laughter]."
Joshua,24,4,"And I gave unto Yitz’khak [Laughter] Ya’akov [Heal of God] and ‘Esav [Hairy] : and I gave unto ‘Esav [Hairy] mount Se’ir [Shaggy] , to possess it; but Ya’akov [Heal of God] and his children went down into Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
Joshua,24,5,"I sent Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] also and Aharon [Bright, Very High] , and I plagued Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out."
Joshua,24,6,And I brought your fathers out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : and you 2f came unto the sea; and the Mitzri pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.
Joshua,24,7,"And when they cried unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , he put darkness between you and the Mitzri, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] : and you 2f dwelt in the wilderness a long season."
Joshua,24,8,"And I brought you into the land of the Emori [Highlanders] , which dwelt on the other side Yarden [Descender] ; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that you 2f might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you."
Joshua,24,9,"Then Balak [Devastator] the son of Zippor [Sparrow] , king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , arose and warred against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , and sent and called Bil’am [Not of the People] the son of B’or [Burning] to curse you:"
Joshua,24,10,But I would not hearken unto Bil’am [Not of the People] ; therefore he Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.
Joshua,24,11,"And you 2f went over Yarden [Descender] , and came unto Yericho [Its Moon] : and the men of Yericho [Its Moon] fought against you, the Emori [Highlanders] , and the P’rizi [Dwellers in Unwalled Towns] , and the Kena’ani [Merchant] , and the Hitti [Terrorists] , and the Girgashi [Dwelling on Clay Soil] , the Hivi [Villagers] , and the Y’vusi [Threshers, Trampled Under Foot] ; and I delivered them into your hand."
Joshua,24,12,"And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, [even] the two kings of the Emori [Highlanders]; [but] not with you i sword, nor with you i bow."
Joshua,24,13,"And I have given you a land for which you 2f did not labour, and cities which you 2f built not, and you 2f dwell in them; of the vineyards and olive yards which you 2f planted not do you 2f eat."
Joshua,24,14,"Now therefore fear the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] ; and serve you 2f the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Joshua,24,15,"And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , choose you this day whom you 2f will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that [were] on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Emori [Highlanders] , in whose land you 2f dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Joshua,24,16,"And the people answered and said, God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] forbid that we should forsake the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to serve other gods;"
Joshua,24,17,"For the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , he [it is] that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:"
Joshua,24,18,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) drove out from before us all the people, even the Emori [Highlanders] which dwelt in the land: [therefore] will we also serve the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; for he [is] our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Joshua,24,19,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] said unto the people, You 2f cannot serve the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : for he [is] Elohim K’doshim [A Holy God] ; he [is] El Kano [A Jealous God] ; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins."
Joshua,24,20,"If you 2f forsake the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he has done you good."
Joshua,24,21,"And the people said unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , No; but we will serve the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Joshua,24,22,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] said unto the people, You 2f [are] witnesses against yourselves that you 2f have chosen you the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to serve him. And they said, [We are] witnesses."
Joshua,24,23,"Now therefore put away, [said he] , the strange gods which [are] among you, and incline your heart unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,24,24,"And the people said unto Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] will we serve, and his voice will we obey."
Joshua,24,25,"So Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Sh’khem [Shoulder]."
Joshua,24,26,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] wrote these words in the book of the law of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that [was] by the sanctuary of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Joshua,24,27,"And Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it has heard all the words of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) which he spoke unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest you 2f deny your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Joshua,24,28,"So Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance."
Joshua,24,29,"And it came to pass after these things, that Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] the son of Nun [Posterity] , the servant of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , died, [being] an hundred and ten years old."
Joshua,24,30,"And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnat-Serach [portion of the sun] , which [is] in mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , on the north side of the hill of Ga’ash [Quaking]."
Joshua,24,31,"And Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] served the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) all the days of Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , and all the days of the elders that overlived Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , and which had known all the works of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that he had done for Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Joshua,24,32,"And the bones of Yosef [(God) He Shall Add] , which the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] brought up out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , buried they in Sh’khem [Shoulder] , in a parcel of ground which Ya’akov [Heal of God] bought of the sons of Hamor [male-donkey (ass)] the father of Sh’khem [Shoulder] for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Yosef [(God) He Shall Add]."
Joshua,24,33,"And El’azar [God has helped] the son of Aharon [Bright, Very High] died; and they buried him in a hill [that pertained to] Pinchas [mouth of brass] his son, which was given him in mount Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful]."
