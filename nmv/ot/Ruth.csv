Ruth,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the days when the ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] in Y’hudah went to sojourn in the country of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , he, and his wife, and his two sons."
Ruth,1,2,"And the name of the man [was] Eli-Melekh [my God is king] , and the name of his wife Na’omi [my delight] , and the name of his two sons Machlon [sick] and Kilyon [pining] , Efratim [ashiness: fruitfulness] from Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] in Y’hudah. And they came into the country of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , and settled there."
Ruth,1,3,"And Eli-Melekh [my God is king] Na’omi [my delight] ’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons."
Ruth,1,4,"And they took them wives of the women of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] ; the name of the one [was] ‘Orpah [gazelle] , and the name of the other Rut [friendship] : and they dwelled there about ten years."
Ruth,1,5,And Machlon [sick] and Kilyon [pining] died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.
Ruth,1,6,"Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] : for she had heard in the country of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] how that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had visited his people in giving them bread."
Ruth,1,7,"For what reason she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]."
Ruth,1,8,"And Na’omi [my delight] said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother’s house: the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) deal kindly with you, as you 2f have dealt with the dead, and with me."
Ruth,1,9,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) grant you that you 2f may find rest, each [of you] in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept."
Ruth,1,10,"And they said unto her, Surely we will return with you i unto you i people."
Ruth,1,11,"And Na’omi [my delight] said, Turn again, my daughters: why will you 2f go with me? [are] there yet [any more] sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?"
Ruth,1,12,"Turn again, my daughters, go [your way] ; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, [if] I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;"
Ruth,1,13,"Would you 2f wait for them till they were grown? would you 2f stay for them from having husbands? No, my daughters; for it grieves me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) is gone out against me."
Ruth,1,14,"And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and ‘Orpah [gazelle] kissed her mother in law; but Rut [friendship] clave unto her."
Ruth,1,15,"And she said, Behold, you i sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return you i after you i sister in law."
Ruth,1,16,"And Rut [friendship] said, Intreat me not to leave you i, [or] to return from following after you i : for to which you i go, I will go; and where you i lodge, I will lodge: your i people [shall be] my people, and your i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]:"
Ruth,1,17,"Where you i die, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) do so to me, and more also, [if ought] but death part you i and me."
Ruth,1,18,"When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her."
Ruth,1,19,"So they two went until they came to Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] . And it came to pass, when they were come to Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] , that all the city was moved about them, and they said, [Is] this Na’omi [my delight]?"
Ruth,1,20,"And she said unto them, Call me not Na’omi [my delight] , call me Mara: for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me."
Ruth,1,21,"I went out full, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has brought me home again empty: why [then] call you 2f me Na’omi [my delight] , seeing the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has testified against me, and the Almighty (Shaddai) has afflicted me?"
Ruth,1,22,"So Na’omi [my delight] returned, and Rut [friendship] the Moavi [from father: what father?] , her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] : and they came to Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] in the beginning of barley harvest."
Ruth,2,1,"And Na’omi [my delight] had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Eli-Melekh [my God is king] ; and his name [was] Bo’az [a high rate of movement]."
Ruth,2,2,"And Rut [friendship] the Moaviah [from father: what father?] said unto Na’omi [my delight] , Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after [him] in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter."
Ruth,2,3,"And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and she happened to light on a part of the field [belonging] unto Bo’az [a high rate of movement] , who [was] of the family of Eli-Melekh [my God is king]."
Ruth,2,4,"And, behold, Bo’az [a high rate of movement] came from Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] , and said unto the reapers, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [be] with you. And they answered him, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) bless you i."
Ruth,2,5,"Then said Bo’az [a high rate of movement] unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose girl [is] this?"
Ruth,2,6,"And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It [is] the Moavi [from father: what father?] girl that came back with Na’omi [my delight] out of the country of Mo’av [Seed of my Father]:"
Ruth,2,7,"And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house."
Ruth,2,8,"Then said Bo’az [a high rate of movement] unto Rut [friendship] , Hear you i not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:"
Ruth,2,9," [Let] you i eyes [be] on the field that they do reap, and go you i after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch you i ? and when you i are athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of [that] which the young men have drawn."
Ruth,2,10,"Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in you i eyes, that you i should take knowledge of me, seeing I [am] a stranger?"
Ruth,2,11,"And Bo’az [a high rate of movement] answered and said unto her, It has fully been showed me, all that you i have done unto you i mother in law since the death of you i husband: and [how] you i have left you i father and you i mother, and the land of you i nativity, and are come unto a people which you i knew not heretofore."
Ruth,2,12,"The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) recompense you i work, and a full reward be given you i of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , under whose wings you i are come to trust."
Ruth,2,13,"Then she said, Let me find favour in your i sight, my lord; for that you i have comforted me, and for that you i have spoken friendly unto you i female servant, though I be not like unto one of your i handmaidens."
Ruth,2,14,"And Bo’az [a high rate of movement] said unto her, At mealtime come you i here, and eat of the bread, and dip you i morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched [corn] , and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left."
Ruth,2,15,"And when she was risen up to glean, Bo’az [a high rate of movement] commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach (disgrace; shame) her not:"
Ruth,2,16,"And let fall also [some] of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave [them] , that she may glean [them] , and rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) her not."
Ruth,2,17,"So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an eifah of barley."
Ruth,2,18,"And she took [it] up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed."
Ruth,2,19,"And her mother in law said unto her, Where have you i gleaned to day? and where worked you i ? Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) be he that did take knowledge of you i . And she showed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to day [is] Bo’az [a high rate of movement]."
Ruth,2,20,"And Na’omi [my delight] said unto her daughter in law, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] he of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Na’omi [my delight] said unto her, The man [is] near of family unto us, one of our next kinsmen."
Ruth,2,21,"And Rut [friendship] the Moavi [from father: what father?] said, He said unto me also, you i shall keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest."
Ruth,2,22,"And Na’omi [my delight] said unto Rut [friendship] her daughter in law, [It is] good, my daughter, that you i go out with his maidens, that they meet you i not in any other field."
Ruth,2,23,So she kept fast by the maidens of Bo’az [a high rate of movement] to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.
Ruth,3,1,"Then Na’omi [my delight] her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you i , that it may be well with you i?"
Ruth,3,2,"And now [is] not Bo’az [a high rate of movement] of our family, with whose maidens you i were? Behold, he removes (chaff) from barley to night in the threshing floor."
Ruth,3,3,"Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you i , and put your i clothing upon you i , and get you i down to the floor: [but] make not yourself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking."
Ruth,3,4,"And it shall be, when he lies down, that you i shall mark the place where he shall lie, and you i shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lay you i down; and he will tell you i what you i shall do."
Ruth,3,5,"And she said unto her, All that you i say unto me I will do."
Ruth,3,6,"And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her."
Ruth,3,7,"And when Bo’az [a high rate of movement] had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down."
Ruth,3,8,"And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet."
Ruth,3,9,"And he said, Who [are] you i ? And she answered, I [am] Rut [friendship] you i female servant: spread therefore you i skirt over you i female servant; for you i [are] a near kinsman."
Ruth,3,10,"And he said, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] you i of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , my daughter: [for] you i have showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you i followed not young men, whether poor or rich."
Ruth,3,11,"And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to you i all that you i require: for all the city of my people does know that you i [are] a virtuous woman."
Ruth,3,12,And now it is true that I [am your i ] near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.
Ruth,3,13,"Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, [that] if he will perform unto you i the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman’s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you i , then will I do the part of a kinsman to you i, [as] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives: lie down until the morning."
Ruth,3,14,"And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor."
Ruth,3,15,"Also he said, Bring the veil that [you i have] upon you i , and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six [measures] of barley, and laid [it] on her: and she went into the city."
Ruth,3,16,"And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who [are] you i , my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her."
Ruth,3,17,"And she said, These six [measures] of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto you i mother in law."
Ruth,3,18,"Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until you i know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day."
Ruth,4,1,"Then went Bo’az [a high rate of movement] up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Bo’az [a high rate of movement] spoke came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down."
Ruth,4,2,"And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you 2f down here. And they sat down."
Ruth,4,3,"And he said unto the kinsman, Na’omi [my delight] , that is come again out of the country of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , sells a parcel of land, which [was] our brother Eli-Melekh [my God is king] ’s:"
Ruth,4,4,"And I thought to advertise (to advise, warn, inform, reveal) you i , saying, Buy [it] before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If you i will redeem [it] , redeem [it] : but if you i will not redeem [it, then] tell me, that I may know: for [there is] none to redeem [it] beside you i ; and I [am] after you i . And he said, I will redeem [it]."
Ruth,4,5,"Then said Bo’az [a high rate of movement] , What day you i buy the field of the hand of Na’omi [my delight] , you i must buy [it] also of Rut [friendship] the Moaviah [from father: what father?], the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance."
Ruth,4,6,"And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem [it] for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance: redeem you i my right to yourself; for I cannot redeem [it]."
Ruth,4,7,"Now this [was the manner] in former time in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave [it] to his neighbour: and this [was] a testimony in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ruth,4,8,"Therefore the kinsman said unto Bo’az [a high rate of movement] , Buy [it] for you i . So he drew off his shoe."
Ruth,4,9,"And Bo’az [a high rate of movement] said unto the elders, and [unto] all the people, You 2f [are] witnesses this day, that I have bought all that [was] Eli-Melekh [my God is king] ’s, and all that [was] Kilyon’s [pining] ’s and Machlon’s [sick] ’s, of the hand of Na’omi [my delight]."
Ruth,4,10,"Moreover Rut [friendship] the Mo’avi [of his father] , the wife of Machlon [sick] , have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: you 2f [are] witnesses this day."
Ruth,4,11,"And all the people that [were] in the gate, and the elders, said, [We are] witnesses. The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) make the woman that is come into you i house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : and do you i worthily in Ephrat [ash-heap: place of fruitfulness] , and be famous in Beit-Lechem [House of Bread]:"
Ruth,4,12,"And let you i house be like the house of Partzi [Breach (breaking forth; a break; opening, inlet)] , whom Tamar [palm-tree] bore unto Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , of the seed which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall give you i of this young woman."
Ruth,4,13,"So Bo’az [a high rate of movement] took Rut [friendship] , and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) gave her conception, and she bore a son."
Ruth,4,14,"And the women said unto Na’omi [my delight] , Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , which has not left you i this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Ruth,4,15,"And he shall be unto you i a restorer of [you i ] life, and a nourisher of you i old age: for you i daughter in law, which loves you i , which is better to you i than seven sons, has born him."
Ruth,4,16,"And Na’omi [my delight] took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it."
Ruth,4,17,"And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Na’omi [my delight] ; and they called his name ‘Oved [serving] : he [is] the father of Yishai [I possess] , the father of David [beloved]."
Ruth,4,18,"Now these [are] the generations of Partzi [Breach (breaking forth; a break; opening, inlet)] : Partzi [Breach (breaking forth; a break; opening, inlet)] begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) Hetzron [surrounded by a wall],"
Ruth,4,19,"And Hetzron [surrounded by a wall] begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) Ram [high or exalted] , and Ram [high or exalted] begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) ‘Amminadav [family of the prince],"
Ruth,4,20,"And ‘Amminadav [family of the prince] begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) Nachshon [Enchanter] , and Nachshon [Enchanter] begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) Salmon,"
Ruth,4,21,"And Salmon begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) Bo’az [a high rate of movement] , and Bo’az [a high rate of movement] begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) ‘Oved [serving],"
Ruth,4,22,"And ‘Oved [serving] begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) Yishai [I possess] , and Yishai [I possess] begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) David [beloved]."
