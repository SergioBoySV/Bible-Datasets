Hosea,1,1,"The word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) that came unto Hoshea [salvation] , the son of Be’eri [my well] , in the days of ‘Uziyah [my strength is Yehovah] , Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] , Achaz [he has grasped], [and] Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] , kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and in the days of Yarov’am [the people will contend] the son of Yo’ash [Given by the Lord] , king of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Hosea,1,2,"The beginning of the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) by Hoshea [salvation] . And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said to Hoshea [salvation] , Go, take unto you i a wife of cult prostitution and children of cult prostitution: for the land has committed great whoredom, [departing] from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Hosea,1,3,"So he went and took Gomer [complete] the daughter of Divlayim [two cakes] ; which conceived, and bore him a son."
Hosea,1,4,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto him, Call his name Yizre’el [God Sows] ; for yet a little [while] , and I will avenge the blood of Yizre’el [God Sows] upon the house of Yehu [Yehovah is He] , and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Hosea,1,5,"And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] in the valley of Yizre’el [God Sows]."
Hosea,1,6,"And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And [God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ] said unto him, Call her name Lo-Ruchamah [no mercy] : for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; but I will utterly take them away."
Hosea,1,7,"But I will have mercy upon the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , and will save them by the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen."
Hosea,1,8,"Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruchamah [no mercy] , she conceived, and bore a son."
Hosea,1,9,"Then said [God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ], Call his name Lo-’Ammi [not my people] : for you 2f [are] not my people, and I will not be your [God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ]."
Hosea,1,10,"Yet the number of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where it was said unto them, You 2f [are] not my people, [there] it shall be said unto them, [You 2f are] the sons of the living God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Hosea,1,11,"Then shall the children of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] and the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great [shall be] the day of Yizre’el [God Sows]."
Hosea,2,1,"Say you 2f unto your brethren, ‘Ammi [my people] ; and to your sisters, ‘Ruchamah [pitied]."
Hosea,2,2,"Plead with your mother, plead: for she [is] not my wife, neither [am] I her husband: let her therefore put away her cult prostitution out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;"
Hosea,2,3,"Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst."
Hosea,2,4,And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they [be] the children of cult prostitution.
Hosea,2,5,"For their mother has played the prostitute: she that conceived them has done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give [me] my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink."
Hosea,2,6,"Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your i way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths."
Hosea,2,7,"And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find [them] : then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then [was it] better with me than now."
Hosea,2,8,"For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, [which] they prepared for Ba’al [lord (a false god)]."
Hosea,2,9,"Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax [given] to cover her nakedness."
Hosea,2,10,"And now will I reveal her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand."
Hosea,2,11,"I will also cause all her gladness to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her Shabbat, and all her solemn feasts."
Hosea,2,12,"And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she has said, These [are] my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them."
Hosea,2,13,"And I will visit upon her the days of Ba’alim [lords (false gods)] , wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgot me, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Hosea,2,14,"Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her."
Hosea,2,15,"And I will give her vineyards from there, and the valley of Akhor [Trouble] for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
Hosea,2,16,"And it shall be at that day, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [that] you i shall call me Ishi [My Husband] ; and shall call me no more Ba’ali [lord (a false god)]."
Hosea,2,17,"For I will take away the names of Ba’alim [lords (false gods)] out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name."
Hosea,2,18,"And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and [with] the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely."
Hosea,2,19,"And I will betroth you i unto me forever; yes, I will betroth you i unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies."
Hosea,2,20,I will even betroth you i unto me in faithfulness: and you i shall know the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
Hosea,2,21,"And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;"
Hosea,2,22,"And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Yizre’el [God Sows]."
Hosea,2,23,"And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to [them which were] not my people, you i [are] my people; and they shall say, [you i are] my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Hosea,3,1,"Then said the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of [her] friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) toward the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , who look to other gods, and love raisin cakes."
Hosea,3,2,"So I bought her to me for fifteen [pieces] of silver, and [for] an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:"
Hosea,3,3,"And I said unto her, you i shall abide for me many days; you i shall not play the prostitute, and you i shall not be for [another] man: so [will] I also [be] for you i."
Hosea,3,4,"For the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod (vest) , and [without] teraphim (household gods):"
Hosea,3,5,"Afterward shall the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] return, and seek the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and David [beloved] their king; and shall fear the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) and his goodness in the latter days."
Hosea,4,1,"Hear the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , you 2f people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because [there is] no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in the land."
Hosea,4,2,"By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood touches blood."
Hosea,4,3,"Therefore shall the land mourn, and everyone that dwells in it shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yes, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away."
Hosea,4,4,"Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for your i people [are] as they that strive with the priest."
Hosea,4,5,"Therefore shall you i fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with you i in the night, and I will destroy your i mother."
Hosea,4,6,"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because you i have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you i , that you i shall be no priest to me: seeing you i have forgotten the law of your i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , I will also forget your i children."
Hosea,4,7,"As they were increased, so they sinned against me: [therefore] will I change their glory into shame."
Hosea,4,8,"They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity."
Hosea,4,9,"And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings."
Hosea,4,10,"For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Hosea,4,11,Whoredom and wine and New Wine take away the heart.
Hosea,4,12,"My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declares unto them: for the spirit of cult prostitution has caused [them] to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Hosea,4,13,"They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof [is] good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery."
Hosea,4,14,"I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with prostitutes: therefore the people [that] does not understand shall fall."
Hosea,4,15,"Though you i , Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , play the prostitute, [yet] let not Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] offend (make angry; make one stumble; violate) ; and come not you 2f unto Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] , neither go you 2f up to Beit-On [vanity] [house of vanity] , nor swear, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) lives."
Hosea,4,16,For Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] slides back as a backsliding heifer: now the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) will feed them as a lamb in a large place.
Hosea,4,17,Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] [is] joined to idols: let him alone.
Hosea,4,18,"Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers [with] shame do love, Give you 2f."
Hosea,4,19,"The wind has bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices."
Hosea,5,1,"Hear you 2f this, O priests; and hearken, you 2f house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; and give you 2f ear, O house of the king; for judgment [is] toward you, because you 2f have been a snare on Mitzpah [watchtower] , and a net spread upon Tavor [Mound]."
Hosea,5,2,"And the revolters are profound (go deep into something) to make slaughter, though I [have been] a rebuker of them all."
Hosea,5,3,"I know Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] is not hid from me: for now, O Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , you i commits whoredom, [and] Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] is defiled."
Hosea,5,4,"They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : for the spirit of cult prostitution [is] in the midst of them, and they have not known the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Hosea,5,5,And the pride of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] does testify to his face: therefore shall Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] and Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] fall in their iniquity; Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] also shall fall with them.
Hosea,5,6,They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; but they shall not find [him] ; he has withdrawn himself from them.
Hosea,5,7,They have dealt treacherously against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.
Hosea,5,8,"Blow you 2f the cornet (a wind instrument; horn; trumpet) in Giv’ah [Hill], [and] the trumpet in Ramah [Hill] : cry aloud [at] Beit-On [vanity] [house of vanity] , after you i , O Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength]."
Hosea,5,9,Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] shall be desolate in the day of rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) : among the tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] have I made known that which shall surely be.
Hosea,5,10,The princes of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] were like them that remove the bound: [therefore] I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
Hosea,5,11,"Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] [is] oppressed [and] broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment."
Hosea,5,12,"Therefore [will] I [be] unto Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] as a moth, and to the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] as rottenness."
Hosea,5,13,"When Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] saw his sickness, and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] [saw] his wound, then went Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] to the Ashur (Assyrian) , and sent to king Yarav [contender] : yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound."
Hosea,5,14,"For I [will be] unto Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] : I, [even] I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue [him]."
Hosea,5,15,"I will go [and] return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early."
Hosea,6,1,"Come, and let us return unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : for he has torn, and he will heal us; he has smitten, and he will bind us up."
Hosea,6,2,"After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight."
Hosea,6,3,"Then shall we know, [if] we follow on to know the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter [and] former rain unto the earth."
Hosea,6,4,"O Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , what shall I do unto you i ? O Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , what shall I do unto you i ? for your goodness [is] as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goes away."
Hosea,6,5,Therefore have I hewed [them] by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and your i judgments [are as] the light [that] goes forth.
Hosea,6,6,"For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] more than burnt offerings."
Hosea,6,7,But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
Hosea,6,8,"Gil’ad [Rocky Region] [is] a city of them that work iniquity, [and is] polluted with blood."
Hosea,6,9,"And as troops of robbers wait for a man, [so] the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness."
Hosea,6,10,"I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] : there [is] the whoredom of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] is defiled."
Hosea,6,11,"Also, O Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , he has set an harvest for you i , when I returned the captivity of my people."
Hosea,7,1,"When I would have healed Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , then the iniquity of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] was discovered, and the wickedness of Shomron [watch mountain] : for they commit falsehood; and the thief comes in, [and] the troop of robbers spoils without."
Hosea,7,2,And they consider not in their hearts [that] I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.
Hosea,7,3,"They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies."
Hosea,7,4,"They [are] all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, [who] ceases from raising after he has kneaded the dough, until it be leavened."
Hosea,7,5,In the day of our king the princes have made [him] sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.
Hosea,7,6,"For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleeps all the night; in the morning it burns as a flaming fire."
Hosea,7,7,"They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: [there is] none among them that calls unto me."
Hosea,7,8,"Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , he has mixed himself among the people; Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] is a cake not turned."
Hosea,7,9,"Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knows [it] not: yes, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knows not."
Hosea,7,10,"And the pride of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] testifies to his face: and they do not return to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) their God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , nor seek him for all this."
Hosea,7,11,"Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to (to do entirely, do wholly) Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , they go to Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known)))."
Hosea,7,12,"When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard."
Hosea,7,13,"Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me."
Hosea,7,14,"And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, [and] they rebel against me."
Hosea,7,15,"Though I have bound [and] strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me."
Hosea,7,16,"They return, [but] not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this [shall be] their ridicule (laughing at enemies’ threats) in the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
Hosea,8,1," [Set] the trumpet to your i mouth. [He shall come] as an eagle against the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law."
Hosea,8,2,"Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall cry unto me, My God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , we know you i."
Hosea,8,3,Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] has cast off [the thing that is] good: the enemy shall pursue him.
Hosea,8,4,"They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew [it] not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off."
Hosea,8,5,"You 1s calf, O Shomron [watch mountain] , has cast [you i ] off; my anger is kindled against them: how long [will it be] before they attain to innocency?"
Hosea,8,6,For from Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [was] it also: the workman made it; therefore it [is] not God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] : but the calf of Shomron [watch mountain] shall be broken in pieces.
Hosea,8,7,"For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it has no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow (to approve, commend, accept) it up."
Hosea,8,8,"Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] is swallow (to approve, commend, accept)ed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein [is] no pleasure."
Hosea,8,9,"For they are gone up to Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , a wild ass alone by himself: Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] has hired lovers."
Hosea,8,10,"Yes, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes."
Hosea,8,11,"Because Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] has made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin."
Hosea,8,12,"I have written to him the great things of my law, [but] they were counted as a strange thing."
Hosea,8,13,"They sacrifice flesh [for] the sacrifices of my offerings, and eat [it; but] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) accepts them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place]."
Hosea,8,14,"For Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] has forgotten his Maker, and builds temples; and Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] has multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof."
Hosea,9,1,"Rejoice not, O Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , for joy, as [other] people: for you i have gone a whoring from your i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , you i have loved a reward upon every corn floor."
Hosea,9,2,"The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the New Wine shall fail in her."
Hosea,9,3,"They shall not dwell in the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] land; but Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] shall return to Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and they shall eat unclean [things] in Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known)))."
Hosea,9,4,"They shall not offer wine [offerings] to the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices [shall be] unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Hosea,9,5,"What will you 2f do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)?"
Hosea,9,6,"For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant [places] for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns [shall be] in their tabernacles."
Hosea,9,7,"The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall know [it] : the prophet [is] a fool, the spiritual man [is] mad, for the multitude of you i iniquity, and the great hatred."
Hosea,9,8,"The watchman of Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] [was] with my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]: [but] the prophet [is] a snare of a fowler in all his ways, [and] hatred in the house of his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Hosea,9,9,"They have deeply corrupted [themselves] , as in the days of Giv’ah [Hill]: [therefore] he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins."
Hosea,9,10,"I found Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: [but] they went to Ba’al-P’or [Lord of the Opening] , and separated themselves unto [that] shame; and [their] abominations were according as they loved."
Hosea,9,11," [As for] Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception."
Hosea,9,12,"Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, [that there shall] not [be] a man [left] : yes, woe also to them when I depart from them!"
Hosea,9,13,"Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , as I saw Tzor (Tyrus) [a rock], [is] planted in a pleasant place: but Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] shall bring forth his children to the murderer."
Hosea,9,14,"Give them, O Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) : what will you i give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts."
Hosea,9,15,"All their wickedness [is] in Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] : for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house, I will love them no more: all their princes [are] revolters."
Hosea,9,16,"Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yes, though they bring forth, yet will I slay [even] the beloved [fruit] of their womb."
Hosea,9,17,"My God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations."
Hosea,10,1,"Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] [is] an empty vine, he brings forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he has increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images."
Hosea,10,2,"Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil (plunder; prey; booty) their images."
Hosea,10,3,"For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; what then should a king do to us?"
Hosea,10,4,"They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springs up as hemlock in the furrows of the field."
Hosea,10,5,"The inhabitants of Shomron [watch mountain] shall fear because of the calves of Beit-On [vanity] [house of vanity] : for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof [that] rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it."
Hosea,10,6,"It shall be also carried unto Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) [for] a present to king Yarav [contender] : Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] shall receive shame, and Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] shall be ashamed of his own counsel."
