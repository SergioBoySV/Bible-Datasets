Deuteronomy,1,26,"Yet you 2f would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]:"
Deuteronomy,1,27,"And you 2f murmured in your tents, and said, Because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , to deliver us into the hand of the Emori [Highlanders] , to destroy us."
Deuteronomy,1,28,"Where shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people [is] greater and taller than we; the cities [are] great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the ‘Anakim [Longed-Necked] there."

Deuteronomy,1,41,"Then you 2f answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , we will go up and fight, according to all that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] commanded us. And when you 2f had girded on every man his weapons of war, you 2f were ready to go up into the hill."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I [am] not among you; lest you 2f be smitten before your enemies."
Deuteronomy,1,43,"So I spoke unto you; and you 2f would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and went presumptuously up into the hill."
Deuteronomy,1,44,"And the Emori [Highlanders] , which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Se’ir [Shaggy], [even] unto Hormah [Asylum]."

Deuteronomy,1,46,"So you 2f abode in Kadesh [Holy] many days, according unto the days that you 2f abode [there]."
Deuteronomy,2,1,"Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto me: and we compassed mount Se’ir [Shaggy] many days."
Deuteronomy,2,2,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto me, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,3,You 2f have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
Deuteronomy,2,4,"And command you i the people, saying, You 2f [are] to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of ‘Esav [Hairy] , which dwell in Se’ir [Shaggy] ; and they shall be afraid of you: take you 2f good heed unto yourselves therefore:"
Deuteronomy,2,5,"Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Se’ir [Shaggy] unto ‘Esav [Hairy] [for] a possession."
Deuteronomy,2,6,"You 2f shall buy meat of them for money, that you 2f may eat; and you 2f shall also buy water of them for money, that you 2f may drink."
Deuteronomy,2,7,For the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) you i in all the works of you i hand: he knows you i walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [has been] with you i ; you i have lacked nothing.
Deuteronomy,2,8,"And when we passed by from our brethren the children of ‘Esav [Hairy] , which dwelt in Se’ir [Shaggy] , through the way of the plain from Eilat [Grove of Lofty Trees] , and from ‘Etzyon-Gever [Backbone of a Man] , we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Mo’av [Seed of my Father]."
Deuteronomy,2,9,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto me, Distress not the Mo’avi [of his father] , neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give you i of their land [for] a possession; because I have given ‘Ar [A City] unto the children of Lot [for] a possession."
Deuteronomy,2,10,"The Emim [Terrors] dwelt in it in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the ‘Anakim [Longed-Necked];"

Deuteronomy,2,12,"The Horim [Cave Dweller] also dwelt in Se’ir [Shaggy] formerly; but the children of ‘Esav [Hairy] succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] did unto the land of his possession, which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) gave unto them."
Deuteronomy,2,13,"Now rise up, [said I] , and get you over the brook Zered [Osier Brook] . And we went over the brook Zered [Osier Brook]."
Deuteronomy,2,14,"And the space in which we came from Kadesh [Holy] -Barnea [Holy] , until we were come over the brook Zered [Osier Brook], [was] thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) swore unto them."
Deuteronomy,2,15,"For indeed the hand of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed."
Deuteronomy,2,16,"So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,"
Deuteronomy,2,17,"That the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto me, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,18,"you i are to pass over through ‘Ar [A City] , the coast of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] , this day:"
Deuteronomy,2,19,"And [when] you i come near over against the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] , distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give you i of the land of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] [any] possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot [for] a possession."
Deuteronomy,2,20,(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt in it in old time; and the ‘Amon [Inbred] call them Zamzumim [Plotters];
Deuteronomy,2,21,"A people great, and many, and tall, as the ‘Anakim [Longed-Necked] ; but the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:"
Deuteronomy,2,22,"As he did to the children of ‘Esav [Hairy] , which dwelt in Se’ir [Shaggy] , when he destroyed the Horim [Cave Dweller] from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:"
Deuteronomy,2,23,"And the ‘Avim [Ruins] [Ruins] which dwelt in Hatzerim [Villages], [even] unto ‘Azah [The Strong] , the Kaftorim [A Crown] , which came forth out of Kaftor [A Crown] , destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)"
Deuteronomy,2,24,"Rise you 2f up, take your journey, and pass over the river ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] : behold, I have given into you i hand Sichon [Warrior] the Emori [Rebellious Highlanders] , king of Heshbon [Stronghold] , and his land: begin to possess [it] , and contend with him in battle."
Deuteronomy,2,25,"This day will I begin to put the dread of you i and the fear of you i upon the nations [that are] under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of you i , and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you i."
Deuteronomy,2,26,"And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of K’demot [Eastern] unto Sichon [Warrior] king of Heshbon [Stronghold] with words of peace, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,27,"Let me pass through you i land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left."
Deuteronomy,2,28,"you i shall sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;"
Deuteronomy,2,29,"(As the children of ‘Esav [Hairy] which dwell in Se’ir [Shaggy] , and the Mo’avi [of his father] which dwell in ‘Ar [A City] , did unto me;) until I shall pass over Yarden [Descender] into the land which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] gives us."
Deuteronomy,2,30,"But Sichon [Warrior] king of Heshbon [Stronghold] would not let us pass by him: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into you i hand, as [appears] this day."
Deuteronomy,2,31,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sichon [Warrior] and his land before you i : begin to possess, that you i may inherit his land."
Deuteronomy,2,32,"Then Sichon [Warrior] came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Yachatz [Trampled Down]."
Deuteronomy,2,33,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] delivered him before us; and we struck him, and his sons, and all his people."
Deuteronomy,2,34,"And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:"
Deuteronomy,2,35,"Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) of the cities which we took."
Deuteronomy,2,36,"From ‘Aeo’er [Ruins] , which [is] by the brink of the river of ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] , and [from] the city that [is] by the river, even unto Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , there was not one city too strong for us: the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] delivered all unto us:"
Deuteronomy,2,37,"Only unto the land of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] you i came not, [nor] unto any place of the river Yabok [luxuriant emptying river] , nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] forbad us."
Deuteronomy,3,1,"Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan [Fruitful] : and ‘Og [Long-necked] the king of Bashan [Fruitful] came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edre’i [Good Pasture]."
Deuteronomy,3,2,"And the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into you i hand; and you i shall do unto him as you i did unto Sichon [Warrior] king of the Emori [Highlanders] , which dwelt at Heshbon [Stronghold]."
Deuteronomy,3,3,"So the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] delivered into our hands ‘Og [Long-necked] also, the king of Bashan [Fruitful] , and all his people: and we struck him until none was left to him remaining."
Deuteronomy,3,4,"And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argov [Heap of Clods] , the kingdom of ‘Og [Long-necked] in Bashan [Fruitful]."
Deuteronomy,3,5,"All these cities [were] fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many."
Deuteronomy,3,6,"And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sichon [Warrior] king of Heshbon [Stronghold] , utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city."
Deuteronomy,3,7,"But all the cattle, and the spoil (plunder; prey; booty) of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves."
Deuteronomy,3,8,"And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Emori [Highlanders] the land that [was] on this side Yarden [Descender] , from the river of ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] unto mount Hermon [A Sanctuary];"

Deuteronomy,3,10,"All the cities of the plain, and all Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , and all Bashan [Fruitful] , unto Salkhah [Migration] and Edre’i [Good Pasture] , cities of the kingdom of ‘Og [Long-necked] in Bashan [Fruitful]."
Deuteronomy,3,11,"For only ‘Og [Long-necked] king of Bashan [Fruitful] remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead [was] a bedstead of iron; [is] it not in Rabbah [Great] [Great] of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred] ? nine cubits [was] the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man."
Deuteronomy,3,12,"And this land, [which] we possessed at that time, from ‘Aeo’er [Ruins] , which [is] by the river ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] , and half mount Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Re’uveni [behold, a son!] and to the Gadi [my fortune] [A Troop]."
Deuteronomy,3,13,"And the rest of Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , and all Bashan [Fruitful], [being] the kingdom of ‘Og [Long-necked] , gave I unto the half tribe of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] ; all the region of Argov [Heap of Clods] , with all Bashan [Fruitful] , which was called the land of giants."
Deuteronomy,3,14,"Ya’ir [He Enlightens] the son of M’nasheh [Causing to Forget] took all the country of Argov [Heap of Clods] unto the coasts of G’shuri [Bridge] and Ma’akhati [Oppression] ; and called them after his own name, Bashan-Havot-Ya’ir [Fruitful Villages of the Enlightened Ones] , unto this day."
Deuteronomy,3,15,And I gave Gil’ad [Rocky Region] unto Makhir [Sold].
Deuteronomy,3,16,"And unto the Re’uveni [behold, a son!] and unto the Gadi [my fortune] [A Troop] I gave from Gil’ad [Rocky Region] even unto the river ‘Arnon [Rushing Stream] half the valley, and the border even unto the river Yabok [luxuriant emptying river], [which is] the border of the children of ‘Amon [Inbred];"
Deuteronomy,3,17,"The plain [‘Aravah] also, and Yarden [Descender] , and the coast [thereof] , from Kinneret [Harps] even unto the sea of the plain, [even] the salt sea, under Ashdot-Pisgah [fountain near the mountain cleft (split hoof; an opening, break or split)] eastward."
Deuteronomy,3,18,"And I commanded you at that time, saying, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has given you this land to possess it: you 2f shall pass over armed before your brethren the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , all [that are] meet for the war."
Deuteronomy,3,19,"But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, ( [for] I know that you 2f have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;"
Deuteronomy,3,20,"Until the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and [until] they also possess the land which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has given them beyond Yarden [Descender] : and [then] shall you 2f return every man unto his possession, which I have given you."
Deuteronomy,3,21,"And I commanded Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] at that time, saying, You 1s eyes have seen all that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has done unto these two kings: so shall the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) do unto all the kingdoms to which you i pass."
Deuteronomy,3,22,You 2f shall not fear them: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] he shall fight for you.
Deuteronomy,3,23,"And I besought the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) at that time, saying,"
Deuteronomy,3,24,"O Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , you i have begun to show your i servant your i greatness, and your i mighty hand: for what God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is there] in heaven or in earth, that can do according to you i works, and according to your i might?"
Deuteronomy,3,25,"I pray you i , let me go over, and see the good land that [is] beyond Yarden [Descender] , that goodly mountain, and L’vanon [Whiteness]."
Deuteronomy,3,26,"But the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was exceedingly angry with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto me, Let it suffice you i ; speak no more unto me of this matter."
Deuteronomy,3,27,"Get you i up into the top of Pisgah [Cleft (split hoof; an opening, break or split) Mountain Range] , and lift up you i eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold [it] with you i eyes: for you i shall not go over this Yarden [Descender]."
Deuteronomy,3,28,"But charge Y’hoshua [Yehovah is Salvation] , and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you i shall see."
Deuteronomy,3,29,"So we abode in the valley over against Beit-P’or [House of the Cleft (split hoof; an opening, break or split)]."
Deuteronomy,4,1,"Now therefore hearken, O Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do [them] , that you 2f may live, and go in and possess the land which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of your fathers gives you."
Deuteronomy,4,2,"You 2f shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall you 2f diminish [ought] from it, that you 2f may keep the commandments of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] which I command you."
Deuteronomy,4,3,"Your eyes have seen what the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) did because of Ba’al-P’or [Lord of the Opening] : for all the men that followed Ba’al-P’or [Lord of the Opening] , the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] has destroyed them from among you."
Deuteronomy,4,4,But you 2f that did cling to (hold onto; stick to) the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [are] alive every one of you this day.
Deuteronomy,4,5,"Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] commanded me, that you 2f should do so in the land to which you 2f go to possess it."
Deuteronomy,4,6,"Keep therefore and do [them] ; for this [is] your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation [is] a wise and understanding people."
Deuteronomy,4,7,"For what nation [is there so] great, who [has] God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [so] near unto them, as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] [is] in all [things that] we call upon him [for]?"
Deuteronomy,4,8,"And what nation [is there so] great, that has statutes and judgments [so] righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?"
Deuteronomy,4,9,"Only take heed to yourself, and keep you i soul diligently, lest you i forget the things which you i eyes have seen, and lest they depart from you i heart all the days of you i life: but teach them you i sons, and you i sons’ sons;"
Deuteronomy,4,10," [Specially] the day that you i stood before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] in Horev [Desert] , when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and [that] they may teach their children."

Deuteronomy,9,5,"Not for you i righteousness, or for the uprightness of you i heart, do you i go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] does drive them out from before you i , and that he may perform the word which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) swore unto you i fathers, Avraham [Exalted Father] , Yitz’khak [Laughter] , and Ya’akov [Heal of God]."
Deuteronomy,9,6,"Understand therefore, that the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] gives you i not this good land to possess it for you i righteousness; for you i [are] a stiff-necked people."
Deuteronomy,9,7,"Remember, [and] forget not, how you i provoked the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you i did depart out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , until you 2f came unto this place, you 2f have been rebellious against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."

Deuteronomy,9,13,"Furthermore the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) spoke unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it [is] a stiff-necked people:"
Deuteronomy,9,14,"Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of you i a nation mightier and greater than they."
Deuteronomy,9,15,"So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant [were] in my two hands."
Deuteronomy,9,16,"And I looked, and, behold, you 2f had sinned against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered], [and] had made you a molten calf: you 2f had turned aside quickly out of the way which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had commanded you."

Deuteronomy,9,18,"And I fell down before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which you 2f sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , to provoke him to anger."
Deuteronomy,9,19,"For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, which the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) was exceedingly angry against you to destroy you. But the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) listened unto me at that time also."

Deuteronomy,9,22,"And at Tav’erah [Burning] , and at Massah [Testing] , and at Kivrot-HaTa’avah [Graves of Lust] , you 2f provoked the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) to wrath."
Deuteronomy,9,23,"Likewise when the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) sent you from Kadesh [Holy] -Barnea [Holy] , saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then you 2f rebelled against the commandment of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) your God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and you 2f believed him not, nor listened to his voice."
Deuteronomy,9,24,You 2f have been rebellious against the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) from the day that I knew you.
Deuteronomy,9,25,"Thus I fell down before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) forty days and forty nights, as I fell down [at the first] ; because the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) had said he would destroy you."
Deuteronomy,9,26,"I prayed therefore unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and said, O Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) , destroy not you i people and you i inheritance, which you i have redeemed through you i greatness, which you i have brought forth out of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] with a mighty hand."

Deuteronomy,10,9,"For what reason Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] has no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [is] his inheritance, according as the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] promised him."
Deuteronomy,10,10,"And I detained (held) in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) listened unto me at that time also, [and] the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) would not destroy you i."
