Micah,1,1,"The word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) that came to Mikhah [Who is Like God?] the Moreshet [possession of Gat (wine-vat)] in the days of Toram [Yehovah is Perfect] , Achaz [he has grasped], [and] Hizkiyahu [Yehovah is my strength] , kings of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] , which he saw concerning Shomron [watch mountain] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Micah,1,2,"Hear, all you 2f people; hearken, O earth, and all that in it is: and let the Lord-Adonai [Greatest Above All Things] GOD-Yehōvih (THE FATHER) be witness against you, the Lord-Adonai (The Father) from his holy temple."
Micah,1,3,"For, behold, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) comes forth out of his place, and will come down, and trample upon the high places of the earth."
Micah,1,4,"And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft (split hoof; an opening, break or split) , as grow (become; advance) before the fire, [and] as the waters [that are] poured down a steep place."
Micah,1,5,"For the transgression of Ya’akov [Heal of God] [is] all this, and for the sins of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] . What [is] the transgression of Ya’akov [Heal of God]? [is it] not Shomron [watch mountain] ? and what [are] the high places of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised]? [are they] not Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]?"
Micah,1,6,"Therefore I will make Shomron [watch mountain] as an heap of the field, [and] as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover (uncover; reveal; have first sight of) the foundations thereof."
Micah,1,7,"And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered [it] of the hire of an prostitute, and they shall return to the hire of an prostitute."
Micah,1,8,"Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls."
Micah,1,9,"For her wound [is] incurable; for it is come unto Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised] ; he is come unto the gate of my people, [even] to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Micah,1,10,"Declare you 2f [it] not at Gat [Winepress] , weep you 2f not at all: in the Beit-L’afrah [house of dust] roll yourself in the dust."
Micah,1,11,"Pass you 2f away, you i inhabitant of Safir [faith] , having your i shame naked: the inhabitant of Tza’anan [pointed] came not forth in the mourning of Beit-Ha’etzel [house of narrowing] ; he shall receive of you his standing."
Micah,1,12,For the inhabitant of Marot [bitterness] waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) unto the gate of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace].
Micah,1,13,"O you i inhabitant of Lakhish [Invincible] , bind the chariot to the swift beast: she [is] the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Tziyon [parched place] : for the transgressions of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] were found in you i."
Micah,1,14,Therefore shall you i give presents to Moreshet-Gat [possession of Gat (winepress)] : the houses of Achziv [Deceit] [shall be] a lie to the kings of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God].
Micah,1,15,"Yet will I bring an heir unto you i , O inhabitant of Mareshah [Crest of a Hill] : he shall come unto ‘Adulam [Justice of the People] the glory of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Micah,1,16,"Make you i bald, and mourn you i for your i delicate children; enlarge your i baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from you i."
Micah,2,1,"Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practice it, because it is in the power of their hand."
Micah,2,2,"And they covet fields, and take [them] by violence; and houses, and take [them] away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage."
Micah,2,3,"Therefore thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which you 2f shall not remove your necks; neither shall you 2f go haughtily: for this time [is] evil."
Micah,2,4,"In that day shall [one] take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful (mournful cry; sorrowful howl) lamentation, [and] say, We be utterly spoiled: he has changed the portion of my people: how has he removed [it] from me! turning away he has divided our fields."
Micah,2,5,Therefore you i shall have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate).
Micah,2,6,"Prophesy you 2f not, [say they to them that] prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, [that] they shall not take shame."
Micah,2,7,"O [you i that are] named the house of Ya’akov [Heal of God] , is the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) straitened (impeded or restricted; narrowed, distressed)? [are] these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walks uprightly?"
Micah,2,8,"Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: you 2f pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse (disliking, turned from) from war."
Micah,2,9,The women of my people have you 2f cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have you 2f taken away my glory forever.
Micah,2,10,"Arise you 2f , and depart; for this [is] not [your] rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy [you] , even with a sore destruction."
Micah,2,11,"If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, [saying] , I will prophesy unto you i of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people."
Micah,2,12,"I will surely assemble, O Ya’akov [Heal of God] , all of you i ; I will surely gather the remnant of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; I will put them together as the sheep of Botzrah [sheepfold or fortress] , as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of [the multitude of] men."
Micah,2,13,"The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) on the head of them."
Micah,3,1,"And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Ya’akov [Heal of God] , and you 2f princes of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]; [Is it] not for you to know judgment?"
Micah,3,2,"Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;"
Micah,3,3,"Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay (stip the skin off) their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron."
Micah,3,4,"Then shall they cry unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings."
Micah,3,5,"Thus says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that puts not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him."
Micah,3,6,"Therefore night [shall be] unto you, that you 2f shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that you 2f shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them."
Micah,3,7,"Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yes, they shall all cover their lips; for [there is] no answer of God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]."
Micah,3,8,"But truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Ya’akov [Heal of God] his transgression, and to Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] his sin."
Micah,3,9,"Hear this, I pray you, you 2f heads of the house of Ya’akov [Heal of God] , and princes of the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] , that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity."
Micah,3,10,"They build up Tziyon [parched place] with blood, and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] with iniquity."
Micah,3,11,"The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and say, [Is] not the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) among us? none evil can come upon us."
Micah,3,12,"Therefore shall Tziyon [parched place] for your sake be plowed [as] a field, and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest."
Micah,4,1,"But in the last days it shall come to pass, [that] the mountain of the house of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it."
Micah,4,2,"And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and to the house of the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of Ya’akov [Heal of God] ; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Tziyon [parched place] , and the word of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Micah,4,3,"And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more."
Micah,4,4,But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make [them] afraid: for the mouth of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) Tz’va’ot [of the Heavenly Armies] has spoken [it].
Micah,4,5,"For all people will walk everyone in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] forever and ever."
Micah,4,6,"In that day, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , will I assemble her that is lame, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;"
Micah,4,7,"And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall reign over them in mount Tziyon [parched place] from from this time forth (from now on) , even forever."
Micah,4,8,"And you i , O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Tziyon [parched place] , unto you i shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Micah,4,9,Now why do you i cry out aloud? [is there] no king in you i ? is your i counselor perished? for pangs (extreme sharp pains) have taken you i as a woman in travail.
Micah,4,10,"Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Tziyon [parched place] , like a woman in travail: for now shall you i go forth out of the city, and you i shall dwell in the field, and you i shall go [even] to Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] ; there shall you i be delivered; there the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) shall redeem you i from the hand of you i enemies."
Micah,4,11,"Now also many nations are gathered against you i , that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Tziyon [parched place]."
Micah,4,12,"But they know not the thoughts of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor."
Micah,4,13,"Arise and thresh, O daughter of Tziyon [parched place] : for I will make your i horn iron, and I will make your i hoofs brass: and you i shall beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate (treat as set apart or separate unto God) their gain unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , and their substance unto the Lord-Adon of the whole earth."
Micah,5,1,"Now gather yourself in troops, O daughter of troops: he has laid siege against us: they shall strike the judge of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] with a rod upon the cheek."
Micah,5,2,"But you i , Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] Ephrat [ash-heap: place of fruitfulness], [though] you i be little among the thousands of Y’hudah [Let Him (God) Be Praised], [yet] out of you i shall he come forth unto me [that is] to be ruler in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God] ; whose goings forth [have been] from of old, from everlasting."
Micah,5,3,"Therefore will he give them up, until the time [that] she which travails has brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Micah,5,4,"And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , in the majesty of the name of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) his God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth."
Micah,5,5,"And this [man] shall be the peace, when the Ashur (Assyrian) shall come into our land: and when he shall trample in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men."
Micah,5,6,"And they shall waste the land of Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver [us] from the Ashur (Assyrian) , when he comes into our land, and when he treads within our borders."
Micah,5,7,"And the remnant of Ya’akov [Heal of God] shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , as the showers upon the grass, that tarries not for man, nor waits for the sons of men."
Micah,5,8,"And the remnant of Ya’akov [Heal of God] shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treads down, and tears in pieces, and none can deliver."
Micah,5,9,"You 1s hand shall be lifted up upon your i adversaries, and all your i enemies shall be cut off."
Micah,5,10,"And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , that I will cut off your i horses out of the midst of you i , and I will destroy your i chariots:"
Micah,5,11,"And I will cut off the cities of your i land, and throw down all your i strong holds:"
Micah,5,12,And I will cut off witchcrafts out of your i hand; and you i shall have no [more] soothsayers:
Micah,5,13,"Your 1s graven images also will I cut off, and your i standing images out of the midst of you i ; and you i shall no more worship the work of your i hands."
Micah,5,14,And I will pluck up your i Asherim [false goddess] out of the midst of you i : so will I destroy your i cities.
Micah,5,15,"And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard."
Micah,6,1,"Hear you 2f now what the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) says; Arise, contend you i before the mountains, and let the hills hear you i voice."
Micah,6,2,"Hear you 2f , O mountains, the Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] controversy, and you 2f strong foundations of the earth: for the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) has a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heel Of God]."
Micah,6,3,"O my people, what have I done unto you i ? and wherein have I wearied you i ? testify against me."
Micah,6,4,"For I brought you i up out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] , and redeemed you i out of the house of servants; and I sent before you i Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , Aharon [Bright, Very High] , and Miryam [rebellion]."
Micah,6,5,"O my people, remember now what Balak [Devastator] king of Mo’av [Seed of my Father] consulted, and what Bil’am [Not of the People] the son of B’or [Burning] answered him from Sheetim [The Acacias] unto Gilgal [A Wheel, Rolling] ; that you 2f may know the righteousness of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate)."
Micah,6,6,"Wherewith shall I come before the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate), [and] bow myself before the high God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?"
Micah,6,7,"Will the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) be pleased with thousands of rams, [or] with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn [for] my transgression, the fruit of my body [for] the sin of my soul?"
Micah,6,8,"He has showed you i , O man, what [is] good; and what does the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) require of you i , but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered]?"
Micah,6,9,"The Lord-Yehōvah’s [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] voice cries unto the city, and [the man of] wisdom shall see you i name: hear you 2f the rod, and who has appointed it."
Micah,6,10,"Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure [that is] abominable?"
Micah,6,11,"Shall I count [them] pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?"
Micah,6,12,"For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue [is] deceitful in their mouth."
Micah,6,13,"Therefore also will I make [you i ] sick in attacking you i , in making [you i ] desolate because of your i sins."
Micah,6,14,"you i shall eat, but not be satisfied; and your i casting down [shall be] in the midst of you i ; and you i shall take hold, but shall not deliver; and [that] which you i deliver will I give up to the sword."
Micah,6,15,"you i shall sow, but you i shall not reap; you i shall trample the olives, but you i shall not anoint yourselfi with oil; and sweet wine, but shall not drink wine."
Micah,6,16,"For the statutes of ‘Omri [pupil of Yehovah] are kept, and all the works of the house of Ach’av [father’s brother] , and you 2f walk in their counsels; that I should make you i a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore you 2f shall bear the reproach (disgrace; shame) of my people."
Micah,7,1,"Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: [there is] no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit."
Micah,7,2,The good [man] is perished out of the earth: and [there is] none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.
Micah,7,3,"That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asks, and the judge [asks] for a reward; and the great [man] , he utters his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up."
Micah,7,4,The best of them [is] as a brier: the most upright [is sharper] than a thorn hedge: the day of your i watchmen [and] your i visitation comes; now shall be their perplexity.
Micah,7,5,"Trust you 2f not in a friend, put you 2f not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of you i mouth from her that lies in you i bosom."
Micah,7,6,"For the son dishonours the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man’s enemies [are] the men of his own house."
Micah,7,7,Therefore I will look unto the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) ; I will wait for the God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] of my salvation: my God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] will hear me.
Micah,7,8,"Rejoice not against me, O my enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) [shall be] a light unto me."
Micah,7,9,"I will bear the indignation of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) , because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, [and] I shall behold his righteousness."
Micah,7,10,"Then [she that is] my enemy shall see [it] , and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) you i God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] ? my eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trampled down as the mire of the streets."
Micah,7,11," [In] the day that your i walls are to be built, [in] that day shall the decree be far removed."
Micah,7,12," [In] that day [also] he shall come even to you i from Ashur [the level plain] (the land of the sons of Shem (name, renown (great reputation; being well-known))) , and [from] the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and [from] mountain to mountain."
Micah,7,13,"Yet the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell in it, for the fruit of their doings."
Micah,7,14,"Feed you i people with your i rod, the flock of your i heritage, which dwell solitarily [in] the wood, in the midst of Carmel [Garden-land] : let them feed [in] Bashan [Fruitful] and Gil’ad [Rocky Region] , as in the days of old."
Micah,7,15,According to the days of your i coming out of the land of Mitzrayim [Egypt - The Narrow Place] will I show unto him marvelous [things].
Micah,7,16,"The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay [their] hand upon [their] mouth, their ears shall be deaf."
Micah,7,17,"They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) our God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] , and shall fear because of you i."
Micah,7,18,"Who [is] a God-Elōhīm (The Living Word) [The Many Powered] like unto you i , that pardons iniquity, and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retains not his anger forever, because he delights [in] mercy."
Micah,7,19,"He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and you i will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea."
Micah,7,20,"you i will perform the tto Ya’akov [Heal of God], [and] the mercy to Avraham [Exalted Father] , which you i have sworn unto our fathers from the days of old."
