1 John,1,1,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;"
1 John,1,2,"(For the life was manifested, and we have seen [it] , and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)"
1 John,1,3,"That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that you 2f also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship [is] with the Father, and with his Son Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
1 John,1,4,"And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full."
1 John,1,5,"This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God-The Father is light, and in him is no darkness at all."
1 John,1,6,"If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:"
1 John,1,7,"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] His Son cleanses us from all sin."
1 John,1,8,"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the tis not in us."
1 John,1,9,"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
1 John,1,10,"If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."
1 John,2,1,"My little children, these things write I unto you, that you 2f sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] the righteous:"
1 John,2,2,"And he is the Propitiation (sacrifice to pay for sins against God, to satisfy His righteous anger) for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for [the sins of] the whole world."
1 John,2,3,"And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments."
1 John,2,4,"He that says, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the tis not in him."
1 John,2,5,"But whoso keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God-The Father perfected: hereby know we that we are in him."
1 John,2,6,"He that says he abides in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked."
1 John,2,7,"Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which you 2f had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you 2f have heard from the beginning."
1 John,2,8,"Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines."
1 John,2,9,"He that says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness even until now."
1 John,2,10,"He that loves his brother abides in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him."
1 John,2,11,"But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not to which he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes."
1 John,2,12,"I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake."
1 John,2,13,"I write unto you, fathers, because you 2f have known him [that is] from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you 2f have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because you 2f have known the Father."
1 John,2,14,"I have written unto you, fathers, because you 2f have known him [that is] from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because you 2f are strong, and the word of God-The Father abides in you, and you 2f have overcome the wicked one."
1 John,2,15,"Love not the world, neither the things [that are] in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
1 John,2,16,"For all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world."
1 John,2,17,"And the world passes away, and the lust thereof: but he that does the will of God-The Father abides forever."
1 John,2,18,"Little children, it is the last time: and as you 2f have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time."
1 John,2,19,"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would [no doubt] have continued with us: but [they went out] , that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us."
1 John,2,20,"But you 2f have an unction (an anointing) from the Holy One, and you 2f know all things."
1 John,2,21,"I have not written unto you because you 2f know not the truth, but because you 2f know it, and that no lie is of the truth."
1 John,2,22,"Who is a liar but he that denies that Yeshua [God is Salvation] is the Moshiach [Messiah] ? He is antichrist, that denies the Father and the Son."
1 John,2,23,"Whosoever denies the Son, the same has not the Father:"
1 John,2,24,"Let that therefore abide in you, which you 2f have heard from the beginning. If that which you 2f have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, you 2f also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father."
1 John,2,25,"And this is the promise that he has promised us, [even] eternal life."
1 John,2,26,These [things] have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.
1 John,2,27,"But the anointing which you 2f have received of him abides in you, and you 2f need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you 2f shall abide in him."
1 John,2,28,"And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming."
1 John,2,29,"If you 2f know that he is righteous, you 2f know that every one that does righteousness is born of him."
1 John,3,1,"Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God-The Father: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not."
1 John,3,2,"Beloved, now are we the sons of God-The Father, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is."
1 John,3,3,"And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure."
1 John,3,4,Whosoever commit sin transgresses also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.
1 John,3,5,And you 2f know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.
1 John,3,6,"Whosoever abides in him sins not: whosoever sins has not seen him, neither known him."
1 John,3,7,"Little children, let no man deceive you: he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous."
1 John,3,8,"He that commit sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God-The Father was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil."
1 John,3,9,"Whosoever is born of God-The Father does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God-The Father."
1 John,3,10,"In this the children of God-The Father are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever does not righteousness is not of God-The Father, neither he that loves not his brother."
1 John,3,11,"For this is the message that you 2f heard from the beginning, that we should love one another."
1 John,3,12,"Not as Kayin [something produced, spear], [who] was of that wicked one, and killed his brother. And wherefore killed he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous."
1 John,3,13,"Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you."
1 John,3,14,"We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loves not [his] brother abides in death."
1 John,3,15,Whosoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you 2f know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
1 John,3,16,"Hereby perceive we the love [of God-The Father] , because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down [our] lives for the brethren."
1 John,3,17,"But whoso has this world’s good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels (inward parts; affections) [of compassion] from him, how dwells the love of God-The Father in him?"
1 John,3,18,"My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth."
1 John,3,19,"And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him."
1 John,3,20,"For if our heart condemn us, God-The Father is greater than our heart, and knows all things."
1 John,3,21,"Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, [then] have we confidence toward God-The Father."
1 John,3,22,"And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight."
1 John,3,23,"And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , and love one another, as he gave us commandment."
1 John,3,24,"And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit [Ruach] which he has given us."
1 John,4,1,"Beloved, believe not every Spirit [Ruach] , but try the spirits whether they are of God-The Father: because many false prophets are gone out into the world."
1 John,4,2,Hereby know you 2f the Spirit [Ruach] of God-The Father: Every Spirit [Ruach] that confesses that Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] is come in the flesh is of God-The Father:
1 John,4,3,"And every Spirit [Ruach] that confesses not that Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] is come in the flesh is not of God-The Father: and this is that [Spirit [Ruach] ] of antichrist, whereof you 2f have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world."
1 John,4,4,"You 2f are of God-The Father, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world."
1 John,4,5,"They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world hears them."
1 John,4,6,"We are of God-The Father: he that knows God-The Father hears us; he that is not of God-The Father hears not us. Hereby know we the Spirit [Ruach] of truth, and the Spirit [Ruach] of error."
1 John,4,7,"Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God-The Father; and every one that loves is born of God-The Father, and knows God-The Father."
1 John,4,8,He that loves not knows not God-The Father; for God-The Father is love.
1 John,4,9,"In this was manifested the love of God-The Father toward us, because that God-The Father sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him."
1 John,4,10,"Herein is love, not that we loved God-The Father, but that he loved us, and sent his Son [to be] the Propitiation (sacrifice to pay for sins against God, to satisfy His righteous anger) for our sins."
1 John,4,11,"Beloved, if God-The Father so loved us, we ought also to love one another."
1 John,4,12,"No man has seen God-The Father at any time. If we love one another, God-The Father dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us."
1 John,4,13,"Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit [Ruach]."
1 John,4,14,And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son [to be] the Saviour of the world.
1 John,4,15,"Whosoever shall confess that Yeshua [God is Salvation] is the Son of God-The Father, God-The Father dwells in him, and he in God-The Father."
1 John,4,16,"And we have known and believed the love that God-The Father has to us. God-The Father is love; and he that dwells in love dwells in God-The Father, and God-The Father in him."
1 John,4,17,"Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world."
1 John,4,18,There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear: because fear has torment. He that fears is not made perfect in love.
1 John,4,19,"We love him, because he first loved us."
1 John,4,20,"If a man say, I love God-The Father, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God-The Father whom he has not seen?"
1 John,4,21,"And this commandment have we from him, That he who loves God-The Father love his brother also."
1 John,5,1,Whosoever believes that Yeshua [God is Salvation] is the Moshiach [Messiah] is born of God-The Father: and every one that loves him that begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) loves him also that is begotten of him.
1 John,5,2,"By this we know that we love the children of God-The Father, when we love God-The Father, and keep his commandments."
1 John,5,3,"For this is the love of God-The Father, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous."
1 John,5,4,"For whatsoever is born of God-The Father overcomes the world: and this is the victory that overcomes the world, [even] our faith."
1 John,5,5,"Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Yeshua [God is Salvation] is the Son of God-The Father?"
1 John,5,6,"This is he that came by water and blood, [even] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit [Ruach] that bears witness, because the Spirit [Ruach] is truth."
1 John,5,7,For there are three that bear record in heaven
1 John,5,8,"the Spirit [Ruach] , and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one."
1 John,5,9,"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God-The Father is greater: for this is the witness of God-The Father which he has testified of his Son."
1 John,5,10,He that believes on the Son of God-The Father has the witness in himself: he that believes not God-The Father has made him a liar; because he believes not the record that God-The Father gave of his Son.
1 John,5,11,"And this is the record, that God-The Father has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son."
1 John,5,12,He that has the Son has life; [and] he that has not the Son of God-The Father has not life.
1 John,5,13,"These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God-The Father; that you 2f may know that you 2f have eternal life, and that you 2f may believe on the name of the Son of God-The Father."
1 John,5,14,"And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:"
1 John,5,15,"And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him."
1 John,5,16,"If any man see his brother sin a sin [which is] not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it."
1 John,5,17,All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
1 John,5,18,"We know that whosoever is born of God-The Father sins not; but he that is begotten of God-The Father keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not."
1 John,5,19," [And] we know that we are of God-The Father, and the whole world lies in wickedness."
1 John,5,20,"And we know that the Son of God-The Father is come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, [even] in his Son Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] . This is the true God-The Father, and eternal life."
1 John,5,21,"Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen."
