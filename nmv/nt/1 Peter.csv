1 Peter,1,1,"Kefa [pebble] [pebble] , an apostle of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus [the sea] , Galatia [land of the Galli, Gauls, A Celt] , Cappadocia [province of good horses] , Asia [orient] , and Bithynia,"
1 Peter,1,2,"Elect according to the foreknowledge of God-The Father the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit [Ruach] , unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] : Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied."
1 Peter,1,3,"Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the God-The Father and Father of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] from the dead,"
1 Peter,1,4,"To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,"
1 Peter,1,5,Who are kept by the power of God-The Father through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
1 Peter,1,6,"Wherein you 2f greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you 2f are in heaviness through manifold temptations:"
1 Peter,1,7,"That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]:"
1 Peter,1,8,"Whom having not seen, you 2f love; in whom, though now you 2f see [him] not, yet believing, you 2f rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:"
1 Peter,1,9,"Receiving the end of your faith, [even] the salvation of [your] souls."
1 Peter,1,10,"Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace [that should come] unto you:"
1 Peter,1,11,"Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit [Ruach] of Moshiach [Messiah] which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Moshiach [Messiah] , and the glory that should follow."
1 Peter,1,12,"Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the Gospel (joyful message) unto you with the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into."
1 Peter,1,13,"For what reason gird up the waist of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah];"
1 Peter,1,14,"As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:"
1 Peter,1,15,"But as he which has called you is holy, so be you 2f holy in all manner of Conversation (behavior; way of life; community);"
1 Peter,1,16,"Because it is written, Be you 2f holy; for I am holy."
1 Peter,1,17,"And if you 2f call on the Father, who without respect of persons according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning [here] in fear:"
1 Peter,1,18,"Forasmuch as you 2f know that you 2f were not redeemed with corruptible things, [as] silver and gold, from your vain Conversation (behavior; way of life; community) [received] by tradition from your fathers;"
1 Peter,1,19,"But with the precious blood of Moshiach [Messiah] , as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:"
1 Peter,1,20,"Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,"
1 Peter,1,21,"Who by him do believe in God-The Father, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God-The Father."
1 Peter,1,22,"Seeing you 2f have purified your souls in obeying the tthrough the Spirit [Ruach] unto unfeigned love of the brethren, [see that you 2f ] love one another with a pure heart fervently:"
1 Peter,1,23,"Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God-The Father, which lives and abides forever."
1 Peter,1,24,"For all flesh [is] as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower thereof falls away:"
1 Peter,1,25,But the word of the Lord - Kurios endures forever. And this is the word which by the Gospel (joyful message) is preached unto you.
1 Peter,2,1,"For what reason laying aside all malice, and all deceit, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,"
1 Peter,2,2,"As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you 2f may grow thereby unto salvation:"
1 Peter,2,3,If so be you 2f have tasted that the Lord - Kurios [is] gracious.
1 Peter,2,4,"To whom coming, [as unto] a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God-The Father, [and] precious,"
1 Peter,2,5,"You 2f also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God-The Father by Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
1 Peter,2,6,"For what reason also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Tziyon [a parched place] [Lofty] a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded."
1 Peter,2,7,"Unto you therefore which believe [he is] precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,"
1 Peter,2,8,"And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, [even to them] which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed."
1 Peter,2,9,"But you 2f [are] a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar (particular; special; one’s own) people; that you 2f should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:"
1 Peter,2,10,"Which in time past [were] not a people, but [are] now the people of God-The Father: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy."
1 Peter,2,11,"Dearly beloved, I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) [you] as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;"
1 Peter,2,12,"Having your Conversation (behavior; way of life; community) honest among the Goyim [Gentiles] : that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by [your] good works, which they shall behold, glorify God-The Father in the day of visitation."
1 Peter,2,13,"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord - Kurios’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;"
1 Peter,2,14,"Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well."
1 Peter,2,15,"For so is the will of God-The Father, that with well doing you 2f may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:"
1 Peter,2,16,"As free, and not using [your] liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God-The Father."
1 Peter,2,17,Honour all [men] . Love the brotherhood. Fear God-The Father. Honour the king.
1 Peter,2,18,"Servants, [be] subject to [your] masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the evil, wrong [habitually disposed to disobedience and opposition]."
1 Peter,2,19,"For this [is] thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God-The Father endure grief, suffering wrongfully."
1 Peter,2,20,"For what glory [is it] , if, when you 2f be buffeted for your faults, you 2f shall take it patiently? but if, when you 2f do well, and suffer (allow, to let, permit) [for it] , you 2f take it patiently, this [is] acceptable with God-The Father."
1 Peter,2,21,"For even hereunto were you 2f called: because Moshiach [Messiah] also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you 2f should follow his steps:"
1 Peter,2,22,"Who did no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth:"
1 Peter,2,23,"Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed [himself] to him that righteously:"
1 Peter,2,24,"Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes you 2f were healed."
1 Peter,2,25,For you 2f were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
1 Peter,3,1,"Likewise, you 2f wives, [be] in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conduct of the wives;"
1 Peter,3,2,While they behold your pure (clean; not corrupt) Conversation (behavior; way of life; community) [coupled] with fear.
1 Peter,3,3,"Whose adorning let it not be that outward [adorning] of braiding the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;"
1 Peter,3,4,"But [let it be] the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, [even the ornament] of a meek and quiet Spirit [Ruach] , which is in the sight of God-The Father of great price."
1 Peter,3,5,"For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God-The Father, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:"
1 Peter,3,6,"Even as Sarah [princess] obeyed Avraham [Exalted Father] , calling him lord: whose daughters you 2f are, as long as you 2f do well, and are not afraid with any amazement."
1 Peter,3,7,"Likewise, you 2f husbands, dwell with [them] according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered."
1 Peter,3,8,"Finally, [be you 2f ] all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, [be] pitiful, [be] courteous:"
1 Peter,3,9,"Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that you 2f are thereunto called, that you 2f should inherit a blessing."
1 Peter,3,10,"For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no deceit:"
1 Peter,3,11,"Let him avoid (shun; turn aside from) evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and pursue (to follow after) it."
1 Peter,3,12,"For the eyes of the Lord - Kurios [are] over the righteous, and his ears [are open] unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord - Kurios [is] against them that do evil."
1 Peter,3,13,"And who [is] he that will harm you, if you 2f be followers of that which is good?"
1 Peter,3,14,"But and if you 2f suffer (allow, to let, permit) for righteousness’ sake, happy [are you 2f ] : and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;"
1 Peter,3,15,But sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) the Lord - Kurios God-The Father in your hearts: and [be] ready always to [give] an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:
1 Peter,3,16,"Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good Conversation (behavior; way of life; community) in Moshiach [Messiah]."
1 Peter,3,17,"For [it is] better, if the will of God-The Father be so, that you 2f suffer (allow, to let, permit) for well doing, than for evil doing."
1 Peter,3,18,"For Moshiach [Messiah] also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God-The Father, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit [Ruach]:"
1 Peter,3,19,By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;
1 Peter,3,20,"Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God-The Father waited in the days of No’ach [rest] , while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water."
1 Peter,3,21,"The like figure whereunto [even] baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God-The Father,) by the resurrection of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]:"
1 Peter,3,22,"Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God-The Father; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him."
1 Peter,4,1,"Forasmuch then as Moshiach [Messiah] has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;"
1 Peter,4,2,"That he no longer should live the rest of [his] time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God-The Father."
1 Peter,4,3,"For the time past of [our] life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Goyim [Gentiles] , when we walked in lasciviousness (being lustful, loose or lewd; promoting lustful desires in others) , lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings (drinking, gluttony; rich partying) , and abominable idolatries:"
1 Peter,4,4,"Wherein they think it strange that you 2f run not with [them] to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of [you]:"
1 Peter,4,5,Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.
1 Peter,4,6,"For for this cause was the Gospel (joyful message) preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God-The Father in the Spirit [Ruach]."
1 Peter,4,7,"But the end of all things is at hand: be you 2f therefore sober, and watch unto prayer."
1 Peter,4,8,And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.
1 Peter,4,9,Use hospitality one to another without grudging.
1 Peter,4,10,"As every man has received the gift, [even so] minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God-The Father."
1 Peter,4,11,"If any man speak, [let him speak] as the oracles of God-The Father; if any man minister, [let him do it] as of the ability which God-The Father gives: that God-The Father in all things may be glorified through Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever. Amen."
1 Peter,4,12,"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:"
1 Peter,4,13,"But rejoice, inasmuch as you 2f are partakers of Moshiach [Messiah] ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you 2f may be glad also with exceeding joy."
1 Peter,4,14,"If you 2f be reproached for the name of Moshiach [Messiah] , happy [are you 2f ]; for the Spirit [Ruach] of glory and of God-The Father rests upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified."
1 Peter,4,15,"But let none of you suffer (allow, to let, permit) as a murderer, or [as] a thief, or [as] an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters."
1 Peter,4,16,"Yet if [any man suffer (allow, to let, permit) ] as a Christian [Messianic - Follower of Messiah] , let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God-The Father on this behalf."
1 Peter,4,17,"For the time [is come] that judgment must begin at the house of God-The Father: and if [it] first [begin] at us, what shall the end [be] of them that obey not the Gospel (joyful message) of God-The Father?"
1 Peter,4,18,"And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?"
1 Peter,4,19,"For what reason let them that suffer (allow, to let, permit) according to the will of God-The Father commit the keeping of their souls [to him] in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator."
1 Peter,5,1,"The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Moshiach [Messiah] , and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:"
1 Peter,5,2,"Feed the flock of God-The Father which is among you, taking the oversight [thereof] , not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy profit, but of a ready mind;"
1 Peter,5,3,"Neither as being lords over [God-The Father’s] heritage, but being examples (types) to the flock."
1 Peter,5,4,"And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you 2f shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away."
1 Peter,5,5,"Likewise, you 2f younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yes, all [of you] be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God-The Father resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble."
1 Peter,5,6,"Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God-The Father, that he may exalt you in due time:"
1 Peter,5,7,Casting all your care upon him; for he cares for you.
1 Peter,5,8,"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:"
1 Peter,5,9,"Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world."
1 Peter,5,10,"But the God-The Father of all grace, who has called us unto his eternal glory by Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , after that you 2f have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle [you]."
1 Peter,5,11,To him [be] glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
1 Peter,5,12,"By Silvanus (Silas) [woody] , a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God-The Father wherein you 2f stand."
1 Peter,5,13,"The [church that is] at Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) (Babylon) [confusion] , elected together with [you] , salutes you; and [so does] Marcus [a defense] my son."
1 Peter,5,14,Greet you 2f one another with a kiss of charity. Peace [be] with you all that are in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] . Amen.
