Titus,1,1,"Sha’ul [desired] , a slave of God-The Father, and an apostle of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , according to the faith of God-The Father’s elect, and the acknowledging of the twhich is after godliness;"
Titus,1,2,"In hope of eternal life, which God-The Father, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;"
Titus,1,3,"But has in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God-The Father our Saviour;"
Titus,1,4,"To Titus [nurse], [my] own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God-The Father the Father and the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] our Saviour."
Titus,1,5,"For this cause left I you i in Crete [fleshy] , that you i should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you i:"
Titus,1,6,"If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly."
Titus,1,7,"For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God-The Father; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy profit;"
Titus,1,8,"But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;"
Titus,1,9,"Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convict the gainsayers."
Titus,1,10,"For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:"
Titus,1,11,"Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy profit’s sake."
Titus,1,12,"One of themselves, [even] a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians [fleshy] [are] always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons."
Titus,1,13,"This witness is true. For what reason rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;"
Titus,1,14,"Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth."
Titus,1,15,Unto the pure all things [are] pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving [is] nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
Titus,1,16,"They profess that they know God-The Father; but in works they deny [him] , being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate (rejected; failing the test; lost in sin)."
Titus,2,1,But speak you i the things which become sound doctrine:
Titus,2,2,"That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience."
Titus,2,3,"The aged women likewise, that [they be] in behaviour as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;"
Titus,2,4,"That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,"
Titus,2,5," [To be] discreet, pure (clean; not corrupt) , keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God-The Father be not blasphemed."
Titus,2,6,Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
Titus,2,7,"In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine [showing] uncorruptness, gravity, with incorruption,"
Titus,2,8,"Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you."
Titus,2,9," [Exhort] servants to be obedient unto their own masters, [and] to please [them] well in all [things] ; not answering again;"
Titus,2,10,"Not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God-The Father our Saviour in all things."
Titus,2,11,"For the grace of God-The Father that brings salvation has appeared to all men,"
Titus,2,12,"Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;"
Titus,2,13,"Looking for that Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God-The Father and our Saviour Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah];"
Titus,2,14,"Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar (particular; special; one’s own) people, zealous of good works."
Titus,2,15,"These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) with all authority. Let no man despise you i."
Titus,3,1,"Put [a bow] them in mind to be subject to Principalities (rulers or their territory) and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,"
Titus,3,2,"To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, [but] gentle, showing all meekness unto all men."
Titus,3,3,"For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving different lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, [and] hating one another."
Titus,3,4,"But after that the kindness and love of God-The Father our Saviour toward man appeared,"
Titus,3,5,"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh];"
Titus,3,6,Which he shed on us abundantly through Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] our Saviour;
Titus,3,7,"That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life."
Titus,3,8," [This is] a faithful saying, and these things I will that you i affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God-The Father might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men."
Titus,3,9,"But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain."
Titus,3,10,A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;
Titus,3,11,"Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sins, being condemned of himself."
Titus,3,12,"When I shall send Artemas [a gift of prompt, safe] unto you i , or Tychicus [fateful] , be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis [city of victory] : for I have determined there to winter."
Titus,3,13,"Bring Zenas [the gift of Zeus] the lawyer and Apollos [given by Apollo (etymology uncertain)] on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them."
Titus,3,14,"And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful."
Titus,3,15,"All that are with me salute you i . Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace [be] with you all. Amen. <[It was written to Titus [nurse] , ordained the first bishop of the church of the Cretians [fleshy] , from Nicopolis [city of victory] of Macedonia [extended land] .]>"
