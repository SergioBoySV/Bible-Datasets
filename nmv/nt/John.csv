John,1,1,"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God-Theos, and the Word was God-Theos."
John,1,2,The same was in the beginning with God-Theos.
John,1,3,All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
John,1,4,In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
John,1,5,And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
John,1,6,"There was a man sent from God-Theos, whose name [was] Yochanan [Yehovah has graced]."
John,1,7,"The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all [men] through him might believe."
John,1,8,"He was not that Light, but [was sent] to bear witness of that Light."
John,1,9," [That] was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world."
John,1,10,"He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not."
John,1,11,"He came unto his own, and his own received him not."
John,1,12,"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God-Theos, [even] to them that believe on his name:"
John,1,13,"Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God-Theos."
John,1,14,"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."
John,1,15,"Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me."
John,1,16,"And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace."
John,1,17,"For the law was given through Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters], [but] grace and tcame by Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
John,1,18,"No man has seen God-Theos at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared [him]."
John,1,19,"And this is the record of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , when the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] sent priests and Levi’im (Levites) [Joined to] from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to ask him, Who are you i?"
John,1,20,"And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Moshiach [Messiah]."
John,1,21,"And they asked him, What then? Are you i Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] ? And he says, I am not. Are you i that prophet? And he answered, No."
John,1,22,"Then said they unto him, Who are you i ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What say you i of yourself?"
John,1,23,"He said, I [am] the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord - Kurios, as said the prophet Yesha’yahu [Yah is salvation]."
John,1,24,And they which were sent were of the P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists].
John,1,25,"And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptize you i then, if you i be not that Moshiach [Messiah] , nor Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] , neither that prophet?"
John,1,26,"Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands one among you, whom you 2f know not;"
John,1,27,"He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s sandal lace I am not worthy to unloose."
John,1,28,"These things were done in Bet-Abara [house of the ford] beyond Yarden [descender] , where Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] was baptizing."
John,1,29,"The next day Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] sees Yeshua [God is Salvation] coming unto him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God-Theos, which takes away the sin of the world."
John,1,30,"This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me."
John,1,31,"And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] , therefore am I come baptizing in water."
John,1,32,"And Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit [Ruach] descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him."
John,1,33,"And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, the same said unto me, Upon whom you i shall see the Spirit [Ruach] descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh]."
John,1,34,"And I saw, and bore record that this is the Son of God-Theos."
John,1,35,"Again the next day after Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] stood, and two of his disciples;"
John,1,36,"And looking upon Yeshua [God is Salvation] as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God-Theos!"
John,1,37,"And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
John,1,38,"Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] turned, and saw them following, and says unto them, What seek you 2f ? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwell you i?"
John,1,39,"He says unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour."
John,1,40,"One of the two which heard Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] [speak] , and followed him, was Andrew [of a man] , Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] ’s brother."
John,1,41,"He first finds his own brother Shim’on [he has heard] , and says unto him, We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Moshiach [Messiah]."
John,1,42,"And he brought him to Yeshua [God is Salvation] . And when Yeshua [God is Salvation] beheld him, he said, you i are Shim’on [he has heard] the son of Yona [peaceable] : you i shall be called Kefa, which is by interpretation, A pebble."
John,1,43,"The day following Yeshua [God is Salvation] would go forth into Galil [circuit, district] , and finds Philip [friend of horses] , and says unto him, Follow me."
John,1,44,"Now Philip [friend of horses] was of Beit-Tzaidah [house of fish] , the city of Andrew [of a man] and Kefa [pebble]."
John,1,45,"Philip [friend of horses] finds Nathanael, and says unto him, We have found him, of whom Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] in the law, and the prophets, did write, Yeshua [God is Salvation] of Natzeret [one separated] , the son of Yosef [God will add]."
John,1,46,"And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Natzeret [one separated] ? Philip [friend of horses] says unto him, Come and see."
John,1,47,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, Behold an Israeli indeed, in whom is no deceit!"
John,1,48,"Nathanael says unto him, Whence know you i me? Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto him, Before that Philip [friend of horses] called you i , when you i were under the fig tree, I saw you i."
John,1,49,"Nathanael answered and says unto him, Rabbi, you i are the Son of God-The Father; you i are the King of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God]."
John,1,50,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto him, Because I said unto you i , I saw you i under the fig tree, believe you i ? you i shall see greater things than these."
John,1,51,"And he says unto him, Truly, truly, I say unto you, Hereafter you 2f shall see heaven open, and the angels of God-The Father ascending and descending upon the Son of Man."
John,2,1,"And the third day there was a marriage in Kanah [place of reeds] of Galil [circuit, district] ; and the mother of Yeshua [God is Salvation] was there:"
John,2,2,"And both Yeshua [God is Salvation] was called, and his disciples, to the marriage."
John,2,3,"And when they wanted wine, the mother of Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto him, They have no wine."
John,2,4,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto her, Woman, what have I to do with you i ? my hour is not yet come."
John,2,5,"His mother says unto the servants, Whatsoever he says unto you, do [it]."
John,2,6,"And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , containing two or three firkins apiece."
John,2,7,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim."
John,2,8,"And he says unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bore [it]."
John,2,9,"When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not from what place it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,"
John,2,10,"And says unto him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: [but] you i have kept the good wine until now."
John,2,11,"This beginning of miracles did Yeshua [God is Salvation] in Kanah [place of reeds] of Galil [circuit, district] , and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him."
John,2,12,"After this he went down to K’far-Nachum [town of comfort] , he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days."
John,2,13,"And the Y’hudit (Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah]’) Passover was at hand, and Yeshua [God is Salvation] went up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace],"
John,2,14,"And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:"
John,2,15,"And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;"
John,2,16,"And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise."
John,2,17,"And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of your i house has eaten me up."
John,2,18,"Then answered the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] and said unto him, What sign shows you i unto us, seeing that you i do these things?"
John,2,19,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
John,2,20,"Then said the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you i rear it up in three days?"
John,2,21,But he spoke of the temple of his body.
John,2,22,"When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Yeshua [God is Salvation] had said."
John,2,23,"Now when he was in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] at the Passover, in the feast [day] , many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did."
John,2,24,"But Yeshua [God is Salvation] did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all [men],"
John,2,25,And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
John,3,1,"There was a man of the P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist]s) [separatists] , named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah]:"
John,3,2,"The same came to Yeshua [God is Salvation] by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that you i are a teacher come from God-The Father: for no man can do these miracles that you i do, except God-The Father be with him."
John,3,3,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto him, Truly, truly, I say unto you i , Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God-The Father."
John,3,4,"Nicodemus says unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?"
John,3,5,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered, Truly, truly, I say unto you i , Except a man be born of water and [of] the Spirit [Ruach] , he cannot enter into the kingdom of God-The Father."
John,3,6,That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit [Ruach] is Spirit [Ruach].
John,3,7,"Marvel not that I said unto you i , You 2f must be born again."
John,3,8,"The wind blows where it lists, and you i hear the sound thereof, but can not tell from what place it comes, and to which it goes: so is every one that is born of the Spirit [Ruach]."
John,3,9,"Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?"
John,3,10,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto him, Are you i a master of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] , and know not these things?"
John,3,11,"Truly, truly, I say unto you i , We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and you 2f receive not our witness."
John,3,12,"If I have told you earthly things, and you 2f believe not, how shall you 2f believe, if I tell you [of] heavenly things?"
John,3,13,"And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, [even] the Son of Man which is in heaven."
John,3,14,"And as Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up:"
John,3,15,"That whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life."
John,3,16,"For God-The Father so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
John,3,17,For God-The Father sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
John,3,18,"He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God-The Father."
John,3,19,"And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil."
John,3,20,"For every one that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved."
John,3,21,"But he that does tcomes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God-The Father."
John,3,22,"After these things came Yeshua [God is Salvation] and his disciples into the land of Y’hudah [praised] ; and there he tarried with them, and baptized."
John,3,23,"And Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] also was baptizing in Einayim [springs] near to Shalem [peace] , because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized."
John,3,24,For Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] was not yet cast into prison.
John,3,25,Then there arose a question between [some] of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] ’s disciples and the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] about purifying.
John,3,26,"And they came unto Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with you i beyond Yarden [descender] , to whom you i barest witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all [men] come to him."
John,3,27,"Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven."
John,3,28,"You 2f yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Moshiach [Messiah] , but that I am sent before him."
John,3,29,"He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled."
John,3,30,"He must increase, but I [must] decrease."
John,3,31,"He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all."
John,3,32,"And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no man receives his testimony."
John,3,33,He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God-The Father is true.
John,3,34,For he whom God-The Father has sent speaks the words of God-The Father: for God-The Father gives not the Spirit [Ruach] by measure [unto him].
John,3,35,"The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand."
John,3,36,He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God-The Father abides on him.
John,4,1,"When therefore the Lord - Kurios knew how the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] had heard that Yeshua [God is Salvation] made and baptized more disciples than Yochanan [Yehovah has graced],"
John,4,2,"(Though Yeshua [God is Salvation] himself baptized not, but his disciples,)"
John,4,3,"He left Y’hudah [praised] , and departed again into Galil [circuit, district]."
John,4,4,And he must needs go through Shomron [watch mountain].
John,4,5,"Then comes he to a city of Shomron [watch mountain] , which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] [Heal of God] gave to his son Yosef [God will add]."
John,4,6,"Now Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] [Heal of God] ’s well was there. Yeshua [God is Salvation] therefore, being wearied with [his] journey, sat thus on the well: [and] it was about the sixth hour."
John,4,7,"There comes a woman of Shomron [watch mountain] to draw water: Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto her, Give me to drink."
John,4,8,(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
John,4,9,"Then says the woman of Shomron [watch mountain] unto him, How is it that you i , being a Jewish person, ask drink of me, which am a woman of Shomron [watch mountain] ? for the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] have no dealings with the Shomronim [of Samaria (the watch-mountain)]."
John,4,10,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto her, If you i knew the gift of God-The Father, and who it is that says to you i , Give me to drink; you i would have asked of him, and he would have given you i living water."
John,4,11,"The woman says unto him, Sir, you i have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from what place then have you i that living water?"
John,4,12,"Are you i greater than our father Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] [Heal of God] , which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?"
John,4,13,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto her, Whosoever drink of this water shall thirst again:"
John,4,14,But whosoever drink of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
John,4,15,"The woman says unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come here to draw."
John,4,16,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto her, Go, call your i husband, and come here."
John,4,17,"The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto her, you i have well said, I have no husband:"
John,4,18,For you i have had five husbands; and he whom you i now have is not your i husband: in that said you i truly.
John,4,19,"The woman says unto him, Sir, I perceive that you i are a prophet."
John,4,20,"Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and you 2f say, that in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] is the place where men ought to worship."
John,4,21,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you 2f shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , worship the Father."
John,4,22,You 2f worship you 2f know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah].
John,4,23,"But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in Spirit [Ruach] and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him."
John,4,24,God-The Father [is] a Spirit [Ruach] : and they that worship him must worship [him] in Spirit [Ruach] and in truth.
John,4,25,"The woman says unto him, I know that Messiah comes, which is called Moshiach [Messiah] : when he is come, he will tell us all things."
John,4,26,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto her, I that speak unto you i am [he]."
John,4,27,"And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seek you i ? or, Why talk you i with her?"
John,4,28,"The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and says to the men,"
John,4,29,"Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Moshiach [Messiah]?"
John,4,30,"Then they went out of the city, and came unto him."
John,4,31,"In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat."
John,4,32,"But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that you 2f know not of."
John,4,33,"Therefore said the disciples one to another, Has any man brought him [ought] to eat?"
John,4,34,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work."
John,4,35,"Say not you 2f , There are yet four months, and [then] comes harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest."
John,4,36,"And he that reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit unto life eternal: that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together."
John,4,37,"And herein is that saying true, One sows, and another reaps."
John,4,38,"I sent you to reap that whereon you 2f bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and you 2f are entered into their labours."
John,4,39,"And many of the Shomronim [of Samaria (the watch-mountain)] of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did."
John,4,40,"So when the Shomronim [of Samaria (the watch-mountain)] were come unto him, they besought him that he would wait with them: and he abode there two days."
John,4,41,And many more believed because of his own word;
John,4,42,"And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of you i saying: for we have heard [him] ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Moshiach [Messiah] , the Saviour of the world."
John,4,43,"Now after two days he departed there, and went into Galil [circuit, district]."
John,4,44,"For Yeshua [God is Salvation] himself testified, that a prophet has no honour in his own country."
John,4,45,"Then when he was come into Galil [circuit, district] , the Galilaeans [wheels] received him, having seen all the things that he did at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] at the feast: for they also went unto the feast."
John,4,46,"So Yeshua [God is Salvation] came again into Kanah [place of reeds] of Galil [circuit, district] , where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at K’far-Nachum [town of comfort]."
John,4,47,"When he heard that Yeshua [God is Salvation] was come out of Y’hudah [praised] into Galil [circuit, district] , he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death."
John,4,48,"Then said Yeshua [God is Salvation] unto him, Except you 2f see signs and wonders, you 2f will not believe."
John,4,49,"The nobleman says unto him, Sir, come down before my child die."
John,4,50,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto him, Go you i way; your i son lives. And the man believed the word that Yeshua [God is Salvation] had spoken unto him, and he went his way."
John,4,51,"And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told [him] , saying, You 1s son lives."
John,4,52,"Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."
John,4,53,"So the father knew that [it was] at the same hour, in the which Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto him, You 1s son lives: and himself believed, and his whole house."
John,4,54,"This [is] again the second miracle [that] Yeshua [God is Salvation] did, when he was come out of Y’hudah [praised] into Galil [circuit, district]."
John,5,1,After this there was a feast of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] ; and Yeshua [God is Salvation] went up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace].
John,5,2,"Now there is at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] by the sheep [market] a pool, which is called in the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] tongue Beit-Zata [house of mercy] , having five porches."
John,5,3,"In these lay a great multitude of impotent (weak; without strength or power) folk, of blind, lame (crippled in the feet) , withered, waiting for the moving of the water."
John,5,4,"For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had."
John,5,5,"And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years."
John,5,6,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time [in that case] , he says unto him, Will you i be made whole?"
John,5,7,"The impotent (weak; without strength or power) man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steps down before me."
John,5,8,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto him, Rise, take up your i bed, and walk."
John,5,9,"And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the Shabbat [rest]."
John,5,10,"The Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the Shabbat [rest] day: it is not lawful for you i to carry [your i ] bed."
John,5,11,"He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up your i bed, and walk."
John,5,12,"Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto you i , Take up your i bed, and walk?"
John,5,13,"And he that was healed did not know not who it was: for Yeshua [God is Salvation] had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in [that] place."
John,5,14,"Afterward Yeshua [God is Salvation] finds him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, you i are made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto you i."
John,5,15,"The man departed, and told the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] that it was Yeshua [God is Salvation] , which had made him whole."
John,5,16,"And therefore did the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] persecute Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the Shabbat [rest] day."
John,5,17,"But Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them, My Father works up to this time, and I work."
John,5,18,"Therefore the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the Shabbat [rest] , but said also that God-The Father was his Father, making himself equal with God-The Father."
John,5,19,"Then answered Yeshua [God is Salvation] and said unto them, Truly, truly, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise."
John,5,20,"For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and he will show him greater works than these, that you 2f may marvel."
John,5,21,"For as the Father raises up the dead, and quickens [them] ; even so the Son quickens whom he will."
John,5,22,"For the Father no man, but has committed all judgment unto the Son:"
John,5,23,"That all [men] should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honours not the Son honours not the Father which has sent him."
John,5,24,"Truly, truly, I say unto you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life."
John,5,25,"Truly, truly, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God-The Father: and they that hear shall live."
John,5,26,For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;
John,5,27,"And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of Man."
John,5,28,"Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,"
John,5,29,"And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."
John,5,30,"I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which has sent me."
John,5,31,"If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true."
John,5,32,There is another that bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.
John,5,33,"You 2f sent unto Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , and he bore witness unto the truth."
John,5,34,"But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that you 2f might be saved."
John,5,35,He was a burning and a shining light: and you 2f were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
John,5,36,"But I have greater witness than [that] of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] : for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me."
John,5,37,"And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You 2f have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape."
John,5,38,"And you 2f have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you 2f believe not."
John,5,39,Search the scriptures; for in them you 2f think you 2f have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.
John,5,40,"And you 2f will not come to me, that you 2f might have life."
John,5,41,I receive not honour from men.
John,5,42,"But I know you, that you 2f have not the love of God-The Father in you."
John,5,43,"I am come in my Father’s name, and you 2f receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you 2f will receive."
John,5,44,"How can you 2f believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that [comes] from God-The Father only?"
John,5,45,"Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is [one] that accuseth you, [even] Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , in whom you 2f trust."
John,5,46,"For had you 2f believed Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , you 2f would have believed me: for he wrote of me."
John,5,47,"But if you 2f believe not his writings, how shall you 2f believe my words?"
John,6,1,"After these things Yeshua [God is Salvation] went over the sea of Galil [circuit, district] , which is [the sea] of Tiberias [from the river-god]."
John,6,2,"And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased."
John,6,3,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples."
John,6,4,"And the Passover, a feast of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , was near."
John,6,5,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] then lifted up [his] eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he says unto Philip [friend of horses] , Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?"
John,6,6,And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.
John,6,7,"Philip [friend of horses] answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little."
John,6,8,"One of his disciples, Andrew [of a man] , Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] ’s brother, says unto him,"
John,6,9,"There is a boy here, which has five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?"
John,6,10,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand."
John,6,11,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would."
John,6,12,"When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost."
John,6,13,"Therefore they gathered [them] together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten."
John,6,14,"Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Yeshua [God is Salvation] did, said, This is of a tthat prophet that should come into the world."
John,6,15,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone."
John,6,16,"And when even was [now] come, his disciples went down unto the sea,"
John,6,17,"And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward K’far-Nachum [town of comfort] . And it was now dark, and Yeshua [God is Salvation] was not come to them."
John,6,18,And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
John,6,19,"So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Yeshua [God is Salvation] walking on the sea, and drawing near unto the ship: and they were afraid."
John,6,20,"But he says unto them, It is I; be not afraid."
John,6,21,Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land to which they went.
John,6,22,"The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Yeshua [God is Salvation] went not with his disciples into the boat, but [that] his disciples were gone away alone;"
John,6,23,"(However there came other boats from Tiberias [from the river-god] near unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord - Kurios had given thanks)"
John,6,24,"When the people therefore saw that Yeshua [God is Salvation] was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to K’far-Nachum [town of comfort] , seeking for Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
John,6,25,"And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when came you i here?"
John,6,26,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say unto you, You 2f seek me, not because you 2f saw the miracles, but because you 2f did eat of the loaves, and were filled."
John,6,27,"Labour not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man shall give unto you: for him has God-The Father the Father sealed."
John,6,28,"Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God-The Father?"
John,6,29,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto them, This is the work of God-The Father, that you 2f believe on him whom he has sent."
John,6,30,"They said therefore unto him, What sign shows you i then, that we may see, and believe you i ? what do you i work?"
John,6,31,"Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat."
John,6,32,"Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto them, Truly, truly, I say unto you, Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven."
John,6,33,"For the bread of God-The Father is he which comes down from heaven, and gives life unto the world."
John,6,34,"Then said they unto him, Lord - Kurios, evermore give us this bread."
John,6,35,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger; and he that believes on me shall never thirst."
John,6,36,"But I said unto you, That you 2f also have seen me, and believe not."
John,6,37,All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will assuredly not (by no means) cast out.
John,6,38,"For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me."
John,6,39,"And this is the Father’s will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day."
John,6,40,"And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day."
John,6,41,"The Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven."
John,6,42,"And they said, Is not this Yeshua [God is Salvation] , the son of Yosef [God will add] , whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he says, I came down from heaven?"
John,6,43,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves."
John,6,44,"No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day."
John,6,45,"It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God-The Father. Every man therefore that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes unto me."
John,6,46,"Not that any man has seen the Father, save he which is of God-The Father, he has seen the Father."
John,6,47,"Truly, truly, I say unto you, He that believes on me has everlasting life."
John,6,48,I am that bread of life.
John,6,49,"Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead."
John,6,50,"This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die."
John,6,51,"I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."
John,6,52,"The Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us [his] flesh to eat?"
John,6,53,"Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto them, Truly, truly, I say unto you, Except you 2f eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you 2f have no life in you."
John,6,54,"Whoso eats my flesh, and drink my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."
John,6,55,"For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed."
John,6,56,"He that eats my flesh, and drink my blood, dwells in me, and I in him."
John,6,57,"As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eats me, even he shall live by me."
John,6,58,"This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eats of this bread shall live forever."
John,6,59,"These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in K’far-Nachum [town of comfort]."
John,6,60,"Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard [this] , said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?"
John,6,61,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Does this offend (make angry; make one stumble; violate) you?"
John,6,62, [What] and if you 2f shall see the Son of Man ascend up where he was before?
John,6,63,"It is the Spirit [Ruach] that quickens; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak unto you, [they] are Spirit [Ruach] , and [they] are life."
John,6,64,"But there are some of you that believe not. For Yeshua [God is Salvation] knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him."
John,6,65,"And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father."
John,6,66,"From that [time] many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him."
John,6,67,"Then said Yeshua [God is Salvation] unto the twelve, Will you 2f also go away?"
John,6,68,"Then Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] answered him, Lord - Kurios, to whom shall we go? you i have the words of eternal life."
John,6,69,"And we believe and are sure that you i are that Moshiach [Messiah] , the Son of the living God-The Father."
John,6,70,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
John,6,71,"He spoke of Y’hudah [praised] From K’riot [cities] [the son] of Shim’on [he has heard] : for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve."
John,7,1,"After these things Yeshua [God is Salvation] walked in Galil [circuit, district] : for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] sought to kill him."
John,7,2,Now the Y’hudit (Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] ’) feast of tabernacles was at hand.
John,7,3,"His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Y’hudah [praised] , that your i disciples also may see the works that you i do."
John,7,4,"For [there is] no man [that] does any thing in secret, and he himself seeks to be known openly. If you i do these things, show yourself to the world."
John,7,5,For neither did his brethren believe in him.
John,7,6,"Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready."
John,7,7,"The world cannot hate you; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil."
John,7,8,Go you 2f up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.
John,7,9,"When he had said these words unto them, he abode [still] in Galil [circuit, district]."
John,7,10,"But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret."
John,7,11,"Then the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?"
John,7,12,"And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceives the people."
John,7,13,However no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah].
John,7,14,"Now about the midst of the feast Yeshua [God is Salvation] went up into the temple, and taught."
John,7,15,"And the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] marvelled, saying, How knows this man letters, having never learned?"
John,7,16,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them, and said, My doctrine is not my, but his that sent me."
John,7,17,"If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God-The Father, or [whether] I speak of myself."
John,7,18,"He that speaks of himself seeks his own glory: but he that seeks his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him."
John,7,19,"Did not Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] give you the law, and [yet] none of you keeps the law? Why go you 2f about to kill me?"
John,7,20,"The people answered and said, you i have a devil: who goes about to kill you i?"
John,7,21,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and you 2f all marvel."
John,7,22,"Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , but of the fathers;) and you 2f on the Shabbat [rest] day circumcise a man."
John,7,23,"If a man on the Shabbat [rest] day receive circumcision, that the law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] should not be broken; are you 2f angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the Shabbat [rest] day?"
John,7,24,"Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment."
John,7,25,"Then said some of them of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?"
John,7,26,"But, lo, he speaks boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Moshiach [Messiah]?"
John,7,27,"However we know this man from what place he is: but when Moshiach [Messiah] comes, no man knows from what place he is."
John,7,28,"Then cried Yeshua [God is Salvation] in the temple as he taught, saying, You 2f both know me, and you 2f know from what place I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you 2f know not."
John,7,29,"But I know him: for I am from him, and he has sent me."
John,7,30,"Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come."
John,7,31,"And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Moshiach [Messiah] comes, will he do more miracles than these which this [man] has done?"
John,7,32,The P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
John,7,33,"Then said Yeshua [God is Salvation] unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and [then] I go unto him that sent me."
John,7,34,"You 2f shall seek me, and shall not find [me] : and where I am, [there] you 2f cannot come."
John,7,35,"Then said the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Goyim [Gentiles] , and teach the Goyim [Gentiles]?"
John,7,36,"What [manner of] saying is this that he said, You 2f shall seek me, and shall not find [me] : and where I am, [there] you 2f cannot come?"
John,7,37,"In the last day, that great [day] of the feast, Yeshua [God is Salvation] stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink."
John,7,38,"He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water."
John,7,39,"(But this spoke he of the Spirit [Ruach] , which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] was not yet [given] ; because that Yeshua [God is Salvation] was not yet glorified.)"
John,7,40,"Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a tthis is the Prophet."
John,7,41,"Others said, This is the Moshiach [Messiah] . But some said, Shall Moshiach [Messiah] come out of Galil [circuit, district]?"
John,7,42,"Has not the scripture said, That Moshiach [Messiah] comes of the seed of David [Beloved] , and out of the town of Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] , where David [Beloved] was?"
John,7,43,So there was a division among the people because of him.
John,7,44,And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
John,7,45,"Then came the officers to the chief priests and P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist]s) [separatists] ; and they said unto them, Why have you 2f not brought him?"
John,7,46,"The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man."
John,7,47,"Then answered them the P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] , Are you 2f also deceived?"
John,7,48,Have any of the rulers or of the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] believed on him?
John,7,49,But this people who knows not the law are cursed.
John,7,50,"Nicodemus says unto them, (he that came to Yeshua [God is Salvation] by night, being one of them,)"
John,7,51,"Does our law judge [any] man, before it hear him, and know what he does?"
John,7,52,"They answered and said unto him, Are you i also of Galil [circuit, district] ? Search, and look: for out of Galil [circuit, district] arises no prophet."
John,7,53,And every man went unto his own house.
John,8,1,Yeshua [God is Salvation] went unto the Mount of Olives.
John,8,2,"And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them."
John,8,3,"And the Torah-teachers (Scribes) and P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,"
John,8,4,"They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act."
John,8,5,"Now Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what say you i?"
John,8,6,"This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Yeshua [God is Salvation] stooped down, and with [his] finger wrote on the ground, [as though he heard them not]."
John,8,7,"So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her."
John,8,8,"And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground."
John,8,9,"And they which heard [it] , being convicted by [their own] conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, [even] unto the last: and Yeshua [God is Salvation] was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst."
John,8,10,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those your i accusers? has no man condemned you i?"
John,8,11,"She said, No man, Lord - Kurios. And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto her, Neither do I condemn you i : go, and sin no more."
John,8,12,"Then spoke Yeshua [God is Salvation] again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
John,8,13,"The P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] therefore said unto him, you i bear record of yourself; your i record is not true."
John,8,14,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, [yet] my record is true: for I know from what place I came, and to which I go; but you 2f cannot tell from what place I come, and to which I go."
John,8,15,You 2f judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
John,8,16,"And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me."
John,8,17,"It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true."
John,8,18,"I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me bears witness of me."
John,8,19,"Then said they unto him, Where is your i Father? Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered, You 2f neither know me, nor my Father: if you 2f had known me, you 2f should have known my Father also."
John,8,20,"These words spoke Yeshua [God is Salvation] in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come."
John,8,21,"Then said Yeshua [God is Salvation] again unto them, I go my way, and you 2f shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: to which I go, you 2f cannot come."
John,8,22,"Then said the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , Will he kill himself? because he says, Where I go, you 2f cannot come."
John,8,23,"And he said unto them, You 2f are from beneath; I am from above: you 2f are of this world; I am not of this world."
John,8,24,"I said therefore unto you, that you 2f shall die in your sins: for if you 2f believe not that I am [he] , you 2f shall die in your sins."
John,8,25,"Then said they unto him, Who are you i ? And Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto them, Even [the same] that I said unto you from the beginning."
John,8,26,I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.
John,8,27,They understood not that he spoke to them of the Father.
John,8,28,"Then said Yeshua [God is Salvation] unto them, When you 2f have lifted up the Son of Man, then shall you 2f know that I am [he] , and [that] I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things."
John,8,29,And he that sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.
John,8,30,"As he spoke these words, many believed on him."
John,8,31,"Then said Yeshua [God is Salvation] to those Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] which believed on him, If you 2f continue in my word, [then] are you 2f my disciples indeed;"
John,8,32,"And you 2f shall know the truth, and the tshall make you free."
John,8,33,"They answered him, We be Avraham [Exalted Father] ’s [Exalted Father] seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how say you i , You 2f shall be made free?"
John,8,34,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them, Truly, truly, I say unto you, Whosoever commit sin is the slave of sin."
John,8,35,And the slave abides not in the house forever: [but] the Son abides ever.
John,8,36,"If the Son therefore shall make you free, you 2f shall be free indeed."
John,8,37,"I know that you 2f are Avraham [Exalted Father] ’s [Exalted Father] seed; but you 2f seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you."
John,8,38,I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you 2f do that which you 2f have seen with your father.
John,8,39,"They answered and said unto him, Avraham [Exalted Father] is our father. Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto them, If you 2f were Avraham [Exalted Father] ’s [Exalted Father] children, you 2f would do the works of Avraham [Exalted Father]."
John,8,40,"But now you 2f seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God-The Father: this did not Avraham [Exalted Father]."
John,8,41,"You 2f do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God-The Father."
John,8,42,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto them, If God-The Father were your Father, you 2f would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God-The Father; neither came I of myself, but he sent me."
John,8,43,Why do you 2f not understand my speech? [even] because you 2f cannot hear my word.
John,8,44,"You 2f are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father you 2f will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no tin him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it."
John,8,45,"And because I tell [you] the truth, you 2f believe me not."
John,8,46,"Which of you convinces me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you 2f not believe me?"
John,8,47,"He that is of God-The Father hears God-The Father’s words: you 2f therefore hear [them] not, because you 2f are not of God-The Father."
John,8,48,"Then answered the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , and said unto him, Say we not well that you i are a Shomroni [watch-mountain] , and have a devil?"
John,8,49,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and you 2f do dishonour me."
John,8,50,And I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeks and judges.
John,8,51,"Truly, truly, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death."
John,8,52,"Then said the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] unto him, Now we know that you i have a devil. Avraham [Exalted Father] is dead, and the prophets; and you i say, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death."
John,8,53,"Are you i greater than our father Avraham [Exalted Father] , which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makes you i yourself?"
John,8,54,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honours me; of whom you 2f say, that he is your God-The Father:"
John,8,55,"Yet you 2f have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying."
John,8,56,"Your father Avraham [Exalted Father] rejoiced to see my day: and he saw [it] , and was glad."
John,8,57,"Then said the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] unto him, you i are not yet fifty years old, and have you i seen Avraham [Exalted Father]?"
John,8,58,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto them, Truly, truly, I say unto you, Before Avraham [Exalted Father] was, I am."
John,8,59,"Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Yeshua [God is Salvation] hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by."
John,9,1,"And as [Yeshua [God is Salvation] ] passed by, he saw a man which was blind from [his] birth."
John,9,2,"And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?"
John,9,3,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God-The Father should be made manifest in him."
John,9,4,"I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work."
John,9,5,"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
John,9,6,"When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,"
John,9,7,"And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing."
John,9,8,"The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?"
John,9,9,"Some said, This is he: others [said] , He is like him: [but] he said, I am [he]."
John,9,10,"Therefore said they unto him, How were you i eyes opened?"
John,9,11,"He answered and said, A man that is called Yeshua [God is Salvation] made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight."
John,9,12,"Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not."
John,9,13,They brought to the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] him that aforetime was blind.
John,9,14,"And it was the Shabbat [rest] day when Yeshua [God is Salvation] made the clay, and opened his eyes."
John,9,15,"Then again the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and do see."
John,9,16,"Therefore said some of the P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] , This man is not of God-The Father, because he keeps not the Shabbat [rest] day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them."
John,9,17,"They say unto the blind man again, What say you i of him, that he has opened your i eyes? He said, He is a prophet."
John,9,18,"But the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight."
John,9,19,"And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who you 2f say was born blind? how then does he now see?"
John,9,20,"His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:"
John,9,21,"But by what means he now sees, we know not; or who has opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself."
John,9,22,"These [words] spoke his parents, because they feared the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] : for the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Moshiach [Messiah] , he should be put out of the synagogue."
John,9,23,"Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him."
John,9,24,"Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God-The Father the praise: we know that this man is a sinner."
John,9,25,"He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner [or no] , I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see."
John,9,26,"Then said they to him again, What did he to you i ? how opened he your i eyes?"
John,9,27,"He answered them, I have told you already, and you 2f did not hear: wherefore would you 2f hear [it] again? will you 2f also be his disciples?"
John,9,28,"Then they reviled him, and said, you i are his disciple; but we are Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] ’ disciples."
John,9,29,"We know that God-The Father spoke unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]: [as for] this [fellow] , we know not from what place he is."
John,9,30,"The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that you 2f know not from what place he is, and [yet] he has opened my eyes."
John,9,31,"Now we know that God-The Father hears not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God-The Father, and does his will, him he hears."
John,9,32,Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
John,9,33,"If this man were not of God-The Father, he could do nothing."
John,9,34,"They answered and said unto him, you i were altogether born in sins, and do you i teach us? And they cast him out."
John,9,35,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Do you i believe on the Son of God-The Father?"
John,9,36,"He answered and said, Who is he, Lord - Kurios, that I might believe on him?"
John,9,37,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto him, you i have both seen him, and it is he that talks with you i."
John,9,38,"And he said, Lord - Kurios, I believe. And he worshipped him."
John,9,39,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind."
John,9,40,"And [some] of the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?"
John,9,41,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto them, If you 2f were blind, you 2f should have no sin: but now you 2f say, We see; therefore your sin remains."
John,10,1,"Truly, truly, I say unto you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber."
John,10,2,But he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
John,10,3,"To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out."
John,10,4,"And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice."
John,10,5,"And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers."
John,10,6,This parable spoke Yeshua [God is Salvation] unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spoke unto them.
John,10,7,"Then said Yeshua [God is Salvation] unto them again, Truly, truly, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep."
John,10,8,All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
John,10,9,"I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture."
John,10,10,"The thief comes not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have [it] more abundantly."
John,10,11,I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.
John,10,12,"But he that is an employee (hired laborer) , and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep."
John,10,13,"The employee (hired laborer) flees, because he is an employee (hired laborer) , and cares not for the sheep."
John,10,14,"I am the good shepherd, and know my [sheep] , and am known of my."
John,10,15,"As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep."
John,10,16,"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, [and] one shepherd."
John,10,17,"Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again."
John,10,18,"No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father."
John,10,19,There was a division therefore again among the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] for these sayings.
John,10,20,"And many of them said, He has a devil, and is mad; why hear you 2f him?"
John,10,21,"Others said, These are not the words of him that has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?"
John,10,22,"And it was at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] the feast of the dedication, and it was winter."
John,10,23,And Yeshua [God is Salvation] walked in the temple in Shlomo [peace] ’s (Solomon) [peace] porch.
John,10,24,"Then came the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] round about him, and said unto him, How long do you i make us to doubt? If you i be the Moshiach [Messiah] , tell us plainly."
John,10,25,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them, I told you, and you 2f believed not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me."
John,10,26,"But you 2f believe not, because you 2f are not of my sheep, as I said unto you."
John,10,27,"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:"
John,10,28,"And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any [man] pluck them out of my hand."
John,10,29,"My Father, which gave [them] me, is greater than all; and no [man] is able to pluck [them] out of my Father’s hand."
John,10,30,I and [my] Father are one.
John,10,31,Then the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] took up stones again to stone him.
John,10,32,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them, Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do you 2f stone me?"
John,10,33,"The Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] answered him, saying, For a good work we stone you i not; but for blasphemy; and because that you i , being a man, makes yourself God-The Father."
John,10,34,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You 2f are gods?"
John,10,35,"If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God-The Father came, and the scripture cannot be broken;"
John,10,36,"Say you 2f of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, you i blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God-The Father?"
John,10,37,"If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not."
John,10,38,"But if I do, though you 2f believe not me, believe the works: that you 2f may know, and believe, that the Father [is] in me, and I in him."
John,10,39,"Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,"
John,10,40,And went away again beyond Yarden [descender] into the place where Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] at first baptized; and there he abode.
John,10,41,"And many resorted unto him, and said, Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] did no miracle: but all things that Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] spoke of this man were true."
John,10,42,And many believed on him there.
John,11,1,"Now a certain [man] was sick, [named] El’azar [whom God helps] , of Beit-Anyah [house of figs] , the town of Miryam [waters of strength] and her sister Marta [she was rebellious]."
John,11,2,"(It was [that] Miryam [waters of strength] which anointed the Lord - Kurios with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother El’azar [whom God helps] was sick.)"
John,11,3,"Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord - Kurios, behold, he whom you i love is sick."
John,11,4,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] heard [that] , he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God-The Father, that the Son of God-The Father might be glorified thereby."
John,11,5,"Now Yeshua [God is Salvation] loved Marta [she was rebellious] , and her sister, and El’azar [whom God helps]."
John,11,6,"When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was."
John,11,7,"Then after that says he to [his] disciples, Let us go into Y’hudah [praised] again."
John,11,8," [His] disciples say unto him, Master, the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] of late sought to stone you i ; and go you i there again?"
John,11,9,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world."
John,11,10,"But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him."
John,11,11,"These things said he: and after that he says unto them, Our friend El’azar [whom God helps] sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep."
John,11,12,"Then said his disciples, Lord - Kurios, if he sleep, he shall do well."
John,11,13,However Yeshua [God is Salvation] spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
John,11,14,"Then said Yeshua [God is Salvation] unto them plainly, El’azar [whom God helps] is dead."
John,11,15,"And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent you 2f may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him."
John,11,16,"Then said T’oma [twin] , which is called Didymus [two-fold] , unto his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him."
John,11,17,"Then when Yeshua [God is Salvation] came, he found that he had [lain] in the grave four days already."
John,11,18,"Now Beit-Anyah [house of figs] was near unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , about fifteen furlongs off:"
John,11,19,"And many of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] came to Marta [she was rebellious] and Miryam [waters of strength] , to comfort them concerning their brother."
John,11,20,"Then Marta [she was rebellious] , as soon as she heard that Yeshua [God is Salvation] was coming, went and met him: but Miryam [waters of strength] sat [still] in the house."
John,11,21,"Then said Marta [she was rebellious] unto Yeshua [God is Salvation] , Lord - Kurios, if you i had been here, my brother had not died."
John,11,22,"But I know, that even now, whatsoever you i will ask of God-The Father, God-The Father will give [it] you i."
John,11,23,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto her, You 1s brother shall rise again."
John,11,24,"Marta [she was rebellious] says unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
John,11,25,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:"
John,11,26,And whosoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Believe you i this?
John,11,27,"She says unto him, Yes, Lord - Kurios: I believe that you i are the Moshiach [Messiah] , the Son of God-The Father, which should come into the world."
John,11,28,"And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Miryam [waters of strength] her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calls for you i."
John,11,29,"As soon as she heard [that] , she arose quickly, and came unto him."
John,11,30,"Now Yeshua [God is Salvation] was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Marta [she was rebellious] met him."
John,11,31,"The Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Miryam [waters of strength] , that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goes unto the grave to weep there."
John,11,32,"Then when Miryam [waters of strength] was come where Yeshua [God is Salvation] was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord - Kurios, if you i had been here, my brother had not died."
John,11,33,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] therefore saw her weeping, and the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the Spirit [Ruach] , and was troubled,"
John,11,34,"And said, Where have you 2f laid him? They said unto him, Lord - Kurios, come and see."
John,11,35,Yeshua [God is Salvation] wept.
John,11,36,"Then said the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , Behold how he loved him!"
John,11,37,"And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?"
John,11,38,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] therefore again groaning in himself comes to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it."
John,11,39,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] said, Take you 2f away the stone. Marta [she was rebellious] , the sister of him that was dead, says unto him, Lord - Kurios, by this time he stinks: for he has been [dead] four days."
John,11,40,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto her, Said I not unto you i , that, if you i would believe, you i should see the glory of God-The Father?"
John,11,41,"Then they took away the stone [from the place] where the dead was laid. And Yeshua [God is Salvation] lifted up [his] eyes, and said, Father, I thank you i that you i have heard me."
John,11,42,"And I knew that you i hear me always: but because of the people which stand by I said [it] , that they may believe that you i have sent me."
John,11,43,"And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, El’azar [whom God helps] , come forth."
John,11,44,"And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto them, Loose him, and let him go."
John,11,45,"Then many of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] which came to Miryam [waters of strength] , and had seen the things which Yeshua [God is Salvation] did, believed on him."
John,11,46,"But some of them went their ways to the P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] , and told them what things Yeshua [God is Salvation] had done."
John,11,47,"Then gathered the chief priests and the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many miracles."
John,11,48,"If we let him thus alone, all [men] will believe on him: and the Romans [strength] shall come and take away both our place and nation."
John,11,49,"And one of them, [named] Kayafa [depression] , being the High Priest that same year, said unto them, You 2f know nothing at all,"
John,11,50,"Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not."
John,11,51,"And this spoke he not of himself: but being High Priest that year, he prophesied that Yeshua [God is Salvation] should die for that nation;"
John,11,52,"And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God-The Father that were scattered abroad."
John,11,53,Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.
John,11,54,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] therefore walked no more openly among the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] ; but went there unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Efrayim [Doubly Fruitful] , and there continued with his disciples."
John,11,55,"And the Y’hudit (Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] ) Passover was near at hand: and many went out of the country up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] before the Passover, to purify themselves."
John,11,56,"Then sought they for Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think you 2f , that he will not come to the feast?"
John,11,57,"Now both the chief priests and the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should show [it] , that they might take him."
John,12,1,"Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] six days before the Passover came to Beit-Anyah [house of figs] , where El’azar [whom God helps] was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead."
John,12,2,There they made him a supper; and Marta [she was rebellious] served: but El’azar [whom God helps] was one of them that sat at the table with him.
John,12,3,"Then took Miryam [waters of strength] a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment."
John,12,4,"Then says one of his disciples, Y’hudah [praised] From K’riot [cities] , Shim’on [he has heard] ’s [son] , which should betray him,"
John,12,5,"Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?"
John,12,6,"This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put in it."
John,12,7,"Then said Yeshua [God is Salvation] , Let her alone: against the day of my burying has she kept this."
John,12,8,For the poor always you 2f have with you; but me you 2f have not always.
John,12,9,"Much people of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Yeshua [God is Salvation] ’ sake only, but that they might see El’azar [whom God helps] also, whom he had raised from the dead."
John,12,10,But the chief priests consulted that they might put El’azar [whom God helps] also to death;
John,12,11,"Because that by reason of him many of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] went away, and believed on Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
John,12,12,"On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Yeshua [God is Salvation] was coming to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace],"
John,12,13,"Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [is] the King of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] that comes in the name of the Lord - Kurios."
John,12,14,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] , when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,"
John,12,15,"Fear not, daughter of Tziyon [a parched place] [Lofty] : behold, your i King comes, sitting on an ass’s colt."
John,12,16,"These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Yeshua [God is Salvation] was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and [that] they had done these things unto him."
John,12,17,"The people therefore that was with him when he called El’azar [whom God helps] out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bore record."
John,12,18,"For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle."
John,12,19,"The P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] therefore said among themselves, Perceive you 2f how you 2f prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him."
John,12,20,And there were certain Greeks [unstable: miry ones] among them that came up to worship at the feast:
John,12,21,"The same came therefore to Philip [friend of horses] , which was of Beit-Tzaidah [house of fish] of Galil [circuit, district] , and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
John,12,22,Philip [friend of horses] comes and tells Andrew [of a man] : and again Andrew [of a man] and Philip [friend of horses] tell Yeshua [God is Salvation].
John,12,23,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of Man should be glorified."
John,12,24,"Truly, truly, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit."
John,12,25,He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
John,12,26,"If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my slave be: if any man serve me, him will [my] Father honour."
John,12,27,"Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour."
John,12,28,"Father, glorify your i name. Then came there a voice from heaven, [saying] , I have both glorified [it] , and will glorify [it] again."
John,12,29,"The people therefore, that stood by, and heard [it] , said that it thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him."
John,12,30,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes."
John,12,31,Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
John,12,32,"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all [men] unto me."
John,12,33,"This he said, signifying what death he should die."
John,12,34,"The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Moshiach [Messiah] abides forever: and how say you i , The Son of Man must be lifted up? who is this Son of Man?"
John,12,35,"Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while you 2f have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walks in darkness knows not to which he goes."
John,12,36,"While you 2f have light, believe in the light, that you 2f may be the children of light. These things spoke Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and departed, and did hide himself from them."
John,12,37,"But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:"
John,12,38,"That the saying of Yesha’yahu [Yah is salvation] the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord - Kurios, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord - Kurios been revealed?"
John,12,39,"Therefore they could not believe, because that Yesha’yahu [Yah is salvation] said again,"
John,12,40,"He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with [their] eyes, nor understand with [their] heart, and be converted, and I should heal them."
John,12,41,"These things said Yesha’yahu [Yah is salvation] , when he saw his glory, and spoke of him."
John,12,42,"Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] they did not confess [him] , lest they should be put out of the synagogue:"
John,12,43,For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God-The Father.
John,12,44,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me."
John,12,45,And he that sees me sees him that sent me.
John,12,46,"I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believes on me should not abide in darkness."
John,12,47,"And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world."
John,12,48,"He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day."
John,12,49,"For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak."
John,12,50,"And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak."
John,13,1,"Now before the feast of the Passover, when Yeshua [God is Salvation] knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end."
John,13,2,"And supper during supper, the devil having now put into the heart of Y’hudah [praised] From K’riot [cities] , Shim’on [he has heard] ’s [son] , to betray him;"
John,13,3,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God-The Father, and went to God-The Father;"
John,13,4,"He rises from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself."
John,13,5,"After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe [them] with the towel which he was girded."
John,13,6,"Then comes he to Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] : and Kefa [pebble] says unto him, Lord - Kurios, do you i wash my feet?"
John,13,7,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto him, What I do you i know not now; but you i shall know hereafter."
John,13,8,"Kefa [pebble] says unto him, you i shall never wash my feet. Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered him, If I wash you i not, you i have no part with me."
John,13,9,"Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] says unto him, Lord - Kurios, not my feet only, but also [my] hands and [my] head."
John,13,10,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says to him, He that is washed needs not save to wash [his] feet, but is clean every whit: and you 2f are clean, but not all."
John,13,11,"For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, You 2f are not all clean."
John,13,12,"So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know you 2f what I have done to you?"
John,13,13,You 2f call me Master and Lord - Kurios: and you 2f say well; for [so] I am.
John,13,14,"If I then, [your] Lord - Kurios and Master, have washed your feet; you 2f also ought to wash one another’s feet."
John,13,15,"For I have given you an example, that you 2f should do as I have done to you."
John,13,16,"Truly, truly, I say unto you, The slave is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him."
John,13,17,"If you 2f know these things, happy are you 2f if you 2f do them."
John,13,18,"I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me."
John,13,19,"Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, you 2f may believe that I am [he]."
John,13,20,"Truly, truly, I say unto you, He that receives whomsoever I send receives me; and he that receives me receives him that sent me."
John,13,21,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] had thus said, he was troubled in Spirit [Ruach] , and testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me."
John,13,22,"Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke."
John,13,23,"Now there was leaning on Yeshua [God is Salvation] ’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Yeshua [God is Salvation] loved."
John,13,24,"Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spoke."
John,13,25,"He then lying on Yeshua [God is Salvation] ’ breast says unto him, Lord - Kurios, who is it?"
John,13,26,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop (a morsel of bread to be dipped) , when I have dipped [it] . And when he had dipped the sop (a morsel of bread to be dipped) , he gave [it] to Y’hudah [praised] From K’riot [cities], [the son] of Shim’on [he has heard]."
John,13,27,"And after the sop (a morsel of bread to be dipped) Satan [the adversary] entered into him. Then said Yeshua [God is Salvation] unto him, That you i do, do quickly."
John,13,28,Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this unto him.
John,13,29,"For some [of them] thought, because Y’hudah [praised] had the bag, that Yeshua [God is Salvation] had said unto him, Buy [those things] that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor."
John,13,30,He then having received the sop (a morsel of bread to be dipped) went immediately out: and it was night.
John,13,31,"Therefore, when he was gone out, Yeshua [God is Salvation] said, Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God-The Father is glorified in him."
John,13,32,"If God-The Father be glorified in him, God-The Father shall also glorify him in himself, and shall immediately glorify him."
John,13,33,"Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You 2f shall seek me: and as I said unto the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , Where I go, you 2f cannot come; so now I say to you."
John,13,34,"A new commandment I give unto you, That you 2f love one another; as I have loved you, that you 2f also love one another."
John,13,35,"By this shall all [men] know that you 2f are my disciples, if you 2f have love one to another."
John,13,36,"Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] said unto him, Lord - Kurios, to which go you i ? Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered him, Where I go, you i can not follow me now; but you i shall follow me afterwards."
John,13,37,"Kefa [pebble] said unto him, Lord - Kurios, why cannot I follow you i now? I will lay down my life for your i sake."
John,13,38,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered him, Will you i lay down your i life for my sake? Truly, truly, I say unto you i , The cock shall not crow, till you i have denied me thrice."
John,14,1,"Let not your heart be troubled: you 2f believe in God-The Father, believe also in me."
John,14,2,"In my Father’s house are many offices: if [it were] not [so] , I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you."
John,14,3,"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, [there] you 2f may be also."
John,14,4,"And to which I go you 2f know, and the way you 2f know."
John,14,5,"T’oma [twin] says unto him, Lord - Kurios, we know not to which you i go; and how can we know the way?"
John,14,6,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes unto the Father, but by me."
John,14,7,"If you 2f had known me, you 2f should have known my Father also: and from from this time forth (from now on) you 2f know him, and have seen him."
John,14,8,"Philip [friend of horses] says unto him, Lord - Kurios, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us."
John,14,9,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you i not known me, Philip [friend of horses] ? he that has seen me has seen the Father; and how say you i [then] , Show us the Father?"
John,14,10,"Believe you i not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works."
John,14,11,"Believe me that I [am] in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake."
John,14,12,"Truly, truly, I say unto you, He that believes on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater [works] than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father."
John,14,13,"And whatsoever you 2f shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son."
John,14,14,"If you 2f shall ask any thing in my name, I will do [it]."
John,14,15,"If you 2f love me, keep my commandments."
John,14,16,"And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever;"
John,14,17," [Even] the Spirit [Ruach] of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but you 2f know him; for he dwells with you, and shall be in you."
John,14,18,I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
John,14,19,"Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you 2f see me: because I live, you 2f shall live also."
John,14,20,"At that day you 2f shall know that I [am] in my Father, and you 2f in me, and I in you."
John,14,21,"He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him."
John,14,22,"Y’hudah [praised] says unto him, not From K’riot [cities] , Lord - Kurios, how is it that you i will manifest yourself unto us, and not unto the world?"
John,14,23,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him."
John,14,24,"He that loves me not keeps not my sayings: and the word which you 2f hear is not my, but the Father’s which sent me."
John,14,25,"These things have I spoken unto you, being [yet] present with you."
John,14,26,"But the Comforter, [which is] the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] , whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you."
John,14,27,"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world gives, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."
John,14,28,"You 2f have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come [again] unto you. If you 2f loved me, you 2f would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I."
John,14,29,"And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, you 2f might believe."
John,14,30,"Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me."
John,14,31,"But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence."
John,15,1,"I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer (or rancher)."
John,15,2,"Every branch in me that bears not fruit he takes away: and every [branch] that bears fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit."
John,15,3,Now you 2f are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
John,15,4,"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can you 2f , except you 2f abide in me."
John,15,5,"I am the vine, you 2f [are] the branches: He that abides in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without me you 2f can do nothing."
John,15,6,"If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast [them] into the fire, and they are burned."
John,15,7,"If you 2f abide in me, and my words abide in you, you 2f shall ask what you 2f will, and it shall be done unto you."
John,15,8,"Herein is my Father glorified, that you 2f bear much fruit; so shall you 2f be my disciples."
John,15,9,"As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you: continue you 2f in my love."
John,15,10,"If you 2f keep my commandments, you 2f shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love."
John,15,11,"These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and [that] your joy might be full."
John,15,12,"This is my commandment, That you 2f love one another, as I have loved you."
John,15,13,"Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."
John,15,14,"You 2f are my friends, if you 2f do whatsoever I command you."
John,15,15,From this time forth (from now on) I call you not servants; for the slave knows not what his lord does: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
John,15,16,"You 2f have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you 2f should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain: that whatsoever you 2f shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you."
John,15,17,"These things I command you, that you 2f love one another."
John,15,18,"If the world hate you, you 2f know that it hated me before [it hated] you."
John,15,19,"If you 2f were of the world, the world would love his own: but because you 2f are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you."
John,15,20,"Remember the word that I said unto you, The slave is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also."
John,15,21,"But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me."
John,15,22,"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin."
John,15,23,He that hates me hates my Father also.
John,15,24,"If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father."
John,15,25,"But [this comes to pass] , that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause."
John,15,26,"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, [even] the Spirit [Ruach] of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:"
John,15,27,"And you 2f also shall bear witness, because you 2f have been with me from the beginning."
John,16,1,"These things have I spoken unto you, that you 2f should not be offended."
John,16,2,"They shall put you out of the synagogues: yes, the time comes, that whosoever kills you will think that he does God-The Father service."
John,16,3,"And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me."
John,16,4,"But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, you 2f may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you."
John,16,5,"But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asks me, Where go you i?"
John,16,6,"But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow has filled your heart."
John,16,7,"Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you."
John,16,8,"And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:"
John,16,9,"Of sin, because they believe not on me;"
John,16,10,"Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you 2f see me no more;"
John,16,11,"Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged."
John,16,12,"I have yet many things to say unto you, but you 2f cannot bear them now."
John,16,13,"However when he, the Spirit [Ruach] of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, [that] shall he speak: and he will show you things to come."
John,16,14,"He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of my, and shall show [it] unto you."
John,16,15,"All things that the Father has are my: therefore said I, that he shall take of my, and shall show [it] unto you."
John,16,16,"A little while, and you 2f shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you 2f shall see me, because I go to the Father."
John,16,17,"Then said [some] of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he says unto us, A little while, and you 2f shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you 2f shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?"
John,16,18,"They said therefore, What is this that he says, A little while? we cannot tell what he says."
John,16,19,"Now Yeshua [God is Salvation] knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do you 2f enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and you 2f shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you 2f shall see me?"
John,16,20,"Truly, truly, I say unto you, That you 2f shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and you 2f shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy."
John,16,21,"A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world."
John,16,22,"And you 2f now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man takes from you."
John,16,23,"And in that day you 2f shall ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say unto you, Whatsoever you 2f shall ask the Father in my name, he will give [it] you."
John,16,24,"Till this point in time have you 2f asked nothing in my name: ask, and you 2f shall receive, that your joy may be full."
John,16,25,"These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time comes, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father."
John,16,26,"At that day you 2f shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:"
John,16,27,"For the Father himself loves you, because you 2f have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God-The Father."
John,16,28,"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father."
John,16,29,"His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speak you i plainly, and speak no proverb."
John,16,30,"Now are we sure that you i know all things, and need not that any man should ask you i : by this we believe that you i came forth from God-The Father."
John,16,31,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them, Do you 2f now believe?"
John,16,32,"Behold, the hour comes, yes, is now come, that you 2f shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me."
John,16,33,"These things I have spoken unto you, that in me you 2f might have peace. In the world you 2f shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."
John,17,1,"These words spoke Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify your i Son, that your i Son also may glorify you i:"
John,17,2,"As you i have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you i have given him."
John,17,3,"And this is life eternal, that they might know you i the only true God-The Father, and Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , whom you i have sent."
John,17,4,I have glorified you i on the earth: I have finished the work which you i gave me to do.
John,17,5,"And now, O Father, glorify you i me with your i own self with the glory which I had with you i before the world was."
John,17,6,"I have manifested your i name unto the men which you i gave me out of the world: yoursi they were, and you i gave them me; and they have kept your i word."
John,17,7,Now they have known that all things whatsoever you i have given me are of you i.
John,17,8,"For I have given unto them the words which you i gave me; and they have received [them] , and have known surely that I came out from you i , and they have believed that you i did send me."
John,17,9,"I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which you i have given me; for they are yoursi."
John,17,10,"And all mine are yoursi, and yoursi are mine; and I am glorified in them."
John,17,11,"And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to you i . Holy Father, keep through your i own name those whom you i have given me, that they may be one, as we [are]."
John,17,12,"While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your i name: those that you i gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled."
John,17,13,"And now come I to you i ; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves."
John,17,14,"I have given them your i word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."
John,17,15,"I pray not that you i should take them out of the world, but that you i should keep them from the evil."
John,17,16,"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."
John,17,17,Sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) them through your i truth: your i word is truth.
John,17,18,"As you i have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world."
John,17,19,"And for their sakes I sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth."
John,17,20,"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;"
John,17,21,"That they all may be one; as you i , Father, [are] in me, and I in you i , that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you i have sent me."
John,17,22,"And the glory which you i gave me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:"
John,17,23,"I in them, and you i in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that you i have sent me, and have loved them, as you i have loved me."
John,17,24,"Father, I will that they also, whom you i have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you i have given me: for you i loved me before the foundation of the world."
John,17,25,"O righteous Father, the world has not known you i : but I have known you i , and these have known that you i have sent me."
John,17,26,"And I have declared unto them your i name, and will declare [it] : that the love which you i have loved me may be in them, and I in them."
John,18,1,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron [turbid] , where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples."
John,18,2,"And Y’hudah [praised] also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Yeshua [God is Salvation] ofttimes resorted there with his disciples."
John,18,3,"Y’hudah [praised] then, having received a band [of men] and officers from the chief priests and P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] , comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons."
John,18,4,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek you 2f?"
John,18,5,"They answered him, Yeshua [God is Salvation] of Natzeret [one separated] . Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto them, I am [he] . And Y’hudah [praised] also, which betrayed him, stood with them."
John,18,6,"As soon then as he had said unto them, I am [he] , they went backward, and fell to the ground."
John,18,7,"Then asked he them again, Whom seek you 2f ? And they said, Yeshua [God is Salvation] of Natzeret [one separated]."
John,18,8,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered, I have told you that I am [he] : if therefore you 2f seek me, let these go their way:"
John,18,9,"That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Of them which you i gave me have I lost none."
John,18,10,"Then Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest’s slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave’s name was Melekh [king]."
John,18,11,"Then said Yeshua [God is Salvation] unto Kefa [pebble] , Put [a bow] up your i sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?"
John,18,12,"Then the band and the captain and officers of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] took Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and bound him,"
John,18,13,"And led him away to ‘Anan [humble] first; for he was father in law to Kayafa [depression] , which was the High Priest that same year."
John,18,14,"Now Kayafa [depression] was he, which gave counsel to the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people."
John,18,15,"And Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] followed Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and [so did] another disciple: that disciple was known unto the High Priest, and went in with Yeshua [God is Salvation] into the palace of the High Priest."
John,18,16,"But Kefa [pebble] stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the High Priest, and spoke unto her that kept the door, and brought in Kefa [pebble]."
John,18,17,"Then says the girl that kept the door unto Kefa [pebble] , Are not you i also [one] of this man’s disciples? He says, I am not."
John,18,18,"And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Kefa [pebble] stood with them, and warmed himself."
John,18,19,"The High Priest then asked Yeshua [God is Salvation] of his disciples, and of his doctrine."
John,18,20,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, to which the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] always resort; and in secret have I said nothing."
John,18,21,"Why ask you i me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said."
John,18,22,"And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Yeshua [God is Salvation] with the palm of his hand, saying, Answer you i the High Priest so?"
John,18,23,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why strike you i me?"
John,18,24,Now ‘Anan [humble] had sent him bound unto Kayafa [depression] the High Priest.
John,18,25,"And Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Are not you i also [one] of his disciples? He denied [it] , and said, I am not."
John,18,26,"One of the servants of the High Priest, being [his] kinsman whose ear Kefa [pebble] cut off, says, Did not I see you i in the garden with him?"
John,18,27,Kefa [pebble] then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
John,18,28,"Then led they Yeshua [God is Salvation] from Kayafa [depression] unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the Passover."
John,18,29,"Pilate [armed with a spear] then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring you 2f against this man?"
John,18,30,"They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto you i."
John,18,31,"Then said Pilate [armed with a spear] unto them, Take you 2f him, and judge him according to your law. The Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:"
John,18,32,"That the saying of Yeshua [God is Salvation] might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying what death he should die."
John,18,33,"Then Pilate [armed with a spear] entered into the judgment hall again, and called Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and said unto him, Are you i the King of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah]?"
John,18,34,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered him, Say you i this thing of yourself, or did others tell it you i of me?"
John,18,35,"Pilate [armed with a spear] answered, Am I a Jewish person? You 1s own nation and the chief priests have delivered you i unto me: what have you i done?"
John,18,36,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] : but now is my kingdom not from hence."
John,18,37,"Pilate [armed with a spear] therefore said unto him, Are you i a king then? Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered, you i say that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the thears my voice."
John,18,38,"Pilate [armed with a spear] says unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , and says unto them, I find in him no fault [at all]."
John,18,39,"But you 2f have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the Passover: will you 2f therefore that I release unto you the King of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah]?"
John,18,40,"Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Bar-Abba [son of a father] . Now Bar-Abba [son of a father] was a robber."
John,19,1,"Then Pilate [armed with a spear] therefore took Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and scourged [him]."
John,19,2,"And the soldiers braided a crown of thorns, and put [it] on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,"
John,19,3,"And said, Hail, King of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] ! and they struck him with their hands."
John,19,4,"Pilate [armed with a spear] therefore went forth again, and says unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that you 2f may know that I find no fault in him."
John,19,5,"Then came Yeshua [God is Salvation] forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And [Pilate [armed with a spear] ] says unto them, Behold the man!"
John,19,6,"When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify [him] , crucify [him] . Pilate [armed with a spear] says unto them, Take you 2f him, and crucify [him] : for I find no fault in him."
John,19,7,"The Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God-The Father."
John,19,8,"When Pilate [armed with a spear] therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;"
John,19,9,"And went again into the judgment hall, and says unto Yeshua [God is Salvation] , Whence are you i ? But Yeshua [God is Salvation] gave him no answer."
John,19,10,"Then says Pilate [armed with a spear] unto him, Speak you i not unto me? know you i not that I have power to crucify you i , and have power to release you i?"
John,19,11,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered, you i could have no power [at all] against me, except it were given you i from above: therefore he that delivered me unto you i has the greater sin."
John,19,12,"And from thenceforth Pilate [armed with a spear] sought to release him: but the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] cried out, saying, If you i let this man go, you i are not Caesar [venerable] ’s friend: whosoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar [venerable]."
John,19,13,"When Pilate [armed with a spear] therefore heard that saying, he brought Yeshua [God is Salvation] forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] , Gabbata [Pavement]."
John,19,14,"And it was the preparation of the Passover, and about the sixth hour: and he says unto the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , Behold your King!"
John,19,15,"But they cried out, Away with [him] , away with [him] , crucify him. Pilate [armed with a spear] says unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar [venerable]."
John,19,16,"Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and led [him] away."
John,19,17,"And he bearing his stake (cross) went forth into a place called [the place] of a skull, which is called in the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] Gulgolta [place of the skull]:"
John,19,18,"Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Yeshua [God is Salvation] in the midst."
John,19,19,"And Pilate [armed with a spear] wrote a title, and put [it] on the stake (cross) . And the writing was, YESHUA (GOD SAVES) OF NATZERET [ONE SEPARATED] THE KING OF THE JEWS [Praised]."
John,19,20,"This title then read many of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] : for the place where Yeshua [God is Salvation] was crucified was near to the city: and it was written in ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew], [and] Greek [unstable: the miry one], [and] Latin."
John,19,21,"Then said the chief priests of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] to Pilate [armed with a spear] , Write not, The King of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] ; but that he said, I am King of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah]."
John,19,22,"Pilate [armed with a spear] answered, What I have written I have written."
John,19,23,"Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Yeshua [God is Salvation] , took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also [his] coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout."
John,19,24,"They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend (tear apart; forcefully rip apart) it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my clothing among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did."
John,19,25,"Now there stood by the stake (cross) of Yeshua [God is Salvation] his mother, and his mother’s sister, Miryam [waters of strength] the [wife] of K’lofah [my exchanges] , and Miryam [waters of strength] Magdala [a tower]."
John,19,26,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he says unto his mother, Woman, behold your i son!"
John,19,27,"Then says he to the disciple, Behold your i mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own [home]."
John,19,28,"After this, Yeshua [God is Salvation] knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, says, I thirst."
John,19,29,"Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put [it] upon hyssop, and put [it] to his mouth."
John,19,30,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost."
John,19,31,"The Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the stake (cross) on the Shabbat [rest] day, (for that Shabbat [rest] day was an high day,) besought Pilate [armed with a spear] that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away."
John,19,32,"Then came the soldiers, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him."
John,19,33,"But when they came to Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs:"
John,19,34,"But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water."
John,19,35,"And he that saw [it] bore record, and his record is true: and he knows that he says true, that you 2f might believe."
John,19,36,"For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken."
John,19,37,"And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced."
John,19,38,"And after this Yosef [God will add] of Ramatayim [heights] , being a disciple of Yeshua [God is Salvation] , but secretly for fear of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , besought Pilate [armed with a spear] that he might take away the body of Yeshua [God is Salvation] : and Pilate [armed with a spear] gave [him] leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
John,19,39,"And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Yeshua [God is Salvation] by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound [weight]."
John,19,40,"Then took they the body of Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] is to bury."
John,19,41,"Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid."
John,19,42,There laid they Yeshua [God is Salvation] therefore because of the Y’hudit (Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah]’) preparation [day] ; for the sepulchre was near at hand.
John,20,1,"The first [day] of the week comes Miryam [waters of strength] Magdala [a tower] early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and sees the stone taken away from the sepulchre."
John,20,2,"Then she runs, and comes to Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] , and to the other disciple, whom Yeshua [God is Salvation] loved, and says unto them, They have taken away the Lord - Kurios out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him."
John,20,3,"Kefa [pebble] therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre."
John,20,4,"So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Kefa [pebble] , and came first to the sepulchre."
John,20,5,"And he stooping down, [and looking in] , saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in."
John,20,6,"Then comes Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] following him, and went into the sepulchre, and sees the linen clothes lie,"
John,20,7,"And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself."
John,20,8,"Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed."
John,20,9,"For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead."
John,20,10,Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.
John,20,11,"But Miryam [waters of strength] stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, [and looked] into the sepulchre,"
John,20,12,"And sees two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Yeshua [God is Salvation] had lain."
John,20,13,"And they say unto her, Woman, why weep you i ? She says unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord - Kurios, and I know not where they have laid him."
John,20,14,"And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Yeshua [God is Salvation] standing, and knew not that it was Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
John,20,15,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto her, Woman, why weep you i ? whom seek you i ? She, supposing him to be the gardener, says unto him, Sir, if you i have borne him hence, tell me where you i have laid him, and I will take him away."
John,20,16,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto her, Miryam [waters of strength] . She turned herself, and says unto him, Rabbani [Teacher!] ; which is to say, Master."
John,20,17,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and [to] my God-The Father, and your God-The Father."
John,20,18,"Miryam [waters of strength] Magdala [a tower] came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord - Kurios, and [that] he had spoken these things unto her."
John,20,19,"Then the same day at evening, being the first [day] of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , came Yeshua [God is Salvation] and stood in the midst, and says unto them, Peace [be] unto you."
John,20,20,"And when he had so said, he showed unto them [his] hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord - Kurios."
John,20,21,"Then said Yeshua [God is Salvation] to them again, Peace [be] unto you: as [my] Father has sent me, even so send I you."
John,20,22,"And when he had said this, he breathed on [them] , and says unto them, Receive you 2f the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh]:"
John,20,23,"Whose soever sins you 2f remit, they are remitted unto them; [and] whose soever [sins] you 2f retain, they are retained."
John,20,24,"But T’oma [twin] , one of the twelve, called Didymus [two-fold] , was not with them when Yeshua [God is Salvation] came."
John,20,25,"The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord - Kurios. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe."
John,20,26,"And after eight days again his disciples were within, and T’oma [twin] with them: [then] came Yeshua [God is Salvation] , the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace [be] unto you."
John,20,27,"Then says he to T’oma [twin] , Reach here your i finger, and behold my hands; and reach here your i hand, and thrust [it] into my side: and be not faithless, but believing."
John,20,28,"And T’oma [twin] answered and said unto him, My Lord - Kurios and my God-The Father."
John,20,29,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto him, T’oma [twin] , because you i have seen me, you i have believed: Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [are] they that have not seen, and [yet] have believed."
John,20,30,"And many other signs truly did Yeshua [God is Salvation] in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:"
John,20,31,"But these are written, that you 2f might believe that Yeshua [God is Salvation] is the Moshiach [Messiah] , the Son of God-The Father; and that believing you 2f might have life through his name."
John,21,1,After these things Yeshua [God is Salvation] showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias [from the river-god] ; and on this wise showed he [himself].
John,21,2,"There were together Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] , and T’oma [twin] called Didymus [two-fold] , and Nathanael of Kanah [place of reeds] in Galil [circuit, district] , and the [sons] of Zavdai [Yah has bestowed] , and two other of his disciples."
John,21,3,"Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] says unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with you i . They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing."
John,21,4,"But when the morning was now come, Yeshua [God is Salvation] stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
John,21,5,"Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto them, Children, have you 2f any meat? They answered him, No."
John,21,6,"And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and you 2f shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes."
John,21,7,"Therefore that disciple whom Yeshua [God is Salvation] loved says unto Kefa [pebble] , It is the Lord - Kurios. Now when Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] heard that it was the Lord - Kurios, he wrapped around [his] fisher’s coat [unto him], (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea."
John,21,8,"And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes."
John,21,9,"As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread."
John,21,10,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto them, Bring of the fish which you 2f have now caught."
John,21,11,"Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken."
John,21,12,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto them, Come [and] dine. And none of the disciples dared (was bold enough) ask him, Who are you i ? knowing that it was the Lord - Kurios."
John,21,13,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] then comes, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise."
John,21,14,"This is now the third time that Yeshua [God is Salvation] showed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead."
John,21,15,"So when they had dined, Yeshua [God is Salvation] says to Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] , Shim’on [he has heard], [son] of Yochanan [dove] , love you i me more than these? He says unto him, Yes, Lord - Kurios; you i know that I love you i . He says unto him, Feed my lambs."
John,21,16,"He says to him again the second time, Shim’on [he has heard], [son] of Yochanan [dove] , love you i me? He says unto him, Yes, Lord - Kurios; you i know that I love you i . He says unto him, Feed my sheep."
John,21,17,"He says unto him the third time, Shim’on [he has heard], [son] of Yochanan [dove] , love you i me? Kefa [pebble] was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest you i me? And he said unto him, Lord - Kurios, you i know all things; you i know that I love you i . Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto him, Feed my sheep."
John,21,18,"Truly, truly, I say unto you i , When you i were young, you i girded yourself, and walkedst to which you i would: but when you i shall be old, you i shall stretch forth your i hands, and another shall gird you i , and carry [you i ] to which you i would not."
John,21,19,"This spoke he, signifying by what death he should glorify God-The Father. And when he had spoken this, he says unto him, Follow me."
John,21,20,"Then Kefa [pebble] , turning about, sees the disciple whom Yeshua [God is Salvation] loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord - Kurios, which is he that betrays you i?"
John,21,21,"Kefa [pebble] seeing him says to Yeshua [God is Salvation] , Lord - Kurios, and what [shall] this man [do]?"
John,21,22,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto him, If I will that he wait till I come, what [is that] to you i ? follow you i me."
John,21,23,"Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Yeshua [God is Salvation] said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he wait till I come, what [is that] to you i?"
John,21,24,"This is the disciple which testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true."
John,21,25,"And there are also many other things which Yeshua [God is Salvation] did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen."
