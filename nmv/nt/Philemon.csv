Philemon,1,1,"Sha’ul [desired] , a prisoner of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , and Timothy [honoring God] [our] brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,"
Philemon,1,2,"And to [our] beloved Apphia [fruitful] , and Archippus [master of the horse] our fellowsoldier, and to the church in your i house:"
Philemon,1,3,"Grace to you, and peace, from God-The Father our Father and the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
Philemon,1,4,"I thank my God-The Father, making mention of you i always in my prayers,"
Philemon,1,5,"Hearing of your i love and faith, which you i have toward the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and toward all saints;"
Philemon,1,6,That the communication of your i faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation].
Philemon,1,7,"For we have great joy and consolation in your i love, because the bowels (inward parts; affections) of the saints are refreshed by your i , brother."
Philemon,1,8,"For what reason, though I might be much bold in Moshiach [Messiah] to command (charge) you i that which is convenient (fit; appropriate; proper (one’s own; peculiar; particular)),"
Philemon,1,9,"Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) [you i ] , being such an one as Sha’ul [desired] the aged, and now also a prisoner of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
Philemon,1,10,"I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i for my son Onesimus [profitable or useful] , whom I have begotten in my bonds:"
Philemon,1,11,"Which in time past was to you i unprofitable, but now profitable to you i and to me:"
Philemon,1,12,"Whom I have sent again: you i therefore receive him, that is, my own bowels (inward parts; affections):"
Philemon,1,13,"Whom I would have retained with me, that in your i stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the Gospel (joyful message):"
Philemon,1,14,"But without your i mind would I do nothing; that your i benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly."
Philemon,1,15,"For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that you i should receive him forever;"
Philemon,1,16,"Not now as a slave, but above a slave, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto you i , both in the flesh, and in the Lord - Kurios?"
Philemon,1,17,"If you i count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself."
Philemon,1,18,"If he has wronged you i , or owes [you i ] ought, put that on my account;"
Philemon,1,19,"I Sha’ul [desired] have written [it] with my own hand, I will repay [it] : albeit I do not say to you i how you i owe unto me even your i own self besides."
Philemon,1,20,"Yes, brother, let me have joy of you i in the Lord - Kurios: refresh my bowels (inward parts; affections) in the Lord - Kurios."
Philemon,1,21,"Having confidence in your i obedience I wrote unto you i , knowing that you i will also do more than I say."
Philemon,1,22,But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
Philemon,1,23,"There salute you i Epaphras [lovely] , my fellowprisoner in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation];"
Philemon,1,24,"Marcus [a defense] , Aristarchus [the best ruler] , Demas [governor of the people] , Lucas [light-giving] , my fellowlabourers."
Philemon,1,25,"The grace of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] [be] with your Spirit [Ruach] . Amen. <[Written from Rome [strength] to Philemon, by Onesimus [profitable or useful] a slave.]>"
