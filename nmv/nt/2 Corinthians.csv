2 Corinthians,1,1,"Sha’ul [desired] , an apostle of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] by the will of God-The Father, and Timothy [honoring God] [our] brother, unto the church of God-The Father which is at Corinth [satiated] , with all the saints which are in all Achaia [trouble]:"
2 Corinthians,1,2,"Grace [be] to you and peace from God-The Father our Father, and [from] the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
2 Corinthians,1,3,"Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] God-The Father, even the Father of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , the Father of mercies, and the God-The Father of all comfort;"
2 Corinthians,1,4,"Who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort which we ourselves are comforted of God-The Father."
2 Corinthians,1,5,"For as the sufferings of Moshiach [Messiah] abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Moshiach [Messiah]."
2 Corinthians,1,6,"And whether we be afflicted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer (allow, to let, permit) : or whether we be comforted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation."
2 Corinthians,1,7,"And our hope of you [is] stedfast, knowing, that as you 2f are partakers of the sufferings, so [shall you 2f be] also of the consolation."
2 Corinthians,1,8,"For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia [orient] , that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:"
2 Corinthians,1,9,"But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God-The Father which raises the dead:"
2 Corinthians,1,10,"Who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver [us];"
2 Corinthians,1,11,"You 2f also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift [bestowed] upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf."
2 Corinthians,1,12,"For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly with incorruption, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God-The Father, we have had our Conversation (behavior; way of life; community) in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward (in custody, with a guard; prison)."
2 Corinthians,1,13,"For we write none other things unto you, than what you 2f read or acknowledge; and I trust you 2f shall acknowledge even to the end;"
2 Corinthians,1,14,"As also you 2f have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as you 2f also [are] ours in the day of the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
2 Corinthians,1,15,"And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that you 2f might have a second benefit;"
2 Corinthians,1,16,"And to pass by you into Macedonia [extended land] , and to come again out of Macedonia [extended land] unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Y’hudah [praised]."
2 Corinthians,1,17,"When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes yes, and No No?"
2 Corinthians,1,18,"But [as] God-The Father [is] true, our word toward you was not yes and No."
2 Corinthians,1,19,"For the Son of God-The Father, Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , who was preached among you by us, [even] by me and Silvanus (Silas) [woody] and Timothy [honoring God] , was not yes and No, but in him was yes."
2 Corinthians,1,20,"For all the promises of God-The Father in him [are] yes, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God-The Father by us."
2 Corinthians,1,21,"Now he which establishes us with you in Moshiach [Messiah] , and has anointed us, [is] God-The Father;"
2 Corinthians,1,22,"Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit [Ruach] in our hearts."
2 Corinthians,1,23,"Moreover I call God-The Father for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth [satiated]."
2 Corinthians,1,24,"Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith you 2f stand."
2 Corinthians,2,1,"But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness."
2 Corinthians,2,2,"For if I make you sorry, who is he then that makes me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?"
2 Corinthians,2,3,"And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is [the joy] of you all."
2 Corinthians,2,4,"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that you 2f should be grieved, but that you 2f might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you."
2 Corinthians,2,5,"But if any have caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all."
2 Corinthians,2,6,"Sufficient to such a man [is] this punishment, which [was inflicted] of many."
2 Corinthians,2,7,"So that contrariwise you 2f [ought] rather to forgive [him] , and comfort [him] , lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow."
2 Corinthians,2,8,For what reason I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you that you 2f would confirm [your] love toward him.
2 Corinthians,2,9,"For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you 2f be obedient in all things."
2 Corinthians,2,10,"To whom you 2f forgive any thing, I [forgive] also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave [it] , for your sakes [forgave I it] in the person of Moshiach [Messiah];"
2 Corinthians,2,11,Lest Satan [the adversary] should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
2 Corinthians,2,12,"Furthermore, when I came to Troas (Trojan) [penetrated] to [preach] Moshiach [Messiah] ’s Gospel (joyful message) , and a door was opened unto me of the Lord - Kurios,"
2 Corinthians,2,13,"I had no rest in my Spirit [Ruach] , because I found not Titus [nurse] my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia [extended land]."
2 Corinthians,2,14,"Now thanks [be] unto God-The Father, which always causes us to triumph in Moshiach [Messiah] , and makes manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place."
2 Corinthians,2,15,"For we are unto God-The Father a sweet savour of Moshiach [Messiah] , in them that are saved, and in them that perish:"
2 Corinthians,2,16,To the one [we are] the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who [is] sufficient for these things?
2 Corinthians,2,17,"For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God-The Father: but as of with incorruption, but as of God-The Father, in the sight of God-The Father speak we in Moshiach [Messiah]."
2 Corinthians,3,1,"Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some [others] , epistles of commendation to you, or [letters] of commendation from you?"
2 Corinthians,3,2,"You 2f are our Epistle (important or formal letter) written in our hearts, known and read of all men:"
2 Corinthians,3,3," [Forasmuch as you 2f are] manifestly declared to be the Epistle (important or formal letter) of Moshiach [Messiah] ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit [Ruach] of the living God-The Father; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart."
2 Corinthians,3,4,"And such trust have we through Moshiach [Messiah] to God-The Father-ward (in custody, with a guard; prison):"
2 Corinthians,3,5,Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency [is] of God-The Father;
2 Corinthians,3,6,"Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament (a covenant, ratified in death) ; not of the letter, but of the Spirit [Ruach] : for the letter kills, but the Spirit [Ruach] gives life."
2 Corinthians,3,7,"But if the ministration (service; ministry) of death, written [and] engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] could not stedfastly behold the face of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] for the glory of his Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor); which [glory] was to be done away:"
2 Corinthians,3,8,How shall not the ministration (service; ministry) of the Spirit [Ruach] be rather glorious?
2 Corinthians,3,9,"For if the ministration (service; ministry) of condemnation [be] glory, much more does the ministration (service; ministry) of righteousness exceed in glory."
2 Corinthians,3,10,"For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth."
2 Corinthians,3,11,"For if that which is done away [was] glorious, much more that which remains [is] glorious."
2 Corinthians,3,12,"Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:"
2 Corinthians,3,13,"And not as Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters], [which] put a vail over his face, that the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:"
2 Corinthians,3,14,"But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament (a covenant, ratified in death) ; which [vail] is done away in Moshiach [Messiah]."
2 Corinthians,3,15,"But even unto this day, when Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] is read, the vail is upon their heart."
2 Corinthians,3,16,"Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord - Kurios, the vail shall be taken away."
2 Corinthians,3,17,"Now the Lord - Kurios is that Spirit [Ruach] : and where the Spirit [Ruach] of the Lord - Kurios [is] , there [is] liberty."
2 Corinthians,3,18,"But we all, with open face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord - Kurios, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit [Ruach] of the Lord - Kurios."
2 Corinthians,4,1,"Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we give up not;"
2 Corinthians,4,2,"But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God-The Father deceitfully; but by manifestation of the tcommending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God-The Father."
2 Corinthians,4,3,"But if our Gospel (joyful message) be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:"
2 Corinthians,4,4,"In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel (joyful message) of Moshiach [Messiah] , who is the image of God-The Father, should shine unto them."
2 Corinthians,4,5,"For we preach not ourselves, but Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] the Lord - Kurios; and ourselves your servants for Yeshua [God is Salvation] ’ sake."
2 Corinthians,4,6,"For God-The Father, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to [give] the light of the knowledge of the glory of God-The Father in the face of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
2 Corinthians,4,7,"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God-The Father, and not of us."
2 Corinthians,4,8," [We are] troubled on every side, yet not distressed; [we are] perplexed, but not in despair;"
2 Corinthians,4,9,"Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;"
2 Corinthians,4,10,"Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , that the life also of Yeshua [God is Salvation] might be made manifest in our body."
2 Corinthians,4,11,"For we which live are always delivered unto death for Yeshua [God is Salvation] ’ sake, that the life also of Yeshua [God is Salvation] might be made manifest in our mortal flesh."
2 Corinthians,4,12,"So then death works in us, but life in you."
2 Corinthians,4,13,"We having the same Spirit [Ruach] of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;"
2 Corinthians,4,14,"Knowing that he which raised up the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] shall raise up us also by Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and shall present [us] with you."
2 Corinthians,4,15,"For all things [are] for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God-The Father."
2 Corinthians,4,16,"For which cause we give up not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward [man] is renewed day by day."
2 Corinthians,4,17,"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding [and] eternal weight of glory;"
2 Corinthians,4,18,"While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen [are] temporal; but the things which are not seen [are] eternal."
2 Corinthians,5,1,"For we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God-The Father, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
2 Corinthians,5,2,"For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:"
2 Corinthians,5,3,If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
2 Corinthians,5,4,"For we that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life."
2 Corinthians,5,5,"Now he that has wrought us for the selfsame thing [is] God-The Father, who also has given unto us the earnest of the Spirit [Ruach]."
2 Corinthians,5,6,"Therefore [we are] always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord - Kurios:"
2 Corinthians,5,7,"(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)"
2 Corinthians,5,8,"We are confident, [I say] , and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord - Kurios."
2 Corinthians,5,9,"For what reason we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him."
2 Corinthians,5,10,"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Moshiach [Messiah] ; that every one may receive the things [done] in [his] body, according to that he has done, whether [it be] good or bad."
2 Corinthians,5,11,"Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord - Kurios, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God-The Father; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences."
2 Corinthians,5,12,"For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you 2f may have somewhat to [answer] them which glory in appearance, and not in heart."
2 Corinthians,5,13,"For whether we be beside ourselves, [it is] to God-The Father: or whether we be sober, [it is] for your cause."
2 Corinthians,5,14,"For the love of Moshiach [Messiah] constrains us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:"
2 Corinthians,5,15,"And [that] he died for all, that they which live should not from this time forth (from now on) live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again."
2 Corinthians,5,16,"For what reason from this time forth (from now on) know we no man after the flesh: yes, though we have known Moshiach [Messiah] after the flesh, yet now from this time forth (from now on) know we [him] no more."
2 Corinthians,5,17,"Therefore if any man [be] in Moshiach [Messiah], [he is] a new creation: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."
2 Corinthians,5,18,"And all things [are] of God-The Father, who has reconciled us to himself by Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;"
2 Corinthians,5,19,"To wit, that God-The Father was in Moshiach [Messiah] , reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation."
2 Corinthians,5,20,"Now then we are ambassadors for Moshiach [Messiah] , as though God-The Father did beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) [you] by us: we pray [you] in Moshiach [Messiah] ’s stead, be you 2f reconciled to God-The Father."
2 Corinthians,5,21,"For he has made him [to be] sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God-The Father in him."
2 Corinthians,6,1,"We then, [as] workers together [with him] , beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) [you] also that you 2f receive not the grace of God-The Father in vain."
2 Corinthians,6,2,"(For he says, I have heard you i in a time accepted, and in a day of salvation have I succoured you i : behold, now [is] the accepted time; behold, now [is] the day of salvation.)"
2 Corinthians,6,3,"Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:"
2 Corinthians,6,4,"But in all [things] approving ourselves as the ministers of God-The Father, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,"
2 Corinthians,6,5,"In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;"
2 Corinthians,6,6,"By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] , by love unfeigned,"
2 Corinthians,6,7,"By the word of truth, by the power of God-The Father, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,"
2 Corinthians,6,8,"By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and [yet] true;"
2 Corinthians,6,9,"As unknown, and [yet] well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;"
2 Corinthians,6,10,"As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and [yet] possessing all things."
2 Corinthians,6,11,"O [you 2f ] Corinthians [satiated] , our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged."
2 Corinthians,6,12,"You 2f are not straitened (impeded or restricted; narrowed, distressed) in us, but you 2f are straitened (impeded or restricted; narrowed, distressed) in your own bowels (inward parts; affections)."
2 Corinthians,6,13,"Now for a recompence (punishment for evil, reward) in the same, (I speak as unto [my] children,) be you 2f also enlarged."
2 Corinthians,6,14,Be you 2f not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?
2 Corinthians,6,15,"And what concord (agreement; unison) has Moshiach [Messiah] with Belial [Worthless, Good for Nothing] ? or what part has he that believes with an unbeliever?"
2 Corinthians,6,16,"And what agreement has the temple of God-The Father with idols? for you 2f are the temple of the living God-The Father; as God-The Father has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in [them] ; and I will be their God-The Father, and they shall be my people."
2 Corinthians,6,17,"For what reason come out from among them, and be you 2f separate, says the Lord - Kurios, and touch not the unclean [thing] ; and I will receive you,"
2 Corinthians,6,18,"And will be a Father unto you, and you 2f shall be my sons and daughters, says the Lord - Kurios Almighty."
2 Corinthians,7,1,"Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and Spirit [Ruach] , perfecting holiness in the fear of God-The Father."
2 Corinthians,7,2,"Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man."
2 Corinthians,7,3,"I speak not [this] to condemn [you] : for I have said before, that you 2f are in our hearts to die and live with [you]."
2 Corinthians,7,4,"Great [is] my boldness of speech toward you, great [is] my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation."
2 Corinthians,7,5,"For, when we were come into Macedonia [extended land] , our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without [were] fightings, within [were] fears."
2 Corinthians,7,6,"Nevertheless God-The Father, that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus [nurse];"
2 Corinthians,7,7,"And not by his coming only, but by the consolation which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more."
2 Corinthians,7,8,"For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same Epistle (important or formal letter) has made you sorry, though [it were] but for a season."
2 Corinthians,7,9,"Now I rejoice, not that you 2f were made sorry, but that you 2f sorrowed to repentance: for you 2f were made sorry after a godly manner, that you 2f might receive damage by us in nothing."
2 Corinthians,7,10,For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world works death.
2 Corinthians,7,11,"For behold this selfsame thing, that you 2f sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yes, [what] clearing of yourselves, yes, [what] indignation, yes, [what] fear, yes, [what] vehement (violent; forceful; furious) desire, yes, [what] zeal, yes, [what] revenge! In all [things] you 2f have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter."
2 Corinthians,7,12,"For what reason, though I wrote unto you, [I did it] not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God-The Father might appear unto you."
2 Corinthians,7,13,"Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yes, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus [nurse] , because his Spirit [Ruach] was refreshed by you all."
2 Corinthians,7,14,"For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which [I made] before Titus [nurse] , is found a truth."
2 Corinthians,7,15,"And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you 2f received him."
2 Corinthians,7,16,I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all [things].
2 Corinthians,8,1,"Moreover, brethren, we do you that is to say of the grace of God-The Father bestowed on the churches of Macedonia [extended land];"
2 Corinthians,8,2,How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
2 Corinthians,8,3,"For to [their] power, I bear record, yes, and beyond [their] power [they were] willing of themselves;"
2 Corinthians,8,4,"Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and [take upon us] the fellowship of the ministering to the saints."
2 Corinthians,8,5,"And [this they did] , not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord - Kurios, and unto us by the will of God-The Father."
2 Corinthians,8,6,"Insomuch that we desired Titus [nurse] , that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also."
2 Corinthians,8,7,"Therefore, as you 2f abound in every [thing, in] faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all diligence, and [in] your love to us, [see] that you 2f abound in this grace also."
2 Corinthians,8,8,"I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness (being eager; zealous; ready; being inclined to do something) of others, and to prove the with incorruption of your love."
2 Corinthians,8,9,"For you 2f know the grace of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you 2f through his poverty might be rich."
2 Corinthians,8,10,"And herein I give [my] advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward (being eager; zealous; ready; being inclined to do something) a year ago."
2 Corinthians,8,11,"Now therefore finish the doing [of it] ; that as [there was] a readiness to will, so [there may be] a performance also out of that which you 2f have."
2 Corinthians,8,12,"For if there be first a willing mind, [it is] accepted according to that a man has, [and] not according to that he has not."
2 Corinthians,8,13,"For [I mean] not that other men be eased, and you 2f burdened:"
2 Corinthians,8,14,"But by an equality, [that] now at this time your abundance [may be a supply] for their want, that their abundance also may be [a supply] for your want: that there may be equality:"
2 Corinthians,8,15,"As it is written, He that [had gathered] much had nothing over; and he that [had gathered] little had no lack."
2 Corinthians,8,16,"But thanks [be] to God-The Father, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus [nurse] for you."
2 Corinthians,8,17,"For indeed he accepted the Exhortation (encouragement; counsel) ; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you."
2 Corinthians,8,18,"And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise [is] in the Gospel (joyful message) throughout all the churches;"
2 Corinthians,8,19,"And not [that] only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord - Kurios, and [declaration of] your ready mind:"
2 Corinthians,8,20,"Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:"
2 Corinthians,8,21,"Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord - Kurios, but also in the sight of men."
2 Corinthians,8,22,"And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which [I have] in you."
2 Corinthians,8,23,"Whether [any do enquire] of Titus [nurse], [he is] my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren [be enquired of, they are] the messengers of the churches, [and] the glory of Moshiach [Messiah]."
2 Corinthians,8,24,"For what reason show you 2f to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf."
2 Corinthians,9,1,"For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous (more than necessary or wanted) for me to write to you:"
2 Corinthians,9,2,"For I know the forwardness (being eager; zealous; ready; being inclined to do something) of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia [extended land] , that Achaia [trouble] was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many."
2 Corinthians,9,3,"Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, you 2f may be ready:"
2 Corinthians,9,4,"Lest perhaps (maybe) if they of Macedonia [extended land] come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, you 2f) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting."
2 Corinthians,9,5,"Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof you 2f had notice before, that the same might be ready, as [a matter of] bounty, and not as [of] covetousness."
2 Corinthians,9,6,"But this [I say] , He which sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which sows bountifully shall reap also bountifully."
2 Corinthians,9,7,"Every man according as he purposes in his heart, [so let him give] ; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God-The Father loves a cheerful giver."
2 Corinthians,9,8,"And God-The Father [is] able to make all grace abound toward you; that you 2f , always having all sufficiency in all [things] , may abound to every good work:"
2 Corinthians,9,9,"(As it is written, He has dispersed abroad; he has given to the poor: his righteousness remains forever."
2 Corinthians,9,10,"Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for [your] food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)"
2 Corinthians,9,11,"Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causes through us thanksgiving to God-The Father."
2 Corinthians,9,12,"For the administration of this service not only supplies the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God-The Father;"
2 Corinthians,9,13,"Whiles by the experiment of this ministration (service; ministry) they glorify God-The Father for your professed subjection unto the Gospel (joyful message) of Moshiach [Messiah] , and for [your] liberal distribution unto them, and unto all [men];"
2 Corinthians,9,14,"And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God-The Father in you."
2 Corinthians,9,15,Thanks [be] unto God-The Father for his unspeakable gift.
2 Corinthians,10,1,"Now I Sha’ul [desired] myself beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you by the meekness and gentleness of Moshiach [Messiah] , who in presence [am] base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:"
2 Corinthians,10,2,"But I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) [you] , that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, which I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh."
2 Corinthians,10,3,"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:"
2 Corinthians,10,4,"(For the weapons of our warfare [are] not carnal (of the flesh, sensual) , but mighty through God-The Father to the pulling down of strong holds;)"
2 Corinthians,10,5,"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God-The Father, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Moshiach [Messiah];"
2 Corinthians,10,6,"And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled."
2 Corinthians,10,7,"Do you 2f look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Moshiach [Messiah] ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he [is] Moshiach [Messiah] ’s, even so [are] we Moshiach [Messiah] ’s."
2 Corinthians,10,8,"For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord - Kurios has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:"
2 Corinthians,10,9,That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
2 Corinthians,10,10,"For [his] letters, say they, [are] weighty and powerful; but [his] bodily presence [is] weak, and [his] speech contemptible."
2 Corinthians,10,11,"Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such [will we be] also in deed when we are present."
2 Corinthians,10,12,"For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise."
2 Corinthians,10,13,"But we will not boast of things without [our] measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God-The Father has distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you."
2 Corinthians,10,14,"For we stretch not ourselves beyond [our measure] , as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in [preaching] the Gospel (joyful message) of Moshiach [Messiah]:"
2 Corinthians,10,15,"Not boasting of things without [our] measure, [that is] , of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,"
2 Corinthians,10,16,"To preach the Gospel (joyful message) in the [regions] beyond you, [and] not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand."
2 Corinthians,10,17,"But he that glories, let him glory in the Lord - Kurios."
2 Corinthians,10,18,"For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord - Kurios commendeth."
2 Corinthians,11,1,Would to God-The Father you 2f could bear with me a little in [my] folly: and indeed bear with me.
2 Corinthians,11,2,"For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present [you as] a pure (clean; not corrupt) virgin to Moshiach [Messiah]."
2 Corinthians,11,3,"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Khav’vah [Eve] (to breath, to live) through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Moshiach [Messiah]."
2 Corinthians,11,4,"For if he that comes preaches another Yeshua [God is Salvation] , whom we have not preached, or [if] you 2f receive another Spirit [Ruach] , which you 2f have not received, or another Gospel (joyful message) , which you 2f have not accepted, you 2f might well bear with [him]."
2 Corinthians,11,5,For I suppose I was not the least bit behind the very most important apostles.
2 Corinthians,11,6,"But though [I be] rude (unskilled, unrefined or unlearned) in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things."
2 Corinthians,11,7,"Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that you 2f might be exalted, because I have preached to you the Gospel (joyful message) of God-The Father freely?"
2 Corinthians,11,8,"I robbed other churches, taking wages [of them] , to do you service."
2 Corinthians,11,9,"And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia [extended land] supplied: and in all [things] I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and [so] will I keep [myself]."
2 Corinthians,11,10,"As the tof Moshiach [Messiah] is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia [trouble]."
2 Corinthians,11,11,For what reason? because I love you not? God-The Father knows.
2 Corinthians,11,12,"But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we."
2 Corinthians,11,13,"For such [are] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Moshiach [Messiah]."
2 Corinthians,11,14,And no marvel; for Satan [the adversary] himself is transformed into an angel of light.
2 Corinthians,11,15,Therefore [it is] no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
2 Corinthians,11,16,"I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little."
2 Corinthians,11,17,"That which I speak, I speak [it] not after the Lord - Kurios, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting."
2 Corinthians,11,18,"Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also."
2 Corinthians,11,19,"For you 2f suffer (allow, to let, permit) fools gladly, seeing you 2f [yourselves] are wise."
2 Corinthians,11,20,"For you 2f suffer (allow, to let, permit) , if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour [you] , if a man take [of you] , if a man exalt himself, if a man strike you on the face."
2 Corinthians,11,21,"I speak as concerning reproach (disgrace; shame) , as though we had been weak. However whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also."
2 Corinthians,11,22,Are they ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] ? so [am] I. Are they Yisra’eli’s? so [am] I. Are they the seed of Avraham [Exalted Father] ? so [am] I.
2 Corinthians,11,23,"Are they ministers of Moshiach [Messiah]? (I speak as a fool) I [am] more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft."
2 Corinthians,11,24,Of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] five times received I forty [stripes] save one.
2 Corinthians,11,25,"Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;"
2 Corinthians,11,26," [In] journeyings often, [in] perils of waters, [in] perils of robbers, [in] perils by [my own] countrymen, [in] perils by the heathen, [in] perils in the city, [in] perils in the wilderness, [in] perils in the sea, [in] perils among false brethren;"
2 Corinthians,11,27,"In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness."
2 Corinthians,11,28,"Beside those things that are without, that which comes upon me daily, the care of all the churches."
2 Corinthians,11,29,"Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?"
2 Corinthians,11,30,"If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities."
2 Corinthians,11,31,"The God-The Father and Father of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , which is Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) forevermore, knows that I lie not."
2 Corinthians,11,32,"In Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] the governor under Aretas [graver] the king kept the city of the Damascenes (Damascus) with a Garrison (fortification; military post) , desirous to apprehend me:"
2 Corinthians,11,33,"And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands."
2 Corinthians,12,1,It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord - Kurios.
2 Corinthians,12,2,"I knew a man in Moshiach [Messiah] above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God-The Father knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven."
2 Corinthians,12,3,"And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God-The Father knows;)"
2 Corinthians,12,4,"How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter."
2 Corinthians,12,5,"Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in my infirmities."
2 Corinthians,12,6,"For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but [now] I refrain (restrain; refrein from acting) , lest any man should think of me above that which he sees me [to be] , or [that] he hears of me."
2 Corinthians,12,7,"And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan [the adversary] to buffet (to strike with a clenched fist) me, lest I should be exalted above measure."
2 Corinthians,12,8,"For this thing I besought the Lord - Kurios thrice, that it might depart from me."
2 Corinthians,12,9,"And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for you i : for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Moshiach [Messiah] may rest upon me."
2 Corinthians,12,10,"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Moshiach [Messiah] ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong."
2 Corinthians,12,11,"I am become a fool in glorying; you 2f have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very most important apostles, though I be nothing."
2 Corinthians,12,12,"Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds."
2 Corinthians,12,13,"For what is it wherein you 2f were inferior to other churches, except [it be] that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong."
2 Corinthians,12,14,"Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children."
2 Corinthians,12,15,"And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved."
2 Corinthians,12,16,"But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with deceit."
2 Corinthians,12,17,Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
2 Corinthians,12,18,"I desired Titus [nurse] , and with [him] I sent a brother. Did Titus [nurse] make a gain of you? walked we not in the same Spirit [Ruach]? [walked we] not in the same steps?"
2 Corinthians,12,19,"Again, think you 2f that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God-The Father in Moshiach [Messiah] : but [we do] all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying."
2 Corinthians,12,20,"For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and [that] I shall be found unto you such as you 2f would not: lest [there be] debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:"
2 Corinthians,12,21," [And] lest, when I come again, my God-The Father will humble me among you, and [that] I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness (being lustful, loose or lewd; promoting lustful desires in others) which they have committed."
2 Corinthians,13,1,This [is] the third [time] I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
2 Corinthians,13,2,"I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:"
2 Corinthians,13,3,"Since you 2f seek a proof of Moshiach [Messiah] speaking in me, which to you-ward (in custody, with a guard; prison) is not weak, but is mighty in you."
2 Corinthians,13,4,"For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God-The Father. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God-The Father toward you."
2 Corinthians,13,5,"Examine yourselves, whether you 2f be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know you 2f not your own selves, how that Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] is in you, except you 2f be reprobates?"
2 Corinthians,13,6,But I trust that you 2f shall know that we are not reprobates.
2 Corinthians,13,7,"Now I pray to God-The Father that you 2f do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that you 2f should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates."
2 Corinthians,13,8,"For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth."
2 Corinthians,13,9,"For we are glad, when we are weak, and you 2f are strong: and this also we wish, [even] your perfection."
2 Corinthians,13,10,"Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord - Kurios has given me to edification, and not to destruction."
2 Corinthians,13,11,"Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God-The Father of love and peace shall be with you."
2 Corinthians,13,12,Greet one another with an holy kiss.
2 Corinthians,13,13,All the saints salute you.
2 Corinthians,13,14,"The grace of the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , and the love of God-The Father, and the communion of the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh], [be] with you all. Amen. <The second [Epistle (important or formal letter)] to the Corinthians [satiated] was written from Philippi [lover of horses], [a city] of Macedonia [extended land] , by Titus [nurse] and Lucas [light-giving] .>"
