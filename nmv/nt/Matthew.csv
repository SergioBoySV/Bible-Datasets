Matthew,1,12,Y’khanyahu [Yah estabished] begot Sh’altiel [I asked God (El)] ; Sh’altiel [I asked God (El)] begot Z’rubavel [begotten in Babylon (confusion)].

Matthew,1,17,"So all the generations from Avraham [Exalted Father] unto David [Beloved] were fourteen generations and from David [Beloved] unto the exile in Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) were fourteen generations and from the exile in Bavel (to jumble, or a confused medley of sounds; confusion; gate of the deity) unto Yeshua [God is Salvation] were fourteen generations."
Matthew,1,18,"The birth of Yeshua [God is Salvation] was in this way: It came to pass when his mother was betrothed to Yosef [he will add] , before he had intercourse with her, she was found with Child by Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit [Ruach]) (which means: The Holy Spirit [Ruach])."
Matthew,1,19,Yosef [he will add] was a righteous man and did not wish to dwell with her nor to expose her by bringing her to shame or to bind her over to death. He instead wished to conceal her.
Matthew,1,20,"While he thought on this matter in his heart, behold an angel appeared to him in a dream and said: “Yosef [he will add] ben David [Beloved] do not fear to take Miryam [waters of strength] as your wife because she is with Child by Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit [Ruach]) ”."
Matthew,1,21,“She will bear a son and you will call his name Yeshua [God is Salvation] because he will save My people from their sins”.
Matthew,1,22,"Then Yosef [he will add] awoke from his sleep, did according to all which the angel of Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] commanded him, and took her as his wife."
Matthew,1,23,But he did not have intercourse with her until she brought forth her firstborn Son and he called his name Yeshua [God is Salvation].
Matthew,2,1,"It came to pass when Yeshua [God is Salvation] was born in Beit-Lechem [house of bread] of Y’hudah [Praise] in the days of Herod [heroic] the king, behold Astronomers came from the East to Yerushalayim [abode of peace]"
Matthew,2,2,saying: ‘Where is the King of the Yehudim [praise] who has been born? We have seen his star in the East and have come with important gifts to do homage to him’.
Matthew,2,3,Herod [heroic] the king heard and was dismayed and all the inhabitants of Yerushalayim [abode of peace] with him.
Matthew,2,4,So he gathered all the chief priests and Torah-teachers (Scribes) of the people and inquired from them if they knew where Ha-Moshiach [Messiah] [The Messiah] would be born.
Matthew,2,5,"They answered him: ‘In Beit-Lechem [house of bread] Y’hudah [Praise] , as it is written by the Prophet according to Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] ’:"
Matthew,2,6,"“You Beit-Lechem [house of bread] Efratah, behold you are insignificant among the tribes of Y’hudah [Praise] ; from you shall come forth to Me one to be Ruler in Y’sra’el [he who holds onto the heal of God] ”."
Matthew,2,7,Then King Herod [heroic] called the Astronomers in secret and asked them thoroughly concerning the time the star appeared to them.
Matthew,2,8,He sent them to Beit-Lechem [house of bread] and said unto them: ‘Go and enquire thoroughly concerning the child and when you find him inform me. I also will go to him to do homage’.
Matthew,2,9,They listened unto the king and departed and behold the star which they saw in the East was going before them until they came to the place. When they entered Beit-Lechem [house of bread] it stopped over the place where the Child was.
Matthew,2,10,When they saw the star they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
Matthew,2,11,"They came into the house, found the Boy and his mother Miryam [waters of strength] , knelt before him, did homage to him, opened their sacks and presented to him gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh."
Matthew,2,12,Then they were commanded in a dream by the angel who spoke to them not to return to Herod [heroic] ; so they returned to their land by another route.
Matthew,2,13,"As they were going, behold an angel of Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] appeared unto Yosef [he will add] saying: “Arise take the Boy and his mother, flee to Mitzrayim (Egypt) [the black land] and stay there until I tell you, because Herod [heroic] will seek the Boy to kill him”."
Matthew,2,14,"So he took the Boy and his mother by night and departed for Mitzrayim (Egypt) [the black land],"
Matthew,2,15,"and was there until Herod [heroic] died, to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet “Out of Mitzrayim (Egypt) [the black land] I called My Son”."
Matthew,2,16,"Then Herod [heroic] saw that the Astronomers had outwitted him and was very displeased. Being grieved at heart, he commanded that word be sent to all his princes to kill all the male children who were in Beit-Lechem [house of bread] and its borders who had been born from the time when the star appeared, which he had determined when the Astronomers spoke to him concerning the birth of the Boy."
Matthew,2,17,Then was fulfilled that which Yirmeyahu [Our God has uplifted] the prophet spoke:
Matthew,2,18,"“A voice is heard in Ramah [high] , lamentation and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and she refused to be comforted for her children because they are no more”."
Matthew,2,19,It came to pass when King Herod [heroic] died; the angel of Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] appeared in a dream to Yosef [he will add] in Mitzrayim (Egypt) [the black land]
Matthew,2,20,"saying: “Arise, take the Boy and his mother and go to the land of Y’sra’el [he who holds onto the heal of God] , because those who were seeking to kill him are dead”."
Matthew,2,21,"So he arose, took the Boy and his mother, and they returned to the land of Y’sra’el [he who holds onto the heal of God]."
Matthew,2,22,"Then he heard that Archelaus [ruler of the people] reigned in Y’hudah [Praise] in the place of Herod [heroic] his father, and he was afraid to go there. So the angel urged him in a dream that he should turn aside into the land of Galil [circuit]."
Matthew,2,23,He came and dwelt in a city called Natzeret in order to fulfill what the prophets said: “He shall be called ‘despised’”.
Matthew,3,1,In those days came Yochanan [Yah is gracious] the Baptizer preaching in the wilderness of Y’hudah [Praise].
Matthew,3,2,"He said: “Turn in repentance, for the Kingdom of heaven is near”."
Matthew,3,3,"To fulfill what was written by Yesha’yahu [the salvation of our God] the prophet: “Listen! a voice of one calling: ‘Prepare ye in the wilderness the Way of Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] , make plain in the desert a Highway for our Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] ’”."
Matthew,3,4,Behold Yochanan [Yah is gracious] was clothed with the hair of camels and black leather girded his loins (thigh and groin area; often used for the reproductive organs) and his food was locust and the honey of the forest.
Matthew,3,5,"Then they came out to him from Yerushalayim [abode of peace] , from all Y’hudah [Praise] , and from all the kingdom round about the Yarden [descender],"
Matthew,3,6,and at that time were confessing their sins and were baptized by Yochanan [Yah is gracious] in the Yarden [descender] because of his word.
Matthew,3,7,"He saw that many of the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] and the Tz’dukim (Sadducees) [followers of the right] came to his baptism and he said to them: “Offspring of serpents, who taught you to flee from the wrath to come from The Mighty One”?."
Matthew,3,8,“Produce the fruit of perfect repentance”.
Matthew,3,9,“Do not say in your heart: ‘Avraham [Exalted Father] is our father’. Truly I say to you that Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] is able to raise up children to Avraham [Exalted Father] from these stones”.
Matthew,3,10,"“Already the axe has reached the root of the tree; the one which does not produce good fruit will be cut down and burned in the fire”. The crowds asked him: ‘If so what shall we do’? Yochanan [Yah is gracious] answered them: “He who has two shirts let him give one to him who has none”. So the people came to be baptized. Many asked him ‘What shall we do’? And he answered them: “Be anxious for no man and do not chastise them, and be pleased with your lot”. And all the people were thinking and reckoning in their circumcised heart: ‘Yochanan [Yah is gracious] is Ha-Moshiach [Messiah] [The Messiah] ’."
Matthew,3,11,"Yochanan [Yah is gracious] answered all of them “Behold I truly baptize you with water in the days of repentance, but another comes mightier than I, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unfasten. He will baptize you with the fire of Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit [Ruach] )”."
Matthew,3,12,"“His winnowing fork is in his hand to fan (a fork-shaped tool to throw grain in the air, to let he wind separate the wheat from the chaff) his threshing floor and he will gather the grain into his granary and the straw he will burn with fire which is not quenched”."
Matthew,3,13,Then came Yeshua [God is Salvation] from Galil [circuit] to the Yarden [descender] to be baptized by Yochanan [Yah is gracious].
Matthew,3,14,"But Yochanan [Yah is gracious] was doubtful about baptizing him and said to him “I should be baptized by you, and you come to me?”"
Matthew,3,15,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said to him: “Permit it, because we are obliged to fulfill all righteousness”; then Yochanan [Yah is gracious] baptized him."
Matthew,3,16,"Immediately when he came up from the water, the heavens were opened to him and he saw The Ruach [Spirit [Ruach]] (Spirit [Ruach]) of Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] coming down in the likeness of a dove and remained upon him."
Matthew,3,17,"Then behold a voice from heaven was saying: “This is My beloved Son, whom I love very very much and in whom I am very well pleased”."
Matthew,4,1,Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] was taken by Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit [Ruach]) into the wilderness to be tried or tested by Satan [the adversary].
Matthew,4,2,He fasted forty days and forty nights and afterwards was hungry.
Matthew,4,3,The tempter drew near and said to him: ‘If you are the Son of Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] say that these stones should turn into bread’.
Matthew,4,4,Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said to him: It is written: “Man does not live by bread alone but man lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] ”
Matthew,4,5,"Then Satan [the adversary] took him to the holy city, placed him on the highest point in all the temple"
Matthew,4,6,"and said to him: ‘If you are the Son of Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] , jump down, for it is written’ “He will give His angels charge over you to guard you in all your ways. They will bear you up in their hands lest you dash your foot against a stone.”"
Matthew,4,7,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered him, again it is written: “You shall not test Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] your Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] ”."
Matthew,4,8,"So Satan [the adversary] took him to an exceedingly high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the earth and their glory"
Matthew,4,9,and said to him: ‘All these things I will give you if you bare your head to me’.
Matthew,4,10,"Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered him: Go Satan [the adversary] , for it is written: “I will pray to Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] and Him only will you serve”."
Matthew,4,11,Then Satan [the adversary] left him and behold angels drew near to him and ministered to him.
Matthew,4,12,"It came to pass in those days Yeshua [God is Salvation] heard that Yochanan [Yah is gracious] had been delivered up into prison, so he went into Galil [circuit]."
Matthew,4,13,He passed by Natzeret [separated] and dwelt in K’far-Nachum [town of comfort] on the outskirts of the land of Z’vulun [exaltation]
Matthew,4,14,in order to fulfill that which Yesha’yahu [the salvation of our God] the Prophet said:
Matthew,4,15,"“Land of Z’vulun [exaltation] and land of Naftali [wrestling] , the way of the Sea, beyond the Yarden [descender] , Galil [circuit] of the Goyim (Goyim [Gentiles]) ”."
Matthew,4,16,"“The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined”."
Matthew,4,17,From then on Yeshua [God is Salvation] began to preach and to say: “Turn you in repentance for the Kingdom of heaven is here”.
Matthew,4,18,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] went along the shore of the sea of Galil [circuit] and saw two brothers, Shim’on [he has heard] , also called Kefa [pebble] , and Andrew [of a man] his brother casting their nets into the sea because they were fishermen."
Matthew,4,19,"He said to them: “Come, follow me and I will make you fish for men”."
Matthew,4,20,So they left their nets in that hour and followed him.
Matthew,4,21,He turned from there and saw two other brothers; Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] and Yochanan [Yah is gracious] ; brothers who were sons of Zavdai [Yah has bestowed] ; and their father in a boat setting up their nets and he called them.
Matthew,4,22,They made haste and left their nets and their father and followed after him.
Matthew,4,23,Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] went around the land of Galil [circuit] teaching their assemblies and preaching to them the good gift of the Kingdom of heaven and healing all the sick and every disease among the people.
Matthew,4,24,"So a report about him went into all the land Syria [etymology is uncertain] and they brought unto him all those who were sick from various kinds of diseases, those possessed by demons, those who were terrified by an evil Spirit [Ruach] and those who shook, and he healed them."
Matthew,4,25,"Many followed him from Decapolis [The 10-Towns] and Galil [circuit] , from Yerushalayim [abode of peace] , Y’hudah [praised] and across the Yarden [descender]."
Matthew,5,1,It came to pass after this; when he saw the crowds; that he went up on the mountain and sat down. Then his disciples came to him
Matthew,5,2,and he opened his mouth and spoke to them saying:
Matthew,5,3,"“Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) are the humble in Spirit [Ruach] , for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven”."
Matthew,5,4,"“Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted”."
Matthew,5,5,"“Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth”."
Matthew,5,6,"“Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied”."
Matthew,5,7,"“Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy”."
Matthew,5,8,"“Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) are the pure of heart, for they shall see Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] ”."
Matthew,5,9,"“Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) are those who pursue peace, for they shall be called sons of Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] ”."
Matthew,5,10,"“Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven”."
Matthew,5,11,"“Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) are you when they persecute and revile you and say all kinds of evil against you for my sake, but speak falsely”."
Matthew,5,12,"“Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is very great in heaven; for thus they persecuted the prophets who were before you”."
Matthew,5,13,At that time Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “You are salt in the world. If the salt is neutralized in regard to its taste with what will it be salted? It is fit for nothing but to be cast outside to be trampled underfoot”.
Matthew,5,14,“You are light in the world. A city built upon a hill cannot be hidden”.
Matthew,5,15,“They do not light a lamp to place it in a hidden place where it cannot shine; but they place it upon a lamp-stand so that it might shine for all in the house”.
Matthew,5,16,“Thus let your light shine before every man to show them your good deeds which give praise and glory to your Father Who is in heaven”.
Matthew,5,17,"At that time Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “Do not think that I am come to annul the Torah or the Prophets, but to fulfill”."
Matthew,5,18,"“Truly I say to you that until heaven and earth depart, one letter or one nikkudot (which means: ‘vowel point’) shall not be abolished from the Torah or the Prophets, because all will be fulfilled”."
Matthew,5,19,"“He who shall transgress one word of these commandments and shall teach others shall be called ‘a vain person’, in the Kingdom of heaven; but whoever upholds and teaches them shall be called ‘great’, in the Kingdom of heaven”."
Matthew,5,20,"At that time Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “Truly I say to you: if your righteousness is not greater than the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] and the Torah-teachers (Scribes) , you shall not enter into the Kingdom of heaven”."
Matthew,5,21,“Have you not heard what was said to those of old: ‘You shall not murder and whoever murders is guilty of a judgment of death’”?
Matthew,5,22,"“But I say to you, he who angers his companion is guilty of judgment; he who calls his brother inferior shall be guilty of judgment before the congregation; he who calls him a fool is guilty of the fire of Gei-Hinnom [hell, valley of evil counsel] ”."
Matthew,5,23,"“If you should offer your gift at the altar and remember that you have a quarrel with your companion and he is complaining about you because of this matter”,"
Matthew,5,24,“leave your gift there before the altar and go to appease him first and afterwards offer your gift”.
Matthew,5,25,Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “See that you hasten to appease your enemy while you are walking with him in the way lest he deliver you to the judge and this judge delivers you to the slave to put you into prison”.
Matthew,5,26,"“Truly I say to you, you will not come out from there until the last piece of money is given”."
Matthew,5,27,Again he said to them: “You have heard what was said to those of long ago: You shall not commit adultery”.
Matthew,5,28,“But I say to you that everyone who sees a woman and covets her has already committed adultery with her in his heart”.
Matthew,5,29,"“If you right eye seduces you, pluck it out and cast it from you”."
Matthew,5,30,"“Also, if your hand seduces you, cut it off. It is better for you to suffer (allow, to let, permit) the loss of one of your limbs than all your body in Gei-Hinnom [hell, valley of evil counsel] ”."
Matthew,5,31,"Again Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “You have heard what was said to those of long ago that everyone who leaves his wife and divorces her is to give her a bill of divorce”,"
Matthew,5,32,“And I say to you that everyone who leaves his wife is to give her a bill of divorce. But concerning adultery. he is the one who commits adultery and he who takes her commits adultery”.
Matthew,5,33,"“Again you have heard what was said to those of long ago: You shall not swear by My Name falsely, but you shall return to Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] your oath”."
Matthew,5,34,"“But I say to you not to swear uselessly in any matter, neither by Heaven because it is the throne of The Mighty One”,"
Matthew,5,35,"“nor by Earth because it is the footstool of His feet, nor by Yerushalayim [abode of peace] because it is the city of The Mighty One”."
Matthew,5,36,“nor by your head for you are not able to make one hair white or black”.
Matthew,5,37,“But let your words be ‘yes yes’ or ‘no no’. Everything in addition to this is evil”.
Matthew,5,38,"“Again you have heard what is said in the Torah: An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”."
Matthew,5,39,"“But I say to you, do not repay evil for evil; but he who smites your right cheek provide for him the left”."
Matthew,5,40,"“He who wishes to oppose you in judgment and to rob your shirt, leave to him your garment”."
Matthew,5,41,"“He who asks you to go with him a thousand steps, go with him two thousand”."
Matthew,5,42,“To him who asks from you give and from him who wishes to borrow from you do not hold back”.
Matthew,5,43,Again Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “You have heard what was said to those of long ago that you shall love the one who loves you and hate the one who hates you”.
Matthew,5,44,"“But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to the one who hates you and vexes you and pray for those who persecute you and oppress you”,"
Matthew,5,45,“in order that you might be sons of your Father Who is in heaven Who causes His sun to shine on the good and evil and causes it to rain on the just and the unjust”.
Matthew,5,46,“If you love those who love you what is your reward? Do not the Goyim [Gentiles] love those who love them?”
Matthew,5,47,"“And if you greet your friends only, what do you do more than others? Do not the Goyim [Gentiles] do the same?”"
Matthew,5,48,“Be you perfect as your Father Who is in heaven is perfect”.
Matthew,6,1,"“Beware lest you do your charitable deeds before men that they might praise you; if you do, you will have no reward from your Father Who is in heaven”."
Matthew,6,2,"Again Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to them: “When you do charitable deeds do not wish to make a proclamation or blow trumpets before you as the hypocrites, who do their charitable deeds in the market places and in the streets in order that men might see them. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward already”."
Matthew,6,3,"“But when you do charitable deeds, let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing”,"
Matthew,6,4,“in order that your gift might be in secret and your Father Who sees hidden things will reward you”.
Matthew,6,5,"At that time Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “When you pray do not raise your voice and do not be like the sad hypocrites who love to pray in the synagogues and in the corner of the courtyards and pray with arrogant (proud; lifted up) speech that men might hear and praise them. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward already”."
Matthew,6,6,"“But when you pray, go to your bedroom, close your doors upon you, and pray to your Father in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you”."
Matthew,6,7,"“So when you pray, do not multiply words as the heretics who think that by their multitude of words they will make themselves heard”"
Matthew,6,8,“Do not be like them. Your Father Who is in heaven knows your words before you ask from Him?”
Matthew,6,9,"“But thus you shall pray: Our Father, Who art (you - one person - are) in heaven, may Your Name be acknowledged as Holy;”"
Matthew,6,10,“may Your Kingdom be Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) ; may Your will be done in heaven and on earth”.
Matthew,6,11,“Give us our bread continually”.
Matthew,6,12,"“Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us,"
Matthew,6,13,“and do not allow us into the power of temptation but keep us from all evil. Amen”.
Matthew,6,14,“If you forgive men their sins your Father Who is in heaven will forgive your sins”
Matthew,6,15,“But if you do not forgive them He will not forgive you your sins”
Matthew,6,16,"Again he said to them: “When you fast do not be as the sad hypocrites who make themselves appear sad and who change their faces, to show their fasting before men; truly I say to you, they have already received their reward”."
Matthew,6,17,"“But when you fast, wash your heads”."
Matthew,6,18,"“that you might not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father Who is in secret, and your Father Who is in secret will reward you”."
Matthew,6,19,Again he said to them: “Do not keep on heaping up treasures on earth so that decay and grub devour it or thieves dig through and steal them”
Matthew,6,20,“Make for yourselves treasures in heaven where the worm and the grub do not devour them and where thieves do not dig through and steal”.
Matthew,6,21,“In the place where your treasure is there will be your heart”.
Matthew,6,22,“The lamp of your body is your eyes. If your eyes look straight ahead your body shall not be dark”.
Matthew,6,23,"“If your eyes grow dim your whole body will become dark; and if the light which is in you becomes dark, all your ways will be dark”."
Matthew,6,24,"At that time Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “No one is able to serve two masters except he who hates the one and loves the other, or he honors the one and despises the other; you cannot serve The Mighty One and the world”."
Matthew,6,25,"“Therefore I say to you: “Do not be anxious for the food for your souls nor for the clothing for your body, because the soul is more precious than food and the body than clothing.”"
Matthew,6,26,"“Behold the birds of the sky which sow not nor reap nor gather into barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not more precious than they?”"
Matthew,6,27,"“Who among you, of those who are anxious, is able to add to his height one cubit?”"
Matthew,6,28,"“If this is the case, why are you anxious for clothes? Behold the lilies of Sharon in growing they neither spin nor weave”."
Matthew,6,29,"“But I say to you that King Solomon, in all his glory, was not clothed like these”."
Matthew,6,30,"“If The Mighty One clothes the straw which is left in the standing grain, which is fresh today and tomorrow is dried up and is placed into the oven, so much the more will He clothe you who are little of faith”"
Matthew,6,31,"“If the Mighty One so thinks of you, do not be anxious saying what shall we eat and what shall we drink?”"
Matthew,6,32,“because all these things the bodies seek. But your Father Who is in heaven knows that you need all these things”.

Matthew,7,12,"“Everything you wish that men should do to you, do to them; this is the Torah and the words of the prophets”."
Matthew,7,13,"At that time Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “Enter in the narrow gate because the gate of destruction is wide and deep, and many are going through it”"
Matthew,7,14,“How narrow is the gate and marked by grief the Way that leads straight to life and few are those who find it”

Matthew,7,29,"because he was preaching to them with great power, not as the rest of the Torah-teachers (Scribes) and P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] ”"
Matthew,8,1,It came to pass when Yeshua [God is Salvation] came down from the mountain that a great crowd followed him.
Matthew,8,2,"Then behold a leper came and did homage to him saying: ‘Adon [Lord - Kurios of the Earth] , is it your wish to heal me’?"
Matthew,8,3,Yeshua [God is Salvation] stretched forth his hand and touched him saying: “I wish that you be cleansed” and in that hour the leper was cleansed from his leprosy.
Matthew,8,4,"Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to him: “Be careful lest you tell any man, but go to the priest to offer your gifts as Moshe [drawn out] commanded in your law”."
Matthew,8,5,"It came to pass when he entered K’far-Nachum [town of comfort] that a captain of hundreds came to him and implored him,"
Matthew,8,6,"saying: ‘Adon [Lord - Kurios of the Earth] , my son lies in my house with the sickness of contraction and he is weak with the illness’."
Matthew,8,7,Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to him: “I will go and heal him”
Matthew,8,8,The captain of hundreds answered and said to him: ‘Adon [Lord - Kurios of the Earth] I am not worthy that you should come under my roof; only make the decision that he might be healed’.
Matthew,8,9,"‘I am a sinful man and I have authority under the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] and I have horses and riders and I say to one of them go and he goes, come and he comes, and to my servants do this and they do it’."
Matthew,8,10,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] heard and was amazed and said to those who were following him: “Truly I say to you, I have not found a great faith, in Y’sra’el [he who holds onto the heal of God] , like this”."
Matthew,8,11,"“I say to you that many will come from the East and from the West and will rest with Avraham [Exalted Father] , Yitz’chak [Laughter] and Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] in the Kingdom of heaven”:"
Matthew,8,12,"“but the sons of the Kingdom will be cast into the darkness of Gei-Hinnom [hell, valley of evil counsel] ; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth”."
Matthew,8,13,Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to the captain of hundreds: “Go; as you have believed; it will be done to you”. So the little child was healed at that time.
Matthew,8,14,"At that time, Yeshua [God is Salvation] went into the house of Kefa [pebble] and behold his mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever."
Matthew,8,15,"He touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she arose and ministered to him."
Matthew,8,16,"At the time of evening they brought to him those seized by demons and he healed them by his word alone and he healed every sickness,"
Matthew,8,17,"to fulfill what was said by Yesha’yahu [the salvation of our God] the prophet, of Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) memory: “Surely our diseases he bore and our pains he carried”"
Matthew,8,18,It came to pass after this Yeshua [God is Salvation] saw many crowds around him and he commanded his disciples to go across the sea.
Matthew,8,19,Then a scribe came to him and said to him: ‘Teacher I will follow you wherever you go’
Matthew,8,20,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered him: “The foxes have holes and the birds have nests, but the Son of Man, the Son of the virgin, has no place to enter his head”."
Matthew,8,21,One of his disciples said to him: ‘Allow me to go and bury my father’
Matthew,8,22,Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to him: “Follow me and let the dead bury their dead”.
Matthew,8,23,"It came to pass when Yeshua [God is Salvation] entered a boat, his disciples followed him."
Matthew,8,24,"A great storm came on the sea, and the waves were coming on excessively, and the boat was thought to be breaking up."
Matthew,8,25,His disciples came to him and begged him saying: ‘O our Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] save us lest we perish’.
Matthew,8,26,"He said to them: “Why do you look at one another, O you of little faith?”. He arose and commanded the sea and the winds that they should be quiet and immediately they became quiet."
Matthew,8,27,"When the men who were there saw, they marveled and said: ‘Who is this that the winds and the sea do his will’?"
Matthew,8,28,"It came to pass when he crossed over the sea and passed by the region beyond the sea into the realm of Gaderi [those who come from pilgrimage or fight] , there met him two demon-possessed men coming out of the tombs, raging, so that no man could pass by that way."
Matthew,8,29,"They cried out to him saying: ‘What is between you and us, Yeshua [God is Salvation] Son of Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] ?. Have you come before the time to grieve us and to destroy us? Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to them: “Come out from there, evil host”"
Matthew,8,30,"There, near them, were herds of many swine, feeding."
Matthew,8,31,"So the demons entreated him: ‘Since we have to go out from here, grant us authority to go into these swine."
Matthew,8,32,"He said to them: “Go”. The demons went out from the men and entered the swine, and all the herd went in sudden haste, slipped off into the sea and died in the water."
Matthew,8,33,"Those who were feeding [the swine] feared, fled, and told everything in the city. So the whole city was frightened."
Matthew,8,34,They went out to meet Yeshua [God is Salvation] . They saw [the swine] and entreated him not to come across their border.
Matthew,9,1,Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] entered a boat; they set sail and returned to his city.
Matthew,9,2,"They brought to him one who was sick with contractions, lying upon his bed. Yeshua [God is Salvation] saw their faith and said to the sick man: “Have courage my son. It is by the faith of The Mighty One that your sins have been forgiven”."
Matthew,9,3,Some of the Torah-teachers (Scribes) were saying in their heart: ‘This one blasphemes’.
Matthew,9,4,Yeshua [God is Salvation] saw their thoughts and said to them: “Why do you think evil in your heart?”
Matthew,9,5,"“Which is easier to say: ‘Your sins are forgiven, or, rise walk’?"
Matthew,9,6,“But to inform you that the Son of Man is able to forgive sins on earth”; then he said to the sick man. “Arise and take your bed and walk”.
Matthew,9,7,He arose and went to his house.
Matthew,9,8,"The crowds saw, feared exceedingly, and praised The Mighty One Who had given power to men to do such things."
Matthew,9,9,"It came to pass when Yeshua [God is Salvation] passed on from there, he saw a man sitting at the table of exchange: Mattityahu [gift of Yah] was his name and he said to him: “Follow me”. So he arose and followed him."
Matthew,9,10,"He brought him to his house to eat. It came to pass while he was eating, that behold many tax collectors and sinners were at the table and behold they were dining with Yeshua [God is Salvation] and his disciples."
Matthew,9,11,The P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] saw and said to his disciples: Why does your Rabbi sit and eat with tax collectors and sinners?
Matthew,9,12,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] heard and said: “The healthy have no need for healing, but the sick”."
Matthew,9,13,“Go and learn that which is written: ‘I desire kindness and not sacrifice’; I have not come to call to restore the righteous but the ungodly”
Matthew,9,14,Then the disciples of Yochanan [Yah is gracious] came to him and said to him: ‘Why do we and the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] fast often but your disciples do not fast’?
Matthew,9,15,Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said to them: “The friends of the bridegroom cannot weep and fast while he is with them. The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast”
Matthew,9,16,“No man wastes a piece of new garment on an old garment because the force of the piece stretches the worn out garment and it tears more”
Matthew,9,17,"“Nor do they put new wine into old vessels lest the vessels break, and the wine spills out and the vessels perish. But, new wine is for new vessels and both of them are preserved”."
Matthew,9,18,"It came to pass when he had spoken to them, a captain approached and bowed down to him saying: ‘Adon [Lord - Kurios of the Earth] , my daughter just died. Please come and place your hand upon her and restore her to life’."
Matthew,9,19,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] arose and went, he and his disciples with him."
Matthew,9,20,Behold a woman with a flow of blood for twelve years came behind him and touched the fringe of his garment.
Matthew,9,21,She was saying in her heart: ‘If only I touch his garment. I will immediately be healed’.
Matthew,9,22,He turned and said to her: “Courage my daughter. By Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) be He; your healing is because of your faith”. In that same hour she was healed.
Matthew,9,23,"It came to pass when he entered the house of the captain, he saw many people weeping."
Matthew,9,24,He said to them: “Go outside all of you and stop weeping because the girl is asleep and not dead”. But in their eyes he was as one who jests. They were saying: ‘Have we not seen that she is dead’.
Matthew,9,25,"When he had put them outside, Yeshua [God is Salvation] went to her, touched her hand, and the girl arose."
Matthew,9,26,This report went out in all that land.
Matthew,9,27,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] passed on from there, and behold two blind men were running after him and crying out to him: ‘Have mercy on us, Ben David [Beloved] ’."
Matthew,9,28,"He came to the house, and the blind men drew near to him. He asked them: “Do you believe that I able to do this? They said to him: ‘Yes Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth]’. He said:"
Matthew,9,29,“Your faith will heal you”
Matthew,9,30,The eyes of the two men were immediately opened and they saw. He commanded them saying: “Be careful lest the matter be made known”
Matthew,9,31,As for them they went out and made it known in all that land.
Matthew,9,32,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] went out from there, and they brought before him a dumb man who was demon possessed."
Matthew,9,33,He cast out the demon so that the dumb man spoke. The crowds were amazed and said: ‘We have not seen it like this in Y’sra’el [he who holds onto the heal of God] ’.
Matthew,9,34,The P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] said: ‘Truly in the name of demons he casts out demons’.
Matthew,9,35,He went around all the cities and towns teaching in the synagogues and preaching the good news and healing every illness and every sickness.
Matthew,9,36,Yeshua [God is Salvation] saw the crowds and had pity on them because they were weary and wandering like sheep without a shepherd.
Matthew,9,37,Then he said to his disciples: “The standing grain is much but the reapers are few”.
Matthew,9,38,"“Entreat, now, ADON [LORD OF THE EARTH] AY of the standing grain that He send many reapers to harvest His grain”."
Matthew,10,1,Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] called his twelve disciples and gave them power over every unclean Spirit [Ruach] to cast them out from man and to heal every sickness and every plague.

Matthew,10,3,"Philip [friend of horses] and Bar- Talmai [abounding in furrows] and Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] and Yochanan [Yah is gracious] his brother, sons of Zavdai [Yah has bestowed] . T’oma [twin] and Mattityahu [gift of Yah] , who by reputation was a lender of money for interest. Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] Bar-Halfai [son of “changing”] and Y’hudah [Praise]."
Matthew,10,4,"Shim’on [he has heard] the Kenani [merchant] and Y’hudah [praised] From K’riot [cities] , who after this betrayed him."

Matthew,10,24,"“No disciple is greater than his Rabbi, nor is the slave greater than his Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] ”."
Matthew,10,25,"“It is sufficient for the disciple to be like his Rabbi and for the slave to be like his Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] . If they call the Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] of the house Ba’al-zevuv [Lord - Kurios of the Flies] , so much the more the sons of his house”."
Matthew,10,26,"“Do not fear them, because there is nothing which will not be seen, nor hidden which will not be made known”."

Matthew,11,1,It came to pass; when Yeshua [God is Salvation] finished teaching his twelve disciples; that he passed on from there after he commanded them to teach and reprove in their cities.
Matthew,11,2,Yochanan [Yah is gracious] ; when he was in prison; heard of the works of Yeshua [God is Salvation] and sent two of his disciples
Matthew,11,3,saying to him: ‘Are you the One who is to come or should we expect another?’
Matthew,11,4,Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them: “Go and tell Yochanan [Yah is gracious] that which you have seen and that which you have heard”:
Matthew,11,5,"“the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are revived, and the poor are acquitted”."
Matthew,11,6,“Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) is he who is not confused concerning me”.
Matthew,11,7,It came to pass as they were going that Yeshua [God is Salvation] began to speak to the crowds about Yochanan [Yah is gracious] “You went out into the wilderness to see what? A reed cast about by the wind”?
Matthew,11,8,“Or what did you go out to see? Do you think that Yochanan [Yah is gracious] was a man clothed in noble garments? Behold those who wear noble garments are in kings houses”.

Matthew,11,11,"Again Yeshua [God is Salvation] ‘said to his disciples: “Truly I say to you, among all those born of women none has arisen greater than Yochanan [Yah is gracious] the Baptizer”."
Matthew,11,12,“From his days until now ‘The Kingdom of heaven’ has been preached and senseless persons have been tearing it to pieces”.
Matthew,11,13,“For all the prophets and the law spoke concerning Yochanan [Yah is gracious] ”
Matthew,11,14,"“If you wish to receive it, he is Eliyahu [my God is Yah] u [my God is Yah] who is going to come”."

Matthew,11,17,“saying: ‘We sang to you and you did not dance; we wailed for you and you did not weep’”.
Matthew,11,18,“Because Yochanan [Yah is gracious] came neither eating nor drinking and they say concerning him: ‘He is possessed of demons’”.
Matthew,11,19,"“But the Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say concerning him: ‘He is a glutton, a drunkard, and a friend to tax collectors and sinners. So fools judge the wise”."
Matthew,11,20,"Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] began to curse the cities in which his signs were done, for they did not turn in repentance."
Matthew,11,21,"“Woe to you Korazin [here is a mystery] and woe to you Beit-Tzaidah [house of fish] , for if in Tzor [rock] and Sodom [burnt] the signs had been done which were done in you, they would have turned in repentance at that time in sack cloth and ashes”."
Matthew,11,22,"“Truly I say to you, it shall be easier for Tzor [rock] and Sodom [burnt] in the judgment than for you”."
Matthew,11,23,"“You K’far-Nachum [town of comfort] , will you ascend to heaven? From there you will be brought down. Because if in Sodom [burnt] , the signs which were done in you had been done, perhaps she would have remained. Unto Sh’ol [underworld] you will be brought down”"
Matthew,11,24,“Truly I say to you that it shall be easier for the land of Sodom [burnt] in the day of judgment than for you”.

Matthew,11,30,“Because my yoke is easy and my burden is light”
Matthew,12,1,"At that time Yeshua [God is Salvation] passed through the standing grain on the Shabbat [rest] day, and his disciples, being hungry, began to pluck the ears and to crush them between their hands and to eat them."
Matthew,12,2,The P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] saw it and said to him: ‘Look! your disciples are doing that which is not proper (one’s own; peculiar; particular) to do on the Shabbat [rest] day’.
Matthew,12,3,Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them: “Have you not read what David [Beloved] did when he was hungry and his men”
Matthew,12,4,"“in the house of Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] when they ate from the show-bread, which is not to be eaten except by the priests alone?”"
Matthew,12,5,“Also in the Torah have you not read that the priests in the temple sometimes Profane (treat as common; defile) the Shabbat [rest] and are without sin?”
Matthew,12,6,“Truly I say to you that This Temple is greater”.
Matthew,12,7,“If you had known what this means: ‘I desire kindness and not sacrifice’ you would not have convicted the innocent”
Matthew,12,8,“For the Son of Man is Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] of the Shabbat [rest] ”.
Matthew,12,9,It came to pass at the end of those days that Yeshua [God is Salvation] passed on from there and entered into their Synagogue.
Matthew,12,10,A man was there with a withered hand: so they asked him saying: ‘Is it permissible to heal him on the Shabbat [rest] ?’
Matthew,12,11,He said to them: “Who among you has a sheep that falls into a pit on the Shabbat [rest] day and does not raise it up?”
Matthew,12,12,“So much the more precious is a man than that. Therefore it is permissible for man to be made well on the Shabbat [rest] ”
Matthew,12,13,Then he said to the man: “Stretch out your hand”. He stretched it out and it was restored like the other.
Matthew,12,14,Then the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] took counsel and plotted to put him to death.
Matthew,12,15,It came to pass after this that Yeshua [God is Salvation] knew it; so he turned aside from there. Many sick followed him and he healed all of them.
Matthew,12,16,He commanded them saying not to reveal him
Matthew,12,17,in order to fulfill what was spoken by Yesha’yahu [the salvation of our God] the Prophet:
Matthew,12,18,"“Behold My slave whom I uphold, My Chosen One in whom my soul is delighted: I have put My Ruach [Spirit [Ruach] ] upon him, and he will declare justice to the nations."
Matthew,12,19,“He will not cry out nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street”.
Matthew,12,20,“A crushed reed he will not break and a dimly burning wick he will not quench; he will establish justice according to the truth; he will not fail or be discouraged until he establishes justice in the earth”
Matthew,12,21,“and the Goyim [Gentiles] shall wait for his teaching”
Matthew,12,22,Then there was brought to him a blind and dumb man who was demon possessed; he healed him. The crowds saw
Matthew,12,23,and were amazed and said: ‘Is this not the Son of David [Beloved] ’?
Matthew,12,24,"The P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] were quick to hear and said: ‘This one does not cast out demons except by Ba’al-zevuv [Lord - Kurios of the Flies] , the lord of demons’"
Matthew,12,25,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] knew their thoughts and said to them in a parable: “Every kingdom among you divided shall be made desolate, and also every city or house, upon which division shall fall, shall not stand”"
Matthew,12,26,"“If Satan [the adversary] casts out another Satan [the adversary] , there will be division among them; how will his kingdom stand?"
Matthew,12,27,"“If I cast out demons by Ba’al-zevuv [Lord - Kurios of the Flies] , why do your sons not cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges”"
Matthew,12,28,"“But if I cast out demons by The Ruach [Spirit [Ruach] ] of Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] , truly the Kingdom of heaven has come”"
Matthew,12,29,“How shall a man be able to enter the house of the strong man to take his goods unless he binds him first? Then he shall plunder his house”.
Matthew,12,30,“Whoever is not with me is against me. Whoever does not join himself to me denies me”
Matthew,12,31,"“Therefore I say to you that every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven the sons of men, but blasphemy of The Ruach [Spirit [Ruach] ] will not be forgiven”"
Matthew,12,32,"“Everyone who says a word against The Son of Man, it will be forgiven him. But everyone who says a word against Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit [Ruach] ), it will not be forgiven him, either in this world, or in the world to come”"
Matthew,12,33,"“Determine the tree good because of good fruit, or the tree bad because of bad fruit; because the tis; from the fruit the tree will be known”"
Matthew,12,34,"“Family of vipers, how can you speak good things when you are evil?. Surely the mouth opens, the heart speaks”"
Matthew,12,35,“A good man from the treasure of a good heart brings forth good; an evil man from the treasure of an evil heart brings forth evil”
Matthew,12,36,“I say to you that for all the words which a man shall speak he will be obliged to give an account on the day of judgment”.
Matthew,12,37,“According to your words you will be judged and according to your deeds you will be convicted”.
Matthew,12,38,"At that time, some of the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] and Torah-teachers (Scribes) came to Yeshua [God is Salvation] saying: We wish to see a sign from heaven by you."
Matthew,12,39,"He said to them: “An evil and ungodly generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Yonah [dove] the Prophet."
Matthew,12,40,"“For as he was in the bowels (inward parts; affections) of the fish three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the belly of the earth, buried for three days and three nights”."
Matthew,12,41,"“The men of Ninevah will rise up in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it, because they turned in repentance at the words of Yonah [dove] and I am greater than Yonah [dove] ”"
Matthew,12,42,"“The queen of Sheba, will rise up in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold! I am greater than Solomon”"
Matthew,12,43,"“When the unclean Spirit [Ruach] goes out from the man, he goes through waterless places seeking rest, but does not find it”"
Matthew,12,44,"“Then he says: ‘I will return to my house from which I came out, and he goes and finds it empty, safe and ready”"
Matthew,12,45,"“Then he takes seven spirits more evil than himself, and they go with him and they dwell there, and the latter state of the man is worse than his first. Thus it will be with this evil generation”."
Matthew,12,46,"While he was speaking to all the crowds, behold his mother and his brothers were standing outside seeking him to speak with him."
Matthew,12,47,A man said to him: ‘Look! your mother and your brothers are seeking to see you’
Matthew,12,48,He answered the one who spoke to him: “Who are my brothers and who is my mother?”
Matthew,12,49,He stretched out his hands to his disciples and said: “These are my mother and brothers”
Matthew,12,50,"“Everyone who does the will of my Father Who is in heaven, is my brother, my sister, and my mother.”"
Matthew,13,1,On that day Yeshua [God is Salvation] went out of the house and sat on the shore of the sea.
Matthew,13,2,Crowds joined themselves to him until he needed to enter a boat; the whole crowd was standing on the shore.
Matthew,13,3,He spoke to them many things in parables and said to them: “A man went forth from his house in the morning to sow his seed.”
Matthew,13,4,"“In his sowing some of it fell on the road, and the birds ate it.”"
Matthew,13,5,"“Some of it fell among rocks where there was no density of soil, and when it sprang up it withered because there was not much soil there.”"
Matthew,13,6,"“When the sun above it became warm, it was burned and dried up because it had no root.”"
Matthew,13,7,"“Some of it fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew and darkened it.”"
Matthew,13,8,"“Some of it fell on good ground and made fruit and produced, the first a hundredfold, the second sixty and the third thirty.”"
Matthew,13,9,“Whoever has ears to hear let him hear”
Matthew,13,10,Then his disciples drew near to him and his disciples said to him: ‘Why do you speak in parables?’
Matthew,13,11,He said: “To you it has been given to know ‘the Kingdom of heaven’ but not to them.”
Matthew,13,12,"“Whoever has, more will be given to him but whoever has nothing, that which he thinks he has will be taken from him”"
Matthew,13,13,"“For this reason I speak in parables because they see but do not see, hear but do not hear,”"
Matthew,13,14,"“in order to fulfill what was said through Yesha’yahu [the salvation of our God] the Prophet: ‘Go, and tell this people: hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.”"
Matthew,13,15,"“Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they, seeing with their eyes, and hearing with their ears, and understanding with their heart, return, and be healed.”"
Matthew,13,16,“Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) are your eyes that see and your ears that hear.”
Matthew,13,17,"“Truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”"
Matthew,13,18,“But hear you the parable of the sower.”
Matthew,13,19,"“The Sower is The Son of Man, and the seed which fell on the road is everyone who hears ‘The Kingdom of heaven’ and does not understand it. Satan [the adversary] comes and snatches away from his heart everything which was sown in it. This is the seed which fell on the road.”"
Matthew,13,20,“That which fell among the rocks is the one who hears the word of Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] and receives it immediately with joy.”
Matthew,13,21,"“But he is without root and is confused and when a little trouble and distress come to him because of the word, Satan [the adversary] causes him to forget from his heart.”"
Matthew,13,22,"“That which fell among the thorns, this is the one who hears the word and in his desire to gather wealth, Satan [the adversary] causes him to forget the word of Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] and makes no fruit.”"
Matthew,13,23,"“That which fell into the good earth is the one who hears the word and understands it and makes fruit, that is, from good works. He brings forth from the first a hundred, from the second sixty, and from the third thirty. As for the hundred, this is the one purified of heart and sanctified of body. As for the sixty, this is the one separated from women. As for the thirty, this is the one sanctified in matrimony, in body and in heart.”"
Matthew,13,24,He set before them another parable. “The Kingdom of heaven is like a man who sows good seed in his field.”
Matthew,13,25,"“It came to pass when the men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares over the wheat, and he went away.”"
Matthew,13,26,"“It came to pass that when the herb grew up to make fruit, then he saw the tares”."
Matthew,13,27,"“The servants of the landowner drew near to him and said to him; ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed, then where did the tares come from?’”"
Matthew,13,28,"“He said to them, ‘My enemy did this! His servants said to him: ‘We will uproot the tares’”"
Matthew,13,29,"“He said to them: ‘No, lest you uproot the wheat’”"
Matthew,13,30,“But let them remain together and grow up until the harvest and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers: ‘Gather the tares first and bind them into individual bundles for burning and the wheat put into the granary’”
Matthew,13,31,He set before them another parable. “The Kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard which a man takes and sows in the field.”
Matthew,13,32,"“It is smaller than all garden herbs, but when it grows up it is greater than all herbs and is made into a great tree until the birds of heaven withdraw into its branches.”"
Matthew,13,33,He spoke to them another parable. “The Kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman puts into three measures of flour and it leavens all of it”.
Matthew,13,34,"All of these parables Yeshua [God is Salvation] spoke to the crowds and without a parable he did not speak to them,"
Matthew,13,35,to fulfill what was said according to the prophet: “I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter riddles from ancient times”
Matthew,13,36,Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] was parted from the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and asked him to explain for them the parable of the tares.
Matthew,13,37,"He answered and said to them: “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,"
Matthew,13,38,"“and the field is this world, the good seed are the righteous. The tares are the ungodly,”"
Matthew,13,39,"“and the enemy who sowed them is Satan [the adversary] . The standing grain at the end is the world to come, and the reapers are the angels.”"
Matthew,13,40,"“As the reapers gather the tares to burn in the fire, so will it be at the end of the days.”"
Matthew,13,41,"“The Son of Man will send His angels to uproot from his Kingdom all stumbling blocks, and all who do iniquity,”"
Matthew,13,42,“and they will cast them into the pyre of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
Matthew,13,43,"“Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear”."
Matthew,13,44,Again Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “The Kingdom of heaven is like a man who finds a treasure which had been hidden and in gladness over the value he sells all which he has and buys the field for himself”.
Matthew,13,45,“Again the Kingdom of heaven is like a certain merchant seeking precious stones.”
Matthew,13,46,"“When he finds a good one, he sells all which he has and buys it”"
Matthew,13,47,“The Kingdom of heaven is like a net in the midst of the sea in which are gathered all kinds of fish.”
Matthew,13,48,"“When it is full, they draw it out on the shore, and the fishermen go forth and choose the good for their vessels and the bad they cast away.”"
Matthew,13,49,“Thus it will be at the end of days; the angels will go forth and separate the ungodly from the midst of the righteous.”
Matthew,13,50,“Then they shall cast them into the pyre of fire; in that place shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth”
Matthew,13,51,He said to them: “Have you understood this?” They said: ‘Yes’.
Matthew,13,52,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to them, “Therefore every wise man in the Kingdom of heaven is like a certain father of children, who brings forth from his treasure things new and old.”"
Matthew,13,53,"It came to pass after this, when Yeshua [God is Salvation] finished these words, he passed on from there."
Matthew,13,54,He came into his own country and was teaching the people in the synagogues. The P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] were amazed and said in their heart: ‘From where did the wisdom and power to do such deeds come to this one?’
Matthew,13,55,"‘Is this not the son of the smith and Miryam [waters of strength] ? Do you not know all these: his mother Miryam [waters of strength] , his three brothers; Yosef [he will add] , Shim’on [he has heard] and Y’hudah [Praise] ,’"
Matthew,13,56,‘and his sisters? Do you not know all these who are with us?. From where did all these things come to this one?’
Matthew,13,57,"So they were confused about him. Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them: “A prophet is not without honour except in his own land, city and house”"
Matthew,13,58,Then he did not wish to do there any sign because of their unbelief.
Matthew,14,1,At that time Herod [heroic] the Tetrarch heard reports about Yeshua [God is Salvation].
Matthew,14,2,He said to his servants: ‘Behold I believe that Yochanan [Yah is gracious] the Baptizer is doing these miracles’.
Matthew,14,3,This happened because Herod [heroic] had seized Yochanan [Yah is gracious] in those days bound him in prison because he was reproving him that he should not take Herodias for a wife because she was the wife of his brother.
Matthew,14,4,Yochanan [Yah is gracious] was saying to him: “She is not permissible to you”.
Matthew,14,5,"Then behold Herod [heroic] wished to kill him, but he feared the people who believed that Yochanan [Yah is gracious] was a prophet among them."
Matthew,14,6,"On the feast of Herod [heroic] ’s birthday, he called the nobles of his kingdom to eat with him, and while they were eating, his daughter danced among them and it was pleasing to Herod [heroic]."
Matthew,14,7,He swore to give her whatever she asked from him.
Matthew,14,8,"The girl being instructed by her mother, asked for the head of Yochanan [Yah is gracious] the Baptizer in a bowl."
Matthew,14,9,The king was very sad because of the oath which he had made before those invited. But he commanded to do so
Matthew,14,10,and sent to kill Yochanan [Yah is gracious] in prison.
Matthew,14,11,They brought the head of Yochanan [Yah is gracious] in a bowl and gave it to the girl and the girl gave it to her mother.
Matthew,14,12,Then the disciples of Yochanan [Yah is gracious] came and took the body and buried it and the disciples told the matter to Yeshua [God is Salvation].
Matthew,14,13,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] heard it, he departed from there in a boat and went into the wilderness of Y’huda [praise] . When the crowds heard they followed him from all the cities."
Matthew,14,14,When they came out he saw behind him a numerous people; so he extended kindness to them and healed all their diseases.
Matthew,14,15,At evening time his disciples came to him and said to him: ‘This place is limited and the time is advancing. Let the crowds go into the towns that they might buy food for themselves’.
Matthew,14,16,Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered: “They have no need to go; give them to eat”.
Matthew,14,17,They answered: ‘We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish’.
Matthew,14,18,He said to them: “Bring them to me”.
Matthew,14,19,"Then he commanded that the people should sit on the grass. When they sat he took the five loaves and two fish and as he looked into heaven he Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) them, divided them, and gave them to his disciples and the disciples made distribution to the groups."
Matthew,14,20,"All of them ate and were satisfied. They also ate the fish according to what they desired. After they had finished, they took the fragments, which remained, and filled twelve baskets with them."
Matthew,14,21,The number of those eating was five thousand men apart from women and children.
Matthew,14,22,"After this, he commanded his disciples to assemble in a boat that they might go before him to the city to which the crowds were going."
Matthew,14,23,After he left the crowds he went up on a mountain and prayed alone. At the time of evening he was standing alone.
Matthew,14,24,The boat was in the midst of the sea and the waves of the sea were driving it because the wind was contrary.
Matthew,14,25,At the fourth watch of the night Yeshua [God is Salvation] came to them walking on the sea.
Matthew,14,26,"When his disciples saw him walking on the sea they were alarmed, thinking he was a demon, and from the greatness of their fear they were crying out."
Matthew,14,27,Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them and said to them: “Let faith be among you because it is I; do not fear”.
Matthew,14,28,"Kefa [pebble] answered and said to him: ‘My Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] , if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
Matthew,14,29,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to him: “Come”. So Kefa [pebble] came down from the boat, walked on the sea, and came to Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
Matthew,14,30,"But when he saw the strength of the wind he feared exceedingly and as he began to sink cried out and said: ‘My Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] , save me’."
Matthew,14,31,"Immediately Yeshua [God is Salvation] stretched out his hand, took him, and said to him: “Man of little faith, why did you doubt?”"
Matthew,14,32,"When they went up into the boat, the wind became quiet,"
Matthew,14,33,"and those in the boat did homage to him and said: ‘Truly, you are the Son of The Mighty One’."
Matthew,14,34,They crossed over and they came to the land of Ginosar [a garden of riches].
Matthew,14,35,When the people of the place recognized him they sent into all that kingdom and brought to him all who were sick with various kinds of diseases.
Matthew,14,36,"They implored him that he might be pleased to allow them to touch the hem of his garment, and each one who touched it was healed."
Matthew,15,1,Then the Torah-teachers (Scribes) and the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] came to Yeshua [God is Salvation] and said to him:
Matthew,15,2,‘Why do your disciples transgress the ordinances of antiquity by not washing their hands before eating?’
Matthew,15,3,Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to them: “Why do you transgress the words of The Most High because of your ordinances?”
Matthew,15,4,For The Mighty One said: “Honour your father and your mother and he who curses his father and mother will surely be put to death”
Matthew,15,5,"“But you say that ‘whoever says to his father and his mother; in regard to any donation he might give; ‘Whatever I have that would help you has been given to Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] ,’”"
Matthew,15,6,"“So he does not honour his father and his mother, and you despise the words of The Mighty One because of your ordinances”."
Matthew,15,7,"“Woe, hypocrites, behold Yesha’yahu [the salvation of our God] prophesied concerning you and said:"
Matthew,15,8,"“Thus Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] said: Because this people has come near with their mouth and has honored Me with their lips, but their heart is far from me”"
Matthew,15,9,"“And their reverence towards Me, which is taught, is the commandments of men”."
Matthew,15,10,Yeshua [God is Salvation] called to the crowds and said to them: “Hear and consider.”
Matthew,15,11,"“That which enters through the mouth does not soil the man, but that which goes out of the mouth soils the man”"
Matthew,15,12,Then his disciples came to him and said to him: ‘Know that the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] were perplexed by this word’.
Matthew,15,13,Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them: “Every plant which my Father Who is in heaven did not plant will be uprooted and destroyed”.
Matthew,15,14,"“Leave them alone because the blind are leading the blind, and if a blind man leads another who is blind, they will both fall into a pit”."
Matthew,15,15,Kefa [pebble] answered him: “My Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] explain this riddle to us”
Matthew,15,16,Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them: “Are you still without knowledge?”
Matthew,15,17,“Do you not understand that everything that enters through the mouth goes into the belly and all of it goes on to the natural place?”
Matthew,15,18,“But that which goes out through the mouth is moved by the heart; this is what soils the man.”
Matthew,15,19,"“Because the defiled heart brings forth deceitfulness, murder, adulteries, robberies, the witness of liars and curses”."
Matthew,15,20,“All these things are what soil the man. Indeed eating without washing the hands does not soil the man”.
Matthew,15,21,"After Yeshua [God is Salvation] had said this, he went into the regions of Tzor [rock] and Tzidon [hunting]"
Matthew,15,22,"Then there came to him a certain Kenani [merchant] woman, who came from the lands of the East, crying out to him: ‘My lord, son of David [Beloved] , have mercy on me because my daughter is possessed by demons’."
Matthew,15,23,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] did not answer her a word. So his disciples approached him and said to him: ‘Our Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] , why do you abandon this woman who is crying after us?’"
Matthew,15,24,Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them: “I was not sent except to the lost sheep from the house of Y’sra’el [he who holds onto the heal of God] ”.
Matthew,15,25,Then the woman did homage to him and said: ‘My Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] help me’.
Matthew,15,26,Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to her: “It is not good that a man should take the bread from his children and give it to the dogs”.
Matthew,15,27,The woman answered: ‘Often the dogs eat the pieces of bread that fall from the table of their master’.
Matthew,15,28,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered her: “Woman, great is your faith, let it be done to you as you asked”. So from that time on, her daughter was healed."
Matthew,15,29,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] moved on from there, he went into the region across Galil [circuit] to a mountain. As he stood there"
Matthew,15,30,"he saw many people among whom were many lame, leprous, those who limped, and many others; they fell at his feet and he healed them."
Matthew,15,31,The people were amazed at how the dumb were speaking and the lame were walking and the blind were seeing; all of them were praising The Most High.
Matthew,15,32,Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “I have compassion on them because they have remained with me these two days since they came across and they have nothing to eat. I do not want to leave them fasting lest they grow give up in the way”.
Matthew,15,33,His disciples answered him: ‘Where will we be able to find bread in this wilderness to satisfy the people?’
Matthew,15,34,Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said to them: “How many loaves of bread do you have?” They answered: ‘Seven and a few fish’.
Matthew,15,35,So Yeshua [God is Salvation] commanded the people to sit upon the grass.
Matthew,15,36,He took the seven loaves and the fish and broke them and gave them to his disciples and they gave to the people.
Matthew,15,37,All of them ate and were satisfied and from that which was remaining they filled seven baskets.
Matthew,15,38,"Those who were eating were by number, four thousand men besides women and children."
Matthew,15,39,After this Yeshua [God is Salvation] entered a boat and came to the land of Magadan [tower].
Matthew,16,1,"Tz’dukim (Sadducees) [followers of the right] and P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] came to him, tempting him to show them some sign from heaven."
Matthew,16,2,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them: “Hypocrites, you say in the evening: Tomorrow will be a clear day because the sky is red”."
Matthew,16,3,"“Then in the morning you say: ‘Today it will rain because the sky is dark’. If so, you know the law regarding the appearance of the sky, but you do not know the law regarding the times”."
Matthew,16,4,"“The offspring of evil-doers ask for a sign, but no sign will be given them except the sign of Yonah [dove] the Prophet”. Then he was separated from them and went away."
Matthew,16,5,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] came to the seashore he told his disciples to beware of their bread. Then he entered a boat with his disciples, but the disciples forgot and did not bring any bread."
Matthew,16,6,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to them, “Watch out and beware of the leaven of the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] and Tz’dukim (Sadducees) [followers of the right] .”"
Matthew,16,7,"They began to discuss this among themselves, saying, “He said that because we did not bring any bread.”"
Matthew,16,8,Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to them: “You have little understanding who think that you have no bread”.
Matthew,16,9,"“Do you not remember the five loaves and the five thousand men”,"
Matthew,16,10,"“Or the seven loaves and the four thousand men, how many baskets were left over?”"
Matthew,16,11,“Therefore you should understand that I am not speaking of natural loaves”
Matthew,16,12,“but I am saying to you that you should beware of the teachings of the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] and Tz’dukim (Sadducees) [followers of the right] ”.
Matthew,16,13,Yeshua [God is Salvation] went out into the Land of ‘Caesarea [severed] of Philip [friend of horses] ’ and asked his disciples saying: “What do men say about me?”
Matthew,16,14,"They said unto him: “Some say ‘he is Yochanan [Yah is gracious] the Baptizer’, some say ‘he is Eliyahu [my God is Yah] u [my God is Yah] ’, and some ‘Yirmeyahu [Our God has uplifted] ’ or ‘one of the prophets’”."
Matthew,16,15,Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to them: “What do you say about me?”
Matthew,16,16,"Shim’on [he has heard] ; called Kefa [pebble] ; answered and said: “You are Ha-Moshiach [Messiah] [The Messiah] [which means ‘the Messiah’] , the Son of the Living Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] , who has come into this world”"
Matthew,16,17,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to him: “Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) are you Shim’on [he has heard] bar Yonah [dove] , because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father Who is in heaven”"
Matthew,16,18,"“I say to you: ‘You are Even [which means a pebble] and I will build upon you my house of prayer. The fortresses (Daniel 11:38,39) of Hell will not gain the upper hand against you”"
Matthew,16,19,"“because I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”"
Matthew,16,20,Then he commanded his disciples not to say that he is Ha-Moshiach [Messiah] [The Messiah].
Matthew,16,21,"From then on Yeshua [God is Salvation] began to reveal to his disciples that it was necessary for him to go to Yerushalayim [abode of peace] and to suffer (allow, to let, permit) the injustice of many, from the chief priests and from the elders of the people until they should kill him; then on the third day he would arise."
Matthew,16,22,"Kefa [pebble] took him aside privately and began to rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) him saying: ‘Far be it that it should be like this to you, Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth]’."
Matthew,16,23,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] turned, looked at him, and said “Go away Satan [the adversary] ; do not disobey me, because you do not regard the word of The Mighty One but the words of man”"
Matthew,16,24,Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “Whoever wishes to come after me let him despise himself and come after me”.
Matthew,16,25,"“Everyone who wishes to save his soul will lose it for my sake, and he who loses his life in this world for my sake will save his soul for the life of the world to come”."
Matthew,16,26,"“What profit is there for a man if he should gain the whole world and lose his soul forever; what good exchange does a man make if, for present things that are spoiled, he should give his soul to the judgment of Gei-Hinnom [hell, valley of evil counsel] ?”"
Matthew,16,27,“Because the Son of The Mighty One will come in the glory of his Father Who is in heaven with his angels to reward each man according to his work”.
Matthew,16,28,“Truly I say to you there are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of The Mighty One coming in his Kingdom.”
Matthew,17,1,"After six days Yeshua [God is Salvation] took Kefa [pebble] , Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] and Yochanan [Yah is gracious] his brother and brought them to a high mountain where he might pray."
Matthew,17,2,While he was praying he was changed before them and the skin of his face shone like the sun and his garments became white like snow.
Matthew,17,3,"Then Moshe [drawn out] and Eliyahu [my God is Yah] , while speaking with him, were revealed to them and they told Yeshua [God is Salvation] all which would happen to him in Yerushalayim [abode of peace] . Kefa [pebble] and his companions were asleep. Asleep but not asleep; awake but not awake. They saw his body and the two men with him."
Matthew,17,4,"When they went away, then Kefa [pebble] said to Yeshua [God is Salvation] : ‘It is good to be here. Let us make here three tabernacles, one for you, one for Moshe [drawn out] , and one for Eliyahu [my God is Yah] ’, because he did not know what he was saying."
Matthew,17,5,"While he was still speaking, behold a cloud covered them and they were greatly alarmed. While they were under the cloud they heard from the midst of the cloud a voice speaking and saying: “Behold, this is My Son My beloved, My delight is in him, you shall obey him”"
Matthew,17,6,"The disciples heard, fell on their faces to the ground, and feared exceedingly."
Matthew,17,7,"When the Voice ceased, Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to them: “Arise, do not fear”"
Matthew,17,8,They lifted up their eyes and saw no one except Yeshua [God is Salvation] alone.
Matthew,17,9,Yeshua [God is Salvation] came down from the mountain and commanded them saying: “Tell no man the vision you have seen until the Son of Man has risen from death”.
Matthew,17,10,His disciples asked him saying: “Why do the Torah-teachers (Scribes) say that Eliyahu [my God is Yah] will come first?
Matthew,17,11,He answered them and said: “Indeed Eliyahu [my God is Yah] will come and will restore to repentance all the world”.
Matthew,17,12,"“I say to you, he has already come, they did not know him, and they did to him according to their desire. So they will do to the Son of Man”."
Matthew,17,13,Then the disciples understood that regarding Yochanan [Yah is gracious] the Baptizer he was saying this.
Matthew,17,14,"It came to pass when he approached the crowds, a man came to him, bowing on his knees."
Matthew,17,15,"He said: ‘Have mercy on me my Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] , and pity my son because he is terrified of an evil Spirit [Ruach] and is very sick. He grinds his teeth, foams at his mouth, falls from his place to the ground, and falls sometimes into fire and sometimes into water’."
Matthew,17,16,"I brought him to your disciples, but they were unable to heal him."
Matthew,17,17,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said: “Evil generation, woe to you who deny me; how long will I be with you, how long will I bear your trouble? Bring him to me”."
Matthew,17,18,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was cured at once."
Matthew,17,19,The disciples drew near to Yeshua [God is Salvation] secretly and said to him: “Why were we not able to cast it out”
Matthew,17,20,"He said to them: “Because of the limitation of your faith. Truly I say to you, if there be any faith in you, as a grain of mustard, if you believe, you will say to this mountain depart and it will depart; nothing will be withheld from you.”"
Matthew,17,21,“But this kind of demon does not come out except by prayer and fasting.
Matthew,17,22,They were in Galil [circuit] and Yeshua [God is Salvation] said: “The Son of Man will be delivered into the hand of men”
Matthew,17,23,“They will kill him and on the third day he will arise”.
Matthew,17,24,The came to K’far-Nachum [town of comfort] -Marta [she was rebellious] and the tax collectors drew near to Kefa [pebble] and said to him: “Your teacher does not follow the custom to pay tax”
Matthew,17,25,"Thus they spoke. He went into the house and Yeshua [God is Salvation] anticipated him saying to Kefa [pebble] “What is your judgment Kefa [pebble] , the kings of the earth, from whom do they take tribute, from their sons or from foreigners?”"
Matthew,17,26,"He answered him: “From foreigners”. Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to him: “If so, then, the sons are free”. Then he said: “Do not be dismayed because of this”."
Matthew,17,27,"He said to Kefa [pebble] “Go to the sea and cast a fishing hook and fish with it, because, in the mouth of the one you will catch first, you will find a silver coin. That you will give for us”"
Matthew,18,1,At that time the disciples drew near to Yeshua [God is Salvation] and said to him: ‘Whom do you think is the greatest in the Kingdom of heaven?’
Matthew,18,2,He called a small child and placed him in their midst.
Matthew,18,3,"He said: “I say to you, if you do not turn to become like this child, you will not enter the Kingdom of heaven”"
Matthew,19,1,It came to pass when Yeshua [God is Salvation] finished these words he passed on from Galil [circuit] and came to the outskirts of the land of Y’hudah [Praise] across the Yarden [descender].
Matthew,19,2,There followed him large crowds and he healed all of them.
Matthew,19,3,Then the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] came to him to tempt him. They asked him saying: ‘Is it permissible for one to leave his wife for any matter and to give her a bill of divorce’.
Matthew,19,4,"He answered them: “Have you not read that He who made them of old, male and female He created them”."
Matthew,19,5,He said: “Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and cleave (split open; cut open; divide) to his wife and they will become one flesh”.
Matthew,19,6,"“If so, they are not two but one flesh, and whatever The Creator has joined together man is unable to separate”"
Matthew,19,7,"They said to him: ‘If so, why did Moshe [drawn out] command to give her a bill of divorce and to send her away from his house?’"
Matthew,19,8,"He said to them: “Moshe [drawn out] , because of the obstinacy of your heart, said for you to leave your wives. But from the beginning it was not so”."
Matthew,19,9,"“I say to you that everyone who leaves his wife and takes another, commits adultery; and he who takes her who has been divorced commits adultery”."
Matthew,19,10,"Then his disciples said to him: ‘If the matter of a man with his wife is so, it is not good to take her’."
Matthew,19,11,He said to them: “This matter is not for everyone but for those to whom it has been given”.
Matthew,19,12,“Because there are eunuchs from their birth; these are those who have not sinned. There are eunuchs made by man and there are self-made eunuchs who subdue their desire for the sake of the Kingdom of heaven; these are those who enter into great prominence. Whoever is able to understand let him understand”.
Matthew,19,13,"Then they brought children to him that he might lay his hand on them and pray for them, but his disciples were driving them away."
Matthew,19,14,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to them: “Permit the children to come to me and do not restrain them, for the Kingdom of heaven is theirs. Truly I say to you that one will not enter the Kingdom of heaven except he shall be like these”."
Matthew,19,15,So he laid his hand on them and went on from there.
Matthew,19,16,A young man came to him doing homage to him and said to him: ‘Rabbi what good thing shall I do to acquire the life of the world to come?’
Matthew,19,17,He answered him: “Why do you ask me about good? No man is good; because The Mighty One alone is good. But if you wish to enter life keep the commandments”.
Matthew,19,18,"He said to him: ‘What are they?’ Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to him: “Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness against your neighbor”."
Matthew,19,19,“Honour your father and your mother and love your neighbour as yourself”
Matthew,19,20,"The young man said to him: ‘All these I have kept, so what, yet, do I lack?’"
Matthew,19,21,Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto him: “If you wish to be perfect go and sell all which you have and give it to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and follow me”.
Matthew,19,22,It came to pass when the young man heard he went away angry because he did not have much property.
Matthew,19,23,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of heaven”."
Matthew,19,24,"“Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than a rich man the Kingdom of heaven”"
Matthew,19,25,"The disciples heard and were exceedingly amazed and said to Yeshua [God is Salvation] : ‘If so, who can save?’"
Matthew,19,26,"He turned to them and said: “With man the matter is difficult, but with The Most High everything is easy”."
Matthew,19,27,Kefa [pebble] answered and said to him: ‘Behold we have left all to follow after you; what will be ours?’
Matthew,19,28,Yeshua [God is Salvation] said: “Truly I say to you who follow me; in the day of judgment when The Son of Man sits upon the throne of his glory you also will sit upon the twelve thrones of the twelve tribes of Y’sra’el [he who holds onto the heal of God] [he who holds onto the heal of God] ”
Matthew,19,29,"“Everyone who leaves his house, and his brothers, also his sisters, his father, his mother, his wife and his children for my name will receive a hundred like them and will inherit the Kingdom of heaven”"
Matthew,19,30,“Many who are first will be last and many who are last will be first”
Matthew,20,1,"After this Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “The Kingdom of heaven is like a certain individual, who was master in his house, who arose early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard”."
Matthew,20,2,“He hired them for one dinar a day and sent them into his vineyard”.
Matthew,20,3,“He went out at the third hour of the day and saw others standing idle in the market place”.
Matthew,20,4,"“He said to them: ‘Go, also you, into my vineyard and that which is suitable I will give to you’."
Matthew,20,5,“So they went. Then he came out again at noon and also at the ninth hour and did the same”.
Matthew,20,6,“At the eleventh hour he went out also and found others standing and he said to them: ‘Why do you stand idle all day?’
Matthew,20,7,"“They answered him: ‘No man has hired us’. So he said to them: ‘Go, also, you into my vineyard’."
Matthew,20,8,"“It came to pass at evening, the master of the vineyard said to the officer over the laborers: ‘Call them that I might give to them their wages’. He began with the last and finished with the first”."
Matthew,20,9,“The last received one dinar”.
Matthew,20,10,"“So the first thought they would receive more, but he gave only a dinar to each of them”."
Matthew,20,11,“Then the first murmured against the master of the vineyard
Matthew,20,12,“saying: ‘These last worked one hour and you have made them like us who have worked all day and in the heat’.
Matthew,20,13,"“He answered one of them and said to him: ‘My friend, I have done you no injustice. Did I not hire you for one dinar?’"
Matthew,20,14,‘Take it and go. If I wish to give this last like you’
Matthew,20,15,‘may I not do according to my desire? Is there evil in your eyes when I am good?’
Matthew,20,16,“So the last shall be first and the first last. Many are called but few are chosen”.
Matthew,20,17,Yeshua [God is Salvation] drew near to Yerushalayim [abode of peace] and took his twelve disciples and secretly said to them:
Matthew,20,18,“Behold we are going up to Yerushalayim [abode of peace] and the Son of Man will be delivered over unto the chief priests and Torah-teachers (Scribes) and they will condemn him to death”.
Matthew,20,19,"“Also they will deliver him to the Goyim [Gentiles] to mock and scourge and crucify him, but on the third day he will arise”."
Matthew,20,20,"Then came the wife of Zavdai [Yah has bestowed] with her sons, bowing down and making a request from him."
Matthew,20,21,He said to her: “What do you wish?” She said: ‘That you command these my two sons to sit the one on your right and the other on your left in your Kingdom’.
Matthew,20,22,Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them: “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to endure the suffering and death that I am going to endure?”. They said: ‘We are able’.
Matthew,20,23,"Then he said to them: “Drink my cup, but that you should sit on my left or my right is not for me to grant to you but to the one who is prepared before by my Father”"
Matthew,20,24,"The ten heard and it was a matter of anger, in their eyes, in regard to the two brothers."
Matthew,20,25,Yeshua [God is Salvation] brought them near to him and said to them: “Know that the princes of the Goyim [Gentiles] have dominion over them and their great ones seek to subdue them”.
Matthew,20,26,"“It will not be so among you, because he who wishes to be great among you will serve you”."
Matthew,20,27,"“He who among you who wishes to be first will be your slave”,"
Matthew,20,28,"“just as the Son of Man did not come that they might serve him, but that he might serve and give himself as a ransom for many”."
Matthew,20,29,They entered into Jericho and a crowd followed him.
Matthew,20,30,"Behold two blind men came out beside the road. They heard the noise of the multitude and asked what this might be. It was said to them: ‘The Prophet Yeshua [God is Salvation] from Natsrat is coming’. Then they cried out saying: ‘Son of David [Beloved] , have mercy on us’."
Matthew,20,31,"But the crowd rebuked them saying: “Be silent”; they nevertheless were crying out saying: ‘Adon [Lord - Kurios of the Earth] , Son of David [Beloved] , have mercy on us’."
Matthew,20,32,"So Yeshua [God is Salvation] ‘stopped, called them and said: “What do you want me to do for you?’”"
Matthew,20,33,"They said: ‘Adon [Lord - Kurios of the Earth] , that our eyes might be opened’."
Matthew,20,34,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] had pity on them, touched their eyes and said to them: “Your faith has healed you”. Immediately they saw, praised The Mighty One, and followed him. Then all the people praised The Mighty One, because of this."
Matthew,21,1,"They drew near to Yerushalayim [abode of peace] and came to Bethpage on the Mount of Olives, and Yeshua [God is Salvation] sent two of his disciples."
Matthew,21,2,He said unto them: “Go into the fortress which is opposite you and immediately you will find a she-ass and her colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me”.
Matthew,21,3,"“If a man should say anything to you, tell him the Master has need of them and immediately he will let them go.”"
Matthew,21,4,All this was to fulfill the word of the prophet saying:
Matthew,21,5,"“Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion, shout, O daughter of Yerushalayim [abode of peace] ; behold, thy King cometh unto thee, he is triumphant, and victorious, humble, and riding upon a she-ass, even upon a colt the foal of a she-ass”."
Matthew,21,6,They went and did as Yeshua [God is Salvation] commanded them.
Matthew,21,7,"They brought the she-ass and the colt, and when the others had placed their garments and clothes upon them, Yeshua [God is Salvation] rode upon them. Then they made the ascent."
Matthew,21,8,"Many of the crowd spread out their garments in the road, and others cut branches from trees and cast them before him and behind him,"
Matthew,21,9,calling out saying: “Please! Deliver us! [Hoshi-annah] in the Highest. Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) is He who comes in the name of Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] . Please! Deliver us! [Hoshi-annah] in the Highest”
Matthew,21,10,"It came to pass afterwards, when Yeshua [God is Salvation] entered Yerushalayim [abode of peace] , all the city was moved saying: ‘Who is this?’"
Matthew,21,11,The people said to one another: ‘Yeshua [God is Salvation] the Prophet from Natzeret [separated] which is in Galil [circuit] ’.
Matthew,21,12,Yeshua [God is Salvation] entered the house of Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] and found there those who buy and sell. He overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who were selling doves.
Matthew,21,13,"He said unto them: “It is written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations, but you have made it a cave of thieves’”."
Matthew,21,14,Then the blind and lame came to him in the temple and he healed them.
Matthew,21,15,"The chief priests and the Torah-teachers (Scribes) came to see the wonders which he did. The young children were calling out in the temple saying: “Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) is He who comes in The Name of Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] , the King of Y’sra’el [he who holds onto the heal of God] , the Son of The Mighty One”. The Torah-teachers (Scribes) deceived"
Matthew,21,16,and said to Him: ‘Have you not heard what these are saying?’ He answered them and said: “I heard them. Have you not read: ‘From the mouth of children and babes You have established strength’?”
Matthew,21,17,He left and went out to Beit-Anyah [house of figs] and spent the night there and there he was explaining to them the Kingdom of Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God].
Matthew,21,18,It came to pass in the morning that he returned to the city hungry.
Matthew,21,19,He saw a fig tree near the road and drew near to it but found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it: “May fruit never come forth from you”. Immediately the fig tree dried up.
Matthew,21,20,"The disciples saw, were amazed, and said: ‘How is it the fig tree dried up immediately?’"
Matthew,21,21,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said to them: “If you have faith without doubt, not only to the fig tree will you do, but should you say to this mountain that it should depart and go into the sea, it will be done”"
Matthew,21,22,"“Everything which you shall ask in prayer while believing, you will receive”."
Matthew,21,23,"He went into the temple to teach and there came unto him the Torah-teachers (Scribes) , the priests and the rulers of the people saying: ‘By what power do you do this and who gave you this strength?’"
Matthew,21,24,Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them and said to them: “I also will ask you a question and if you tell me I also will tell you by what power I work”.
Matthew,21,25,"“The baptism of Yochanan [Yah is gracious] from where was it, from heaven or from men?”. They grieved among themselves saying: ‘What will we say. If we say from heaven, he will say to us: Why did you not believe him?’"
Matthew,21,26,"‘If we say from men, we fear the crowd because all of them believe Yochanan [Yah is gracious] was a prophet.’"
Matthew,21,27,"So they said: ‘We do not know’. He said: “Also, I will not tell you by what power I work”"
Matthew,21,28,“What is your opinion? A certain man had two sons; he approached one and said to him: ‘Go my son today to work in my vineyard’.
Matthew,21,29,“He said to him: ‘I do not wish to’. But afterward he repented and went”.
Matthew,21,30,"“He said to the other likewise and he answered him: ‘Here I am, Sir’, but he did not go”."
Matthew,21,31,"“Which of the two did the will of the father?” They said to him: ‘The first’. Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to them: “Truly I say to you, tax collectors and harlots will precede you into the Kingdom of heaven,"
Matthew,21,32,“because Yochanan [Yah is gracious] came to you in the Way of righteousness and you did not believe him. But tax collectors and harlots believed him and you saw it and did not turn in repentance. Also afterward you did not repent to believe him. To the one who has ears to hear let him hear in disgrace.”
Matthew,21,33,"At that time Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples and to a company of the Jews: “Hear now the parable of the sower. A certain honorable man planted a vineyard, walled it up on every side, built a tower in its midst, and also dug a vat in it, entrusted it to servants, and went on his way”."
Matthew,21,34,"“It came to pass at the time of the gathering of the produce, he sent his servants to those who were working to receive his produce”."
Matthew,21,35,"“But the workers took his servants, struck the first, killed the second, and the third they stoned with stones”."
Matthew,21,36,“Again he sent many more servants than the first and they did to them likewise”.
Matthew,21,37,"“Finally, he sent them his son saying: ‘They will honour my son’”."
Matthew,21,38,"“The workers saw his son and said to one another: ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and we will inherit his estate’."
Matthew,21,39,"“So they took him, cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him”."
Matthew,21,40,"“Now, when the Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] of the vineyard comes what will he do to them?”"
Matthew,21,41,They answered him saying: “As for the wicked he will destroy them in misery and his vineyard he will give to other workers who will immediately give to him the portion of his produce.”
Matthew,21,42,Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to them: “Have you not read the scripture: ‘The stone the builders rejected is become the head of the corner; This was from Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] ; it is a marvel in our eyes’”.
Matthew,21,43,“Therefore I say to you the Kingdom of heaven will be torn from you and given to a nation producing fruit”.
Matthew,21,44,“He who falls upon this stone will be cast down; he who falls upon it will be broken apart.”
Matthew,21,45,The chief priests and the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] heard his parables and understood that he was speaking in regard to them.
Matthew,21,46,They sought to kill him but they feared the crowds to whom he was a Prophet.
Matthew,22,1,Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and spoke to them again in the words of a parable.
Matthew,22,2,“The Kingdom of heaven is like a king who made a wedding ceremony”
Matthew,22,3,"“He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the wedding ceremony, but they did not wish to come”."
Matthew,22,4,"“He again sent other servants saying: ‘Tell those who are invited, behold I have prepared a feast, I have killed oxen and fowl, and all is ready. Come to the wedding ceremony’”."
Matthew,22,5,"“But they scorned and went away, some into the city and some to their businesses”."
Matthew,22,6,"“Others took his servants, abused them, and killed them”."
Matthew,22,7,"“The king heard this, was angry, sent out his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burnt their house with fire”."
Matthew,22,8,"“Then he said to his servants: ‘The marriage ceremony is ready, but those who were invited were unworthy’”."
Matthew,22,9,"“Now, go out unto the roads and all whom you find invite to the marriage ceremony”."
Matthew,22,10,"“His servants went out unto the ways and assembled all those who were found, good and bad; so the marriage ceremony was filled with those who were eating”."
Matthew,22,11,“The king entered to see those who were eating and saw there a man who was not clothed in wedding garments”.
Matthew,22,12,“He said to him: ‘My friend how did you come in here without wedding garments?’ He was silent”.
Matthew,22,13,“Then the king said to his servants: ‘Bind his hands and feet and cast him to the lower most and lowest hell; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth’”.
Matthew,22,14,“Many are called but few are chosen.”
Matthew,22,15,Then the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] came and took counsel how to trap him in what he said.
Matthew,22,16,"They sent him some of their disciples, with violent men from Herod [heroic] saying: ‘Rabbi, we know that you are faithful, you faithfully study the way of Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] , you fear nothing, and are impartial’."
Matthew,22,17,‘Tell us your opinion: Is it right to give tribute to Caesar [venerable] or not?’
Matthew,22,18,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] recognized their deceit and said: “Why do you entice me, hypocrites?”"
Matthew,22,19,“Show me a tax coin”. They brought a plain one to him.
Matthew,22,20,He said to them: “Whose likeness is this and inscription?”
Matthew,22,21,They said: ‘Caesar [venerable] ’s’. Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to them: “Return to Caesar [venerable] that which is Caesar [venerable] ’s and to Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] that which is Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] ’s”.
Matthew,22,22,They heard and were amazed. They left him and went away.
Matthew,22,23,"On that day, the Tz’dukim (Sadducees) [followers of the right] and those who deny the resurrection of the dead met him. They asked him"
Matthew,22,24,"saying: ‘Rabbi, Moshe [drawn out] surely said to us: “When brothers dwell together and one of them dies and has no son, his brother should take his wife to raise up the seed of his brother”."
Matthew,22,25,"‘Behold there were seven brothers among us. The first one took a wife, died without seed and his brother married his wife’."
Matthew,22,26,‘Likewise the second and third unto the seventh’.
Matthew,22,27,‘After them the woman died’.
Matthew,22,28,"‘Since she had already belonged to all of them, to which of the seven will she be a wife, in the resurrection?’"
Matthew,22,29,Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said to them: “You err and do not understand the Writings or the power of The Mighty One”.
Matthew,22,30,"“In the day of resurrection, men will not take women nor women men, but they will be like the angels of Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] in heaven”."
Matthew,22,31,“Have you not read concerning the resurrection of the dead that Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] spoke to you saying”:
Matthew,22,32,"“I, Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] , am Elohe Avraham [the God of Exalted Father] , Elohe Yitz’chak [the God of Laughter] , and Elohe Ya’akov [the God if He who grabs onto the heal of] ”?. If so He is not Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] of the dead but Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] of the living”"
Matthew,22,33,The crowds heard and were amazed at his wisdom.
Matthew,22,34,"When the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] saw that the Tz’dukim (Sadducees) [followers of the right] had no answer, they gathered together."
Matthew,22,35,"Then a scribe asked him, tempting him:"
Matthew,22,36,"‘Rabbi, tell us which is the greatest commandment in the Torah?’"
Matthew,22,37,"He said to him: “Thou shalt love Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] your Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength”."
Matthew,22,38,“This is the first and great commandment.”
Matthew,22,39,“The second is like it: “Thou shalt love your neighbour as yourself”
Matthew,22,40,“Upon these two commandments the whole law hangs and the prophets”
Matthew,22,41,The P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] assembled and Yeshua [God is Salvation] asked them
Matthew,22,42,"saying: “What is your opinion concerning Ha-Moshiach [Messiah] [The Messiah] , whose son will he be? They said to him: ‘The son of David [Beloved] .’"
Matthew,22,43,"He said to them: “How is it that David [Beloved] by Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit [Ruach] ) called him saying ‘Adon [Lord - Kurios of the Earth]’”,;"
Matthew,22,44,“as it is written: “Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] said to my Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] sit at My right hand until I make your enemies your footstool”
Matthew,22,45,"“If David [Beloved] called him ‘Adon [Lord - Kurios of the Earth]’, how is he his son?”"
Matthew,22,46,They were not able to answer him a word and from then on they feared to ask him anything.
Matthew,23,1,Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] spoke to the people and to his disciples
Matthew,23,2,saying: “Upon the seat of Moshe [drawn out] the Torah-teachers (Scribes) and P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] sit”.
Matthew,23,3,"“Now all which he says to you keep and do; but according to their ordinances and deeds do not do, because they say and do not”."
Matthew,23,4,"“They demand and set forth great burdens which the shoulders of men are not able to bear; but they themselves, even with their finger, are unwilling to move”."
Matthew,23,5,"“All their actions they do for the sake of appearances; they wear expensive garments and large tassels”,"
Matthew,23,6,"“They love to recline first in the banquet halls, to be seated first at the synagogues”,"
Matthew,23,7,"“to prostrate themselves in the streets, and to be called Rabbi”."
Matthew,23,8,"“But as for you, do not desire to be called Teacher because One is your Teacher, and all of you are brothers”."
Matthew,23,9,“Call no man upon the earth ‘father’ because One is your Father Who is in heaven”.
Matthew,23,10,"“Do not be called Rabbi, because one is your Rabbi, Ha-Moshiach [Messiah] [The Messiah] ”."
Matthew,23,11,“The greatest among you will serve you”.
Matthew,23,12,“He who exalts himself will be humbled; he who humbles himself will be exalted”.
Matthew,23,13,"“Woe to you P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] and Torah-teachers (Scribes) , hypocrites because you close up the Kingdom of heaven before men; you yourselves do not enter and those who wish to enter you do not permit to enter”."
Matthew,23,14,"“Woe to you P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] and Torah-teachers (Scribes) , hypocrites, because you devour and divide the wealth of certain widows with lengthy exposition; for this you will suffer (allow, to let, permit) a long punishment”."
Matthew,23,15,“You encompass sea and land to bind the heart of one man to your faith and when he is bound he is doubly worse than before”.
Matthew,23,16,"“Woe to you council of the blind, who say that he who swears by the temple is not obligated, but he who vows by anything which is consecrated to the structure of the temple is not obligated to pay”,"
Matthew,23,17,"“-mad and blind men, which is greater, the temple or that which is consecrated to the temple?-”"

Matthew,23,19,"“Woe blind men, which is more, the gift or the altar, the temple or the gift?”"
Matthew,23,20,“He who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything which is in it”.
Matthew,23,21,“He who swears by the temple swears by the temple and He Who dwells within it”.
Matthew,23,22,“He who swears by the throne of Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] swears by it and by The One Who sits upon it”.
Matthew,23,23,"“Woe to them, Torah-teachers (Scribes) and P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] , who tithe mint, dill and pomegranate, but who commit robbery and leave undone that which is weightier, that is, the judgments of the Torah which are: kindness, tand faithfulness. These are commands worthy of doing; one should not forget them”."
Matthew,23,24,"“Offspring of blind leaders, who are strict in the matter of the gnat and swallow the camel”."
Matthew,23,25,"“Woe to you P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] and Torah-teachers (Scribes) , because you cleanse cups and platters on the outside but inside them is full of wickedness and uncleanness”."
Matthew,23,26,"“Hypocrites, cleanse first that which is inside in order that that which is outside might be pure”."
Matthew,23,27,"“Woe to you Torah-teachers (Scribes) and P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist]s) [separatists] , hypocrites, who are like whitened sepulchers which appear on the outside to be beautiful to men, but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and the filthy”."

Matthew,23,35,"“In order to place upon you the blood of every righteous one which has been poured out upon the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous unto the blood of Z’kharyah Ben-Berekhyah [Yah remembers, son of Yah blesses] whom you killed between the temple and the altar”."
Matthew,23,36,"“Truly I say to you that all these things will come upon this generation”,"
Matthew,23,37,“and upon Yerushalayim [abode of peace] who kills the prophets and removes those who are sent. How many times I wished to gather your children as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings and you would not”.
Matthew,23,38,“Therefore you will leave your houses desolate”.
Matthew,23,39,"“Truly, I say to you, you will not see me from now on, until you will say: ‘Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) is he who comes in the Name of Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate]’”."
Matthew,24,1,"It came to pass when Yeshua [God is Salvation] went out from the temple, as he was going, his disciples drew near to show him the buildings of the temple."
Matthew,24,2,He said: “You see all these; truly I say to you that all will be destroyed and there will not be left there one stone upon another”.
Matthew,24,3,"As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Kefa [pebble] , Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] and Andrew [of a man] asked him secretly: ‘When will these things be and what will be the sign when all these matters will take place, or when will they begin and when will be the end of the world and your coming?’"
Matthew,24,4,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered them: “Beware lest anyone should lead you astray”,"
Matthew,24,5,"“because many will come in my name saying: ‘I am the messiah, and they will lead many astray”."

Matthew,24,21,“Because there will be great distress which has not been from the creation of the world until now and as will not be”.
Matthew,24,22,"“Except those days were few, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the chosen those days will be few”."
Matthew,24,23,"“At that time, if one should say to you: ‘Look! the messiah is here’ or ‘there’ do not believe it”."
Matthew,24,24,"“Because false messiahs and false prophets will arise and they will give signs and great wonders so that, if possible, they will come to lead the chosen astray”."
Matthew,24,25,“Behold! I tell you before it happens”.
Matthew,24,26,"“Then if they should say to you: ‘Look! he is in the wilderness, do not go out, and; ‘Look! he is in the inner chamber’ do not believe it”."
Matthew,24,27,"Again Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “As the lightning comes from the east and is seen in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man”."
Matthew,24,28,"“Wherever the body is, there will be gathered the vultures”."
Matthew,24,29,"“At that time, after the tribulation of those days, the sun will grow dark, the moon will not give forth its light, the stars will fall from heaven, and the host of heaven will be shaken”."
Matthew,24,30,“Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven and all the families of the earth will weep and will see the Son of Man on the clouds of heaven with a great host and with dreadful appearance”.
Matthew,24,31,"“He will send his angels with a trumpet and with a great shout to gather his chosen from the four winds of heaven, from one end of heaven unto the other”."

Matthew,24,35,“Heaven and earth will pass away”.
Matthew,24,36,"“But of that day or that time, there is no one who knows, not even the angels of heaven, but the Father only”."
Matthew,24,37,Again Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “As in the days of Noah so will it be in the days of the Son of Man”.
Matthew,24,38,"“Just as before the flood, they were eating, drinking, being fruitful and multiplying until the day when Noah entered the ark”."
Matthew,24,39,“They did not know until the flood came upon them and destroyed them; so will be the coming of the Son of Man”.
Matthew,24,40,"“Then if there shall be two ploughing in a field, one righteous and the other ungodly, the one will be taken and the other left”."
Matthew,24,41,“Two women will be grinding at a mill; one will be taken and the other left. This is because the angels at the end of the world will remove the stumbling blocks from the world and will separate the righteous from the ungodly”.
Matthew,24,42,Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “Therefore watch with me because you do not know at what hour your Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] is coming”.
Matthew,24,43,"“This you know, if one knew at what hour the thief was coming, he would watch and not allow him to dig into his house”."
Matthew,24,44,"“So you should be prepared, because you do not know at what hour the Son of Man is going to come”."
Matthew,24,45,“What do you think of the faithful and wise slave whose Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] places over His children to give them food in its time?”.
Matthew,24,46,“Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) is that slave whose Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] finds him doing thus when He comes”.
Matthew,24,47,“Truly I say to you that He will place him over His children”.
Matthew,24,48,"“But if that slave should be evil and say in his heart: ‘My Adōn [Lord - Kurios of the earth] is late in coming’”,"
Matthew,24,49,"“and should begin to beat the slave of his Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] and should eat and drink with gluttons”,"
Matthew,24,50,“his Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] will come in a day for which he does not wait and at a time which he does not know”.
Matthew,24,51,“He will divide him and place his portion with the hypocrites; in that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth”.
Matthew,25,1,Again Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “The Kingdom of heaven is like ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet a bridegroom and a bride”.
Matthew,25,2,“Five of them were lazy fools and five of them were alert and wise”.
Matthew,25,3,"“The five foolish brought their lamps, but they brought no oil with them”."
Matthew,25,4,“The wise brought oil in their vessels with their lamps”.
Matthew,25,5,“The bridegroom was late and behold all of them lingered and slept”.
Matthew,25,6,“It came to pass at midnight that behold a voice was heard: ‘Behold the bridegroom is coming; come to meet him’”.
Matthew,25,7,“Then all those virgins came and trimmed their lamps”.
Matthew,25,8,“The foolish virgins said to the wise: ‘Give us some of your oil because our lamps have gone out’”.
Matthew,25,9,“The wise answered saying: ‘Go now to those who sell and buy for yourselves because there is not enough oil for us and you. We fear that it will be lacking for you’”.
Matthew,25,10,"“It came to pass when they went to buy, the Bridegroom came; those who were ready went with him into the marriage ceremony and the gate was closed”."
Matthew,25,11,"“Afterwards, the foolish came and called at the gate saying: ‘Our Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] open for us’”."
Matthew,25,12,"“He answered them: ‘Truly I say to you, I do not know who you are’”."
Matthew,25,13,"“Be careful, therefore, because you do not know the day nor the hour when the Bridegroom will come”."
Matthew,25,14,Again Yeshua [God is Salvation] told his disciples another example: “The Kingdom of heaven is like a man going on a far journey; he called his servants and dispersed to them his money”.
Matthew,25,15,"“To one he gave five coins of gold, to the second he gave two coins of gold and to the third one, to each he gave according to what was suitable for him. Then he went on his journey”."
Matthew,25,16,“The one who received five coins of gold went and gained five others”.
Matthew,25,17,"“Likewise the one who received two, went and gained two others”."
Matthew,25,18,"“But he who received the one went, dug in the earth, and hid the money of his Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] ”."
Matthew,25,19,“After many days the Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] of those servants came and sought from them an accounting of the money”.
Matthew,25,20,"“The one who received five coins of gold came near and said to him: My Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] , you gave me five coins of gold and behold, for you, are five others which I have gained”."
Matthew,25,21,"“His Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] said to him: ‘Truly you are a good and faithful slave. Because you have been faithful in a little, I will appoint you over much; enter into the joy of your Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth]’”."
Matthew,25,22,"“Also the one who received two coins of gold drew near and said: ‘My Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] , you gave me two coins of gold; here are two others which I have gained’”."
Matthew,25,23,"“His Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] said to him: ‘Truly you are a good and faithful slave. Because you have been faithful in a little, I will appoint you over much; enter into the joy of your Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth]’”."
Matthew,25,24,"“Then he who had received the one drew near and said: ‘My Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] , I know that you are firm and hard and that you reap what you did not sow and gather what you did not gather’."
Matthew,25,25,‘So in fear of you I went and hid your coin of gold and behold you have what is yours’”.
Matthew,25,26,"“His Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] answered and said: ‘Wicked and lazy slave, since you know that I reap what I did not sow and gather what I did not scatter’,"
Matthew,25,27,"‘therefore, you should have given my wealth to my money-changers so that at my coming I would have received what is mine with profit’”."
Matthew,25,28,"“Therefore, take from him the coin of gold and give it to the one who gained five coins of gold”."
Matthew,25,29,"“To the one who has it will be given, but to the one who does not have that which was intended for him will be taken from him”."
Matthew,25,30,"“As for the lazy slave, cast him into the darkness of the lowest places, in that place shall be for him weeping and gnashing of teeth”."
Matthew,25,31,"Again Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “When the Son of Man comes in his revelation with his angels, then he will sit upon the throne of his glory”."
Matthew,25,32,"“All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them as the shepherd separates the sheep and the goats”."
Matthew,25,33,“He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left”.
Matthew,25,34,“Then he will say to those on his right: ‘Enter Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) of my Father and inherit for yourselves the Kingdom of heaven prepared for you from the creation of the world until now’”.
Matthew,25,35,"“Because I was hungry and you gave me to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me to drink, I was a wayfarer and you took me in”,"
Matthew,25,36,"“naked and you clothed me, sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me”."
Matthew,25,37,"“Then the righteous will answer: ‘O our Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] , when did we see you hungry and satisfied you, thirsty and gave you to drink’”,"
Matthew,25,38,"‘a wayfarer and took you in, naked and clothed you’,"
Matthew,25,39,"‘sick and visited you, in prison and came to you?’"
Matthew,25,40,"“The King will answer and say to them: ‘Truly I say to you that every time you did it to one of the needy of these my brethren, even the little ones like these, you did it to me’”."
Matthew,25,41,"“Also he will say to those on his left: ‘Depart from me you cursed, and go into the everlasting fire, to the place prepared for you, with Satan [the adversary] and his angels’”,"
Matthew,25,42,"“because I was hungry and you did not give me to eat, I was thirsty and you did not give me to drink”,"
Matthew,25,43,"“I was a wayfarer and you did not take me in, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me”."
Matthew,25,44,"“Then they also will answer and say to him: ‘When did we see you O our Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] , hungry, thirsty or a wayfarer, naked, sick, or in prison and were not with you serving you?’”"
Matthew,25,45,“He will answer them and say: ‘I say to you whenever you did not do this to one of these needy; even the little ones like these; you did not do it to me’”.
Matthew,25,46,“Then these will go into everlasting abhorrence but the righteous into everlasting life”.
Matthew,26,1,"It came to pass when Yeshua [God is Salvation] finished speaking all these things, he said to his disciples:"
Matthew,26,2,“Do you not know that after two days will be the Pesakh (Seder) and the Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of the Yehudim [praise] to be crucified”.
Matthew,26,3,Then the rulers of the priests and the great ones of the people were gathered together in the court of the chief priest whose name was Kayafa [depression].
Matthew,26,4,They took counsel together to seize Yeshua [God is Salvation] by craftiness and to kill him.
Matthew,26,5,But they said it should not be at the feast lest there be a tumult among the people.
Matthew,26,6,"It came to pass when Yeshua [God is Salvation] was in Beit-Anyah [house of figs] in the house of Shim’on [he has heard] the leper,"
Matthew,26,7,a woman drew near to him with a flask of costly ointment; she poured it upon his head while he was reclining at table.
Matthew,26,8,But they said that this waste was very displeasing to them.
Matthew,26,9,‘It would have been possible to have sold it for a great price and to have given it to the poor’.
Matthew,26,10,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] who knows everything in regard to any matter done, said to them: “Are you making accusation against this woman? Truly she has performed a good and wonderful deed toward me”."
Matthew,26,11,"“Because the poor will be with you always, but I will not be with you always”."
Matthew,26,12,“Her placing this on my body refers to my burial”.
Matthew,26,13,"“Truly I say to you, everywhere this good news is proclaimed in all the world, that which she has done will be told in reference to my memory”."
Matthew,26,14,"Then one of the Twelve, whose name was Y’hudah [praised] K’riot [cities] went to the chief priests."
Matthew,26,15,He said: ‘What will you give me that I should deliver Yeshua [God is Salvation] over to you?’ They settled with him for thirty pieces of silver.
Matthew,26,16,From then on he sought a context for delivering him over.
Matthew,26,17,On the first day of the festival of unleavened bread the disciples came to Yeshua [God is Salvation] saying: ‘Where shall we prepare for you to eat the Pesakh (Seder)?’
Matthew,26,18,"He said to them: “Go into the city to a certain man who will be a volunteer for the task and say to him: ‘Thus says the Teacher (Rabbi) , my time is near; with you I will observe the Pesakh (Seder) with my disciples’”."
Matthew,26,19,The disciples did as Yeshua [God is Salvation] commanded them; and they prepared the Pesakh (Seder).
Matthew,26,20,"It came to pass at the time of evening, he was sitting at table with his twelve disciples."
Matthew,26,21,As they were eating he said to them: “I say to you that one of you will inform against me”.
Matthew,26,22,They were very sad and spoke each one to him saying: ‘Adon [Lord - Kurios of the Earth] is it I?’
Matthew,26,23,"He answered them: “He who dips his hand with me in the dish, will sell me”. All of them were eating from one dish. Therefore, they did not recognize him; because if they had recognized him they would have destroyed him."
Matthew,26,24,Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to them: “Truly the Son of Man goes as it is written concerning him; woe to that man for whose sake the Son of Man is betrayed. Good would it be for that man not to have been born”.
Matthew,26,25,"Y’hudah [praised] , who sold him, answered and said to him: ‘Rabbi am I this one?’. He said “You have said it”."
Matthew,26,26,"They were eating and Yeshua [God is Salvation] took bread, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) , divided it, gave it to his disciples and said: “Take and eat; this is my body”,"
Matthew,26,27,"He took the cup, gave praise to his Father, gave it to them, and said: “Drink from this, all of you”."
Matthew,26,28,“This is my blood of the new covenant which will be poured out for many for the atonement of sins”
Matthew,26,29,"“I say to you, I will not drink from this time forth (from now on) from this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the Kingdom of heaven”."
Matthew,26,30,And they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.
Matthew,26,31,"Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to his disciples: “Come, all of you, be offended because of me tonight because it is written: “Strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered”"
Matthew,26,32,"“After my resurrection from death, I will be revealed to you in Galil [circuit] ”."
Matthew,26,33,"Kefa [pebble] answered and said to him: ‘If all of them are offended because of you, I will never be offended’."
Matthew,26,34,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to him: “Truly I say to you, this night before the cock-crow you will deny me three times”."
Matthew,26,35,"Kefa [pebble] said to him: ‘If is arranged for me to die with you, I will not deny you’. Likewise all the disciples said to him."
Matthew,26,36,Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] came with them to the village of Gat-Sh’manim [Olive Press] and said: “Sit now here until I go there and pray”
Matthew,26,37,He took Kefa [pebble] and the two sons of Zavdai [Yah has bestowed] and began to be sad and troubled.
Matthew,26,38,Then he said to them: “My soul is grieved unto death; support me and watch with me”.
Matthew,26,39,"He slowly went forward a little, fell on his face, prayed and said: “My Father, if it is possible, take this cup from me. Indeed let it not be as I will, but according to Your will”."
Matthew,26,40,He came to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Kefa [pebble] “So you are unable to watch with me one hour?”
Matthew,26,41,"“Watch and pray lest you enter into temptation, because truly the Spirit [Ruach] is ready to go to its creator, but the flesh is weak and sick”."
Matthew,26,42,"He went again to pray saying: “My Father if You are not able to remove this cup except I should drink it, let it be done according to Your will”."
Matthew,26,43,Afterwards he returned and found them sleeping because their eyes were heavy.
Matthew,26,44,He left them and went to pray a third time according to the first words.
Matthew,26,45,Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] came to where the disciples were and said to them: “Sleep and be at rest; behold the time has come near when the Son of Man will be delivered into the hand of sinners”.
Matthew,26,46,"“Arise, let us go, for look! he who will betray me is near”."
Matthew,26,47,"While he was speaking, behold Y’hudah [praised] K’riot [cities] , one of his twelve disciples, came. With him was a large crowd with swords and whips sent from the chief priests and the princes of the people."
Matthew,26,48,He who betrayed him had given them a sign: ‘The man whom I kiss is the one whom you are to arrest’.
Matthew,26,49,Immediately he drew near to Yeshua [God is Salvation] and said to him: ‘Greetings Rabbi’; then he kissed him.
Matthew,26,50,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to him: “My friend, what have you done?” They came. stretched out their hand against him and arrested him."
Matthew,26,51,"Behold, one who was with Yeshua [God is Salvation] stretched out his hand, drew his sword, struck one of the servants of the priests, and cut off his ear."
Matthew,26,52,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to him: “Return your sword to its sheath, for all those who draw the sword will fall by the sword”."
Matthew,26,53,“Do you not understand that I can appeal to my Father and indeed there would be for me at once more than twelve legions of angels”.
Matthew,26,54,“But how will the Scripture be fulfilled? Because thus it is intended to be done”.
Matthew,26,55,"Afterwards Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to the crowd: “As if we were thieves, have you come to take me with swords and whips? Was I not with you every day in the temple teaching to you without you hindering me?”"
Matthew,26,56,“Surely all this was done because the writings of the Prophets were being fulfilled”. Then all his disciples left him and fled.
Matthew,26,57,"They led Yeshua [God is Salvation] to the house of Kayafa [depression] the high priest, where all the Torah-teachers (Scribes) and P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] were gathered together."
Matthew,26,58,Kefa [pebble] was following him at a distance unto the house of the high priest. He entered the house and sat near the craftsmen until he should see the end.
Matthew,26,59,The chief priests and the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] wished to find false witnesses against Yeshua [God is Salvation] in order to put him to death.
Matthew,26,60,"But they did not find even one, though they provided many false witnesses against Yeshua [God is Salvation] . Finally two false witnesses came forward."
Matthew,26,61,They said: ‘This one said I have the power to destroy the temple of The Most High and after three days to repair it’.
Matthew,26,62,The high priest arose and said to him: ‘Do you not answer anything against the testimony that these are bearing against you?’
Matthew,26,63,"But Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered not a word. The high priest said to him: ‘I adjure you by the Living Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] that you tell us if you are Ha-Moshiach [Messiah] [The Messiah] , the Son of The Mighty One?’"
Matthew,26,64,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered him: “You say it; but again I say to you, you have yet to see the Son of The Mighty One sitting at the right of the power of The Mighty One coming on the clouds of heaven”."
Matthew,26,65,Then the high priest tore his garments and said: ‘This one has cursed Elohim (The Many Powered) [The Living Word of God] . What need do we have for other witnesses? Behold all of you have heard how he cursed The Mighty One’.
Matthew,26,66,‘What do you think can be done?’ They answered: ‘He is guilty of death’.
Matthew,26,67,"Then they spat on his face and struck him on the back, and others slapped him in the face"
Matthew,26,68,"saying: ‘Tell us Moshiach [Messiah] , who struck you?’."
Matthew,26,69,"Kefa [pebble] was standing at the entrance of the courtyard, and there came near to him a maid who said to him: “Were you not also with Yeshua [God is Salvation] the Galilean?”"
Matthew,26,70,Kefa [pebble] lied to her before all and said to her: “Woman I do not know what you are saying”.
Matthew,26,71,When he passed through the gate another maid saw him and said to those who were standing there: ‘This man also was with Yeshua [God is Salvation] in Natzeret [separated] ’.
Matthew,26,72,Again he denied Yeshua [God is Salvation] with an oath that he did not know him.
Matthew,26,73,"After a little while, those who were standing in the courtyard drew near to Kefa [pebble] and said to him: ‘You are from this prophet’s group; it is clear from your speech you are one of them’."
Matthew,26,74,Then he began to deny and to swear that at no time had he known him. Immediately the cock crowed.
Matthew,26,75,"Kefa [pebble] remembered what Yeshua [God is Salvation] had said to him, that before the crowing of the cock he would deny him three times. Then he went outside and wept with bitterness of soul."
Matthew,27,1,It came to pass in the morning all the chief priests and elders took counsel against Yeshua [God is Salvation] that they should surely put him to death.
Matthew,27,2,They led him bound to the house of Pontius Pilate [armed with a spear] who was the governor.
Matthew,27,3,"When Y’hudah [praised] K’riot [cities] saw that he had been condemned, he began to turn in repentance. He returned the thirty dinars to the high priest and to the elders of the people."
Matthew,27,4,He said: ‘I have sinned because I have shed innocent blood’. But they said to him: ‘What is that to us? You see to it’.
Matthew,27,5,"He threw the coins into the temple, went and took a rope and hanged himself."
Matthew,27,6,When the chief priests received the coins they said: ‘It is not possible for us to place these coins in the temple because they are the fruit of blood since they were given for the blood of Yeshua [God is Salvation].
Matthew,27,7,"So they took counsel and gave them for a field of a certain potter of clay, that they might bury strangers there."
Matthew,27,8,Therefore that field is called the tent of blood unto this day.
Matthew,27,9,"Then was fulfilled the word of Zechariah the prophet: “And I said to them: ‘If it is good in your eyes, make out my wages, but if not, refrain (restrain; refrein from acting) . So they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver’. And Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] said unto me: “Cast it into the treasury, the goodly price that, that one, was valued by them’”. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them into the treasury, in the house of Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] ”."
Matthew,27,10,And they gave them for the potter’s field as Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] had commanded.
Matthew,27,11,Yeshua [God is Salvation] was standing before Pilate [armed with a spear] who asked him: ‘Are You the King of the Yehudim [praise] ?’ Yeshua [God is Salvation] said: “You say it.”
Matthew,27,12,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] was harassed by the chief priests and elders of the people in regard to some word which they spoke against him, he did not reply."
Matthew,27,13,Pilate [armed with a spear] said to Him: ‘Do You not see how much testimony there is against you?’
Matthew,27,14,But Yeshua [God is Salvation] did not answer him a word and Pilate [armed with a spear] was exceedingly amazed by this.
Matthew,27,15,"On the day of the honored feast of Pesakh (Seder) , it was their custom for the governor of the city to give to the people one of the prisoners whom they wished."
Matthew,27,16,"Pilate [armed with a spear] had a prisoner who was almost crazy: his name was Bar-Abba [son of a father] . Taken in a case of murder, he had placed him in the dungeon."
Matthew,27,17,"When they were gathered together Pilate [armed with a spear] said to them, ‘Which of these do you wish that I should release, Bar-Abba [son of a father] , or Yeshua [God is Salvation] who is called Moshiach [Messiah] ?’"
Matthew,27,18,This was because Pilate [armed with a spear] knew that due to hatred without cause he had been taken.
Matthew,27,19,"While he was sitting on the throne, his wife sent to him a messenger, saying: ‘I implore you that in no matter should you speak a word against this righteous man because in this night I have suffered many things in a vision because of Him.’"
Matthew,27,20,The chief priests and the elders of the law assembled the people that they might ask for Bar-Abba [son of a father] and that Yeshua [God is Salvation] might die.
Matthew,27,21,Pilate [armed with a spear] answered them: ‘Which of them do you wish that we should release.?’ They said: ‘Bar-Abba [son of a father] .’
Matthew,27,22,"Pilate [armed with a spear] said to them, ‘If so, what shall I do with Yeshua [God is Salvation] who is called Moshiach [Messiah] ?’ All of them answered that he should be crucified."
Matthew,27,23,"Pilate [armed with a spear] said to them: ‘What evil has He done?’ Then they vigorously cried out: ‘let them crucify him’, ‘let them crucify him’, ‘let them crucify him’."
Matthew,27,24,"Pilate [armed with a spear] , when he saw that he had no power of resistance, and was unable to make any peace with them, before a great dispute among the people might arise because of this, took water and washed his hands before the people and said: ‘I am innocent of this man’s blood. Be careful what you do.’"
Matthew,27,25,All the people answered and said: ‘His blood will be upon us and upon our seed’
Matthew,27,26,"Then he released Bar-Abba [son of a father] to them, and delivered to them Yeshua [God is Salvation] for beating and affliction and that they might crucify him."
Matthew,27,27,Then the horsemen of the court took Yeshua [God is Salvation] under guard and came together before a great company of many people.
Matthew,27,28,They clothed Yeshua [God is Salvation] with silk garments and covered him with a greenish silk robe.
Matthew,27,29,"The made a crown of thorns, and placed it on His head, and set a reed in his right hand and were bowing down mocking him: ‘Shalom be upon you King of the Yehudim [praise] .’"
Matthew,27,30,"They spat in His face, and took the reed and struck his head."
Matthew,27,31,"When they had deceived Him much, they stripped the robe from him, dressed him in his own clothes, and gave orders to crucify Him."
Matthew,27,32,"As they were going out from the city, they met a man whose name was Shim’on [he has heard] the Kenani [merchant] . The compelled him to carry the beam."
Matthew,27,33,"They came to a place called Gulgolta,"
Matthew,27,34,and gave Him wine mixed with gall (something bitter or poisonous) . But when he began to drink it he perceived what it was and would not drink it.
Matthew,27,35,When they placed him on the beam they divided his garments by lot.
Matthew,28,1,"On the first day of the week, early in the morning, Miryam [waters of strength] Magdala [a tower] and the other Miryam [waters of strength] came to see the tomb."
Matthew,28,2,"Then the earth shook because an angel of Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] descended from heaven to the tomb, overturned the stone and stood still."
Matthew,28,3,"His appearance was like the sun, and his garments like snow."
Matthew,28,4,From the fear of him the guards were dismayed and stood like dead men.
Matthew,28,5,The angel answered and said to the women: “Do not be afraid; for I know that you seek Yeshua [God is Salvation] who was crucified”.
Matthew,28,6,"“He is not here, for He is already alive, as He said. Come, therefore, and see the place where the Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] arose”."
Matthew,28,7,“Then go immediately and tell His disciples that the Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] has already risen there. He will go before you and there you will see Him as I have told you.”
Matthew,28,8,"The women went out of the tomb with fear because they had seen the angel, but with great joy because the Adon [Lord - Kurios of the earth] had come back to life. They ran to tell His disciples."
Matthew,28,9,"As they were going, Yeshua [God is Salvation] passed before them and said: “May Yehovah [Messiah Pre-Incarnate] deliver you”. They came near to him, bowed down to him, and did homage to him."
Matthew,28,10,"Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] said to them, “Do not be afraid; tell my brothers that they should go to Galil [circuit] , and there they will see Me.”"
Matthew,28,11,"While they were going, some of the guards entered the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened."
Matthew,28,12,"They came together for counsel with the elders of the people. Then they gave much money to the horsemen,"
Matthew,28,13,and said to them: ‘Say that his disciples came by night and stole Him while you were sleeping’.
Matthew,28,14,"‘If this should come to the ears of Pilate [armed with a spear] , we will tell him that he should leave you alone.’"
Matthew,28,15,They took the money and said thus as they had been instructed. This is the word in secret among the Yehudim [praise] unto this day.
Matthew,28,16,After this when his twelve disciples came to Galil [circuit] Yeshua [God is Salvation] appeared to them on the mountain where they had prayed.
Matthew,28,17,"When they saw Him, they did homage to him; but there were some of them who doubted him."
Matthew,28,18,Yeshua [God is Salvation] drew near to them and said to them: “All power has been given to Me in heaven and earth”.
Matthew,28,19,"“Go and make disciples, of all the nations, to believe in my name”"
Matthew,28,20,"“and teach them to observe all the words which I have commanded you, forever”."
