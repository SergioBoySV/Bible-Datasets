Luke,1,1,"Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,"
Luke,1,2,"Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;"
Luke,1,3,"It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto you i in order, most excellent Theophilus [friend of God],"
Luke,1,4,"That you i might know the certainty of those things, wherein you i have been instructed."
Luke,1,5,"There was in the days of Herod [heroic] , the king of Y’hudah [praised] , a certain priest named Z’kharyah [remembered by Yehovah] , of the course of Aviyah [Yah is my father] : and his wife [was] of the daughters of Aharon [Bright, Very High] , and her name [was] Elisheva [the oath of God]."
Luke,1,6,"And they were both righteous before God-Theos, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord - Kurios blameless."
Luke,1,7,"And they had no child, because that Elisheva [the oath of God] was barren, and they both were [now] well stricken in years."
Luke,1,8,"And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God-Theos in the order of his course,"
Luke,1,9,"According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord - Kurios."
Luke,1,10,And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.
Luke,1,11,And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord - Kurios standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
Luke,1,12,"And when Z’kharyah [remembered by Yehovah] saw [him] , he was troubled, and fear fell upon him."
Luke,1,13,"But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Z’kharyah [remembered by Yehovah] : for your i prayer is heard; and your i wife Elisheva [the oath of God] shall bear you i a son, and you i shall call his name Yochanan [Yehovah has graced]."
Luke,1,14,And you i shall have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.
Luke,1,15,"For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord - Kurios, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] , even from his mother’s womb."
Luke,1,16,And many of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] shall he turn to the Lord - Kurios their God-Theos.
Luke,1,17,"And he shall go before him in the Spirit [Ruach] and power of Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] , to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord - Kurios."
Luke,1,18,"And Z’kharyah [remembered by Yehovah] said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years."
Luke,1,19,"And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God-Theos; and am sent to speak unto you i , and to show you i these glad tidings."
Luke,1,20,"And, behold, you i shall be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because you i believe not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season."
Luke,1,21,"And the people waited for Z’kharyah [remembered by Yehovah] , and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple."
Luke,1,22,"And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless."
Luke,1,23,"And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration (service; ministry) were accomplished, he departed to his own house."
Luke,1,24,"And after those days his wife Elisheva [the oath of God] conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,"
Luke,1,25,"Thus has the Lord - Kurios dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on [me] , to take away my reproach (disgrace; shame) among men."
Luke,1,26,"And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God-Theos unto a city of Galil [circuit, district] , named Natzeret [one separated],"
Luke,1,27,"To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Yosef [God will add] , of the house of David [Beloved] ; and the virgin’s name [was] Miryam [waters of strength]."
Luke,1,28,"And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, [you i that are] highly favoured, the Lord - Kurios [is] with you i : Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [are] you i among women."
Luke,1,29,"And when she saw [him] , she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of Greeting this should be."
Luke,1,30,"And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Miryam [waters of strength] : for you i have found favour with God-Theos."
Luke,1,31,"And, behold, you i shall conceive in your i womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name YESHUA (GOD SAVES)."
Luke,1,32,"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord - Kurios God-Theos shall give unto him the throne of his father David [Beloved]:"
Luke,1,33,And he shall reign over the house of Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] [Heal of God] forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
Luke,1,34,"Then said Miryam [waters of strength] unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"
Luke,1,35,"And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] shall come upon you i , and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you i : therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of you i shall be called the Son of God-Theos."
Luke,1,36,"And, behold, your i cousin Elisheva [the oath of God] , she has also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren."
Luke,1,37,For with God-Theos nothing shall be impossible.
Luke,1,38,"And Miryam [waters of strength] said, Behold the female slave of the Lord - Kurios; be it unto me according to your i word. And the angel departed from her."
Luke,1,39,"And Miryam [waters of strength] arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Y’hudah [praised];"
Luke,1,40,"And entered into the house of Z’kharyah [remembered by Yehovah] , and saluted Elisheva [the oath of God]."
Luke,1,41,"And it came to pass, that, when Elisheva [the oath of God] heard the Greeting of Miryam [waters of strength] , the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisheva [the oath of God] was filled with the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh]:"
Luke,1,42,"And she spoke out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [are] you i among women, and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [is] the fruit of your i womb."
Luke,1,43,"And from what place [is] this to me, that the mother of my Lord - Kurios should come to me?"
Luke,1,44,"For, lo, as soon as the voice of your i Greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy."
Luke,1,45,And Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [is] she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord - Kurios.
Luke,1,46,"And Miryam [waters of strength] said, My soul does magnify the Lord - Kurios,"
Luke,1,47,And my Spirit [Ruach] has rejoiced in God-Theos my Saviour.
Luke,1,48,"For he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from from this time forth (from now on) all generations shall call me Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)."
Luke,1,49,For he that is mighty has done to me great things; and holy [is] his name.
Luke,1,50,And his mercy [is] on them that fear him from generation to generation.
Luke,1,51,He has showed strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
Luke,1,52,"He has put down the mighty from [their] seats, and exalted them of low degree."
Luke,1,53,He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he has sent empty away.
Luke,1,54,"He has helped his slave Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] , in remembrance of [his] mercy;"
Luke,1,55,"As he spoke to our fathers, to Avraham [Exalted Father] , and to his seed forever."
Luke,1,56,"And Miryam [waters of strength] abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house."
Luke,1,57,Now Elisheva [the oath of God] ’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.
Luke,1,58,And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord - Kurios had showed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.
Luke,1,59,"And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Z’kharyah [remembered by Yehovah] , after the name of his father."
Luke,1,60,"And his mother answered and said, Not [so] ; but he shall be called Yochanan [Yehovah has graced]."
Luke,1,61,"And they said unto her, There is none of your i family that is called by this name."
Luke,1,62,"And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called."
Luke,1,63,"And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] . And they marvelled all."
Luke,1,64,"And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue [loosed] , and he spoke, and praised God-Theos."
Luke,1,65,And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Y’hudah [praised].
Luke,1,66,"And all they that heard [them] laid [them] up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord - Kurios was with him."
Luke,1,67,"And his father Z’kharyah [remembered by Yehovah] was filled with the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] , and prophesied, saying,"
Luke,1,68,"Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the Lord - Kurios God-Theos of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] ; for he has visited and redeemed his people,"
Luke,1,69,And has raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his slave David [Beloved];
Luke,1,70,"As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:"
Luke,1,71,"That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;"
Luke,1,72,"To finish the mercy [promised] to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;"
Luke,1,73,"The oath which he swore to our father Avraham [Exalted Father],"
Luke,1,74,"That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,"
Luke,1,75,"In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life."
Luke,1,76,"And your i , child, shall be called the prophet of the Highest: for you i shall go before the face of the Lord - Kurios to prepare his ways;"
Luke,1,77,"To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the forgiveness (pardon) of their sins,"
Luke,1,78,"Through the tender mercy of our God-Theos; whereby the Dayspring (sunrise) from on high has visited us,"
Luke,1,79,"To give light to them that sit in darkness and [in] the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace."
Luke,1,80,"And the child grew, and waxed strong in Spirit [Ruach] , and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God]."
Luke,2,1,"And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar [venerable] Augustus, that all the world should be taxed."
Luke,2,2, [And] this taxing was first made when Quirinius [warrior] was governor of Aram [exalted] (Syria [etymology is uncertain])
Luke,2,3,"And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city."
Luke,2,4,"And Yosef [God will add] also went up from Galil [circuit, district] , out of the city of Natzeret [one separated] , into Y’hudah [praised] , unto the city of David [Beloved] , which is called Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] ; (because he was of the house and lineage of David [Beloved])"
Luke,2,5,"To be taxed with Miryam [waters of strength] his espoused wife, being great with child."
Luke,2,6,"And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered."
Luke,2,7,"And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes (cloths for wrapping infants tightly) , and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn."
Luke,2,8,"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night."
Luke,2,9,"And, lo, the angel of the Lord - Kurios came upon them, and the glory of the Lord - Kurios shone round about them: and they were sore afraid."
Luke,2,10,"And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people."
Luke,2,11,"For unto you is born this day in the city of David [Beloved] a Saviour, which is Moshiach [Messiah] the Lord - Kurios."
Luke,2,12,"And this [shall be] a sign unto you; You 2f shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes (cloths for wrapping infants tightly) , lying in a manger."
Luke,2,13,"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God-Theos, and saying,"
Luke,2,14,"Glory to God-Theos in the highest, and on earth peace among men of God’s good pleasure or choosing.."
Luke,2,15,"And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Beit-Lechem [House of Bread] , and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord - Kurios has made known unto us."
Luke,2,16,"And they came with haste, and found Miryam [waters of strength] , and Yosef [God will add] , and the babe lying in a manger."
Luke,2,17,"And when they had seen [it] , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child."
Luke,2,18,And all they that heard [it] wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
Luke,2,19,"But Miryam [waters of strength] kept all these things, and pondered [them] in her heart."
Luke,2,20,"And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God-Theos for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them."
Luke,2,21,"And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called YESHUA (GOD SAVES) , which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb."
Luke,2,22,"And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] were accomplished, they brought him to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , to present [him] to the Lord - Kurios;"
Luke,2,23,"(As it is written in the law of the Lord - Kurios, Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord - Kurios;)"
Luke,2,24,"And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord - Kurios, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons."
Luke,2,25,"And, behold, there was a man in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , whose name [was] Shim’on [he who hears] ; and the same man [was] just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] : and the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] was upon him."
Luke,2,26,"And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] , that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord - Kurios’s Moshiach [Messiah]."
Luke,2,27,"And he came by the Spirit [Ruach] into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Yeshua [God is Salvation] , to do for him after the custom of the law,"
Luke,2,28,"Then took he him up in his arms, and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) God-Theos, and said,"
Luke,2,29,"Lord - Kurios, now let you i your i slave depart in peace, according to your i word:"
Luke,2,30,"For my eyes have seen your i Salvation,"
Luke,2,31,Which you i have prepared before the face of all people;
Luke,2,32,"A light to lighten the Goyim [Gentiles] , and the glory of your i people Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God]."
Luke,2,33,And Yosef [God will add] and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.
Luke,2,34,"And Shim’on [he who hears] Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) them, and said unto Miryam [waters of strength] his mother, Behold, this [child] is set for the fall and rising again of many in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] ; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;"
Luke,2,35,"(Yes, a sword shall pierce through your i own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."
Luke,2,36,"And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the Bat-P’nu’el [daugher of the face of God] , of the tribe of Asher [Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)]: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;"
Luke,2,37,"And she [was] a widow of about eighty and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served [God-Theos] with fastings and prayers night and day."
Luke,2,38,"And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord - Kurios, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Luke,2,39,"And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord - Kurios, they returned into Galil [circuit, district] , to their own city Natzeret [one separated]."
Luke,2,40,"And the child grew, and waxed strong in Spirit [Ruach] , filled with wisdom: and the grace of God-Theos was upon him."
Luke,2,41,Now his parents went to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] every year at the feast of the Passover.
Luke,2,42,"And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] after the custom of the feast."
Luke,2,43,"And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Yeshua [God is Salvation] tarried behind in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; and Yosef [God will add] and his mother knew not [of it]."
Luke,2,44,"But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s journey; and they sought him among [their] kinsfolk and acquaintance."
Luke,2,45,"And when they found him not, they turned back again to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , seeking him."
Luke,2,46,"And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions."
Luke,2,47,And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.
Luke,2,48,"And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why have you i thus dealt with us? behold, your i father and I have sought you i sorrowing."
Luke,2,49,"And he said unto them, How is it that you 2f sought me? did not know you 2f not that I must be about my Father’s business?"
Luke,2,50,And they understood not the saying which he spoke unto them.
Luke,2,51,"And he went down with them, and came to Natzeret [one separated] , and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart."
Luke,2,52,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God-Theos and man."
Luke,3,1,"Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius [as god-river] Caesar [venerable] , Pontius Pilate [armed with a spear] being governor of Y’hudah [praised] , and Herod [heroic] being tetrarch of Galil [circuit, district] , and his brother Philip [friend of horses] tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis [a rugged region] , and Lysanias [that drives away sorrow] the tetrarch of Abilene [grassy meadow],"
Luke,3,2,"‘Anan [humble] and Kayafa [depression] being the high priests, the word of God-Theos came unto Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the son of Z’kharyah [remembered by Yehovah] in the wilderness."
Luke,3,3,"And he came into all the country about Yarden [descender] , preaching the baptism of repentance for the forgiveness (pardon) of sins;"
Luke,3,4,"As it is written in the book of the words of Yesha’yahu [Yah is salvation] the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you 2f the way of the Lord - Kurios, make his paths straight."
Luke,3,5,"Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways [shall be] made smooth;"
Luke,3,6,And all flesh shall see the salvation of God-Theos.
Luke,3,7,"Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Luke,3,8,"Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Avraham [Exalted Father] to [our] father: for I say unto you, That God-Theos is able of these stones to raise up children unto Avraham [Exalted Father]."
Luke,3,9,"And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which brings not forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire."
Luke,3,10,"And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?"
Luke,3,11,"He answer and says unto them, He that has two coats, let him impart to him that has none; and he that has meat, let him do likewise."

Luke,3,15,"And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , whether he were the Moshiach [Messiah] , or not;"
Luke,3,16,"Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] answered, saying unto [them] all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I comes, the sandal lace of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] and with fire:"
Luke,3,17,"Whose fan (a fork-shaped tool to throw grain in the air, to let he wind separate the wheat from the chaff) [is] in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."
Luke,3,18,And many other things in his Exhortation (encouragement; counsel) preached he unto the people.
Luke,3,19,"But Herod [heroic] the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip [friend of horses] ’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod [heroic] had done,"
Luke,3,20,"Added yet this above all, that he shut up Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] in prison."
Luke,3,21,"Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Yeshua [God is Salvation] also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,"

Luke,4,6,"And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give you i , and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it."
Luke,4,7,"If you i therefore will worship me, all shall be you i."
Luke,4,8,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto him, Get you i behind me, Satan [the adversary] : for it is written, you i shall worship the Lord - Kurios you i God-Theos, and him only shall you i serve."
Luke,4,9,"And he brought him to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If you i be the Son of God-Theos, cast yourself down from hence:"
Luke,4,10,"For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over you i , to keep you i:"
Luke,4,11,"And in [their] hands they shall bear you i up, lest at any time you i dash your i foot against a stone."
Luke,4,12,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering said unto him, It is said, you i shall not tempt the Lord - Kurios-Yehovah your i God-Theos."
Luke,4,13,"And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season."
Luke,4,14,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] returned in the power of the Spirit [Ruach] into Galil [circuit, district] : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about."
Luke,4,15,"And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all."
Luke,4,16,"And he came to Natzeret [one separated] , where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Shabbat [rest] day, and stood up for to read."
Luke,4,17,"And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Yesha’yahu [Yah is salvation] . And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,"
Luke,4,18,"The Spirit [Ruach] of the Lord - Kurios-Yehovah [is] upon me, because he has anointed me to preach the Gospel (joyful message) to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,"
Luke,4,19,To preach the acceptable year of the Lord - Kurios-Yehovah.
Luke,4,20,"And he closed the book, and he gave [it] again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him."
Luke,4,21,"And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears."
Luke,4,22,"And all bore him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Yosef [God will add] ’s son?"
Luke,4,23,"And he said unto them, You 2f will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal yourself: whatsoever we have heard done in K’far-Nachum [town of comfort] , do also here in your i country."
Luke,4,24,"And he said, Truly I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country."
Luke,4,25,"But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] in the days of Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;"
Luke,4,26,"But unto none of them was Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] sent, save unto Sarepta, [a city] of Tzidon [hunting] , unto a woman [that was] a widow."
Luke,4,27,"And many lepers were in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Na’aman [Pleasantness] the Arami [exalted]."
Luke,4,28,"And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,"
Luke,4,29,"And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong."
Luke,4,30,"But he passing through the midst of them went his way,"
Luke,4,31,"And came down to K’far-Nachum [town of comfort] , a city of Galil [circuit, district] , and taught them on the Shabbat [rest] days."
Luke,4,32,And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.
Luke,4,33,"And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a Spirit [Ruach] of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,"
Luke,4,34,"Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with you i, [you i ] Yeshua [God is Salvation] of Natzeret [one separated] ? are you i come to destroy us? I know you i who you i are; the Holy One of God! [The Father]."
Luke,4,35,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] rebuked him, saying, Hold your i peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not."
Luke,4,36,"And they were all amazed, and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word [is] this! for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out."
Luke,4,37,And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.
Luke,4,38,"And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Shim’on [he has heard] ’s house. And Shim’on [he has heard] ’s wife’s mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her."
Luke,4,39,"And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them."
Luke,4,40,"Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with different diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them."
Luke,4,41,"And demons also came out of many, crying out, and saying, you i are Moshiach [Messiah] the Son of God-Theos. And he rebuking [them] suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Moshiach [Messiah]."
Luke,4,42,"And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and detained (held) him, that he should not depart from them."
Luke,4,43,"And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God-Theos to other cities also: for therefore am I sent."
Luke,4,44,"And he preached in the synagogues of Galil [circuit, district]."
Luke,5,1,"And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God-Theos, he stood by the lake of Kinneret [a harp],"
Luke,5,2,"And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing [their] nets."
Luke,5,3,"And he entered into one of the ships, which was Shim’on [he has heard] ’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship."
Luke,5,4,"Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Shim’on [he has heard] , Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught."
Luke,5,5,"And Shim’on [he has heard] answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at your i word I will let down the net."
Luke,5,6,"And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net broke."
Luke,5,7,"And they beckoned unto [their] partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink."
Luke,5,8,"When Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] saw [it] , he fell down at Yeshua [God is Salvation] ’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord - Kurios."
Luke,5,9,"For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:"
Luke,5,10,"And so [was] also Ya’akov [heal-grabber] , and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , the sons of Zavdai [Yah has bestowed] , which were partners with Shim’on [he has heard] . And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto Shim’on [he has heard] , Fear not; from from this time forth (from now on) you i shall catch men."
Luke,5,11,"And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him."
Luke,5,12,"And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Yeshua [God is Salvation] fell on [his] face, and besought him, saying, Lord - Kurios, if you i will, you i can make me clean."
Luke,5,13,"And he put forth [his] hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be you i clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him."
Luke,5,14,"And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your i cleansing, according as Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] commanded, for a testimony unto them."
Luke,5,15,"But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities."
Luke,5,16,"And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed."
Luke,5,17,"And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galil [circuit, district] , and Y’hudah [praised] , and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : and the power of the Lord - Kurios was [present] to heal them."
Luke,5,18,"And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought [means] to bring him in, and to lay [him] before him."
Luke,5,19,"And when they could not find by what [way] they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with [his] couch into the midst before Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
Luke,5,20,"And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, your i sins are forgiven you i."
Luke,5,21,"And the Torah-teachers (Scribes) and the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God-Theos alone?"
Luke,5,22,"But when Yeshua [God is Salvation] perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason you 2f in your hearts?"
Luke,5,23,"Whether is easier, to say, You 1s sins be forgiven you i ; or to say, Rise up and walk?"
Luke,5,24,"But that you 2f may know that the Son of Man has power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto you i , Arise, and take up your i couch, and go into your i house."
Luke,5,25,"And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God-Theos."
Luke,5,26,"And they were all amazed, and they glorified God-Theos, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day."
Luke,5,27,"And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican (tax collector) , named Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] , sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me."
Luke,5,28,"And he left all, rose up, and followed him."
Luke,5,29,"And Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them."
Luke,5,30,"But their Torah-teachers (Scribes) and P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you 2f eat and drink with publicans and sinners?"
Luke,5,31,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick."
Luke,5,32,"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
Luke,5,33,"And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] fast often, and make prayers, and likewise [the disciples] of the P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] ; but you i eat and drink?"
Luke,5,34,"And he said unto them, Can you 2f make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?"
Luke,5,35,"But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days."
Luke,5,36,"And he spoke also a parable unto them; No man puts a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new makes a rent, and the piece that was [taken] out of the new agree not with the old."
Luke,5,37,"And no man puts New Wine into old bottles; else the New Wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish."
Luke,5,38,But New Wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.
Luke,5,39,"No man also having drunk old [wine] immediately desires new: for he says, The old is better."
Luke,6,1,"And it came to pass on the second Shabbat [rest] after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing [them] in [their] hands."
Luke,6,2,"And certain of the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] said unto them, Why do you 2f that which is not lawful to do on the Shabbat [rest] days?"
Luke,6,3,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering them said, Have you 2f not read so much as this, what David [Beloved] did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;"
Luke,6,4,"How he went into the house of God-Theos, and did take and eat the showbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?"
Luke,6,5,"And he said unto them, That the Son of Man is Lord - Kurios also of the Shabbat [rest]."
Luke,6,6,"And it came to pass also on another Shabbat [rest] , that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered."
Luke,6,7,"And the Torah-teachers (Scribes) and P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] watched him, whether he would heal on the Shabbat [rest] day; that they might find an accusation against him."
Luke,6,8,"But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth."
Luke,6,9,"Then said Yeshua [God is Salvation] unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the Shabbat [rest] days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy [it]?"
Luke,6,10,"And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth your i hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other."
Luke,6,11,And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Yeshua [God is Salvation].
Luke,6,12,"And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God-Theos."
Luke,6,13,"And when it was day, he called [unto him] his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;"
Luke,6,14,"Shim’on [he has heard] , (whom he also named Kefa [pebble] ,) and Andrew [of a man] his brother, Ya’akov [heal-grabber] and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , Philip [friend of horses] and Bartholomew,"
Luke,6,15,"Mattityahu [gift of Yah] and T’oma [twin] , Ya’akov [heal-grabber] the [son] of Bar-Halfai [son of “changing”] , and Shim’on [he has heard] called Zelotes,"
Luke,6,16,"And Y’hudah [praised] [the brother] of Ya’akov [heal-grabber] , and Y’hudah [praised] From K’riot [cities] , which also was the traitor."
Luke,6,17,"And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Y’hudah [praised] and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and from the sea coast of Tzor [a rock] and Tzidon [hunting] , which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;"
Luke,6,18,And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.
Luke,6,19,"And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue (power) out of him, and healed [them] all."
Luke,6,20,"And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be you 2f ] poor: for yours is the kingdom of God-Theos."
Luke,6,21,Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [are you 2f ] that hunger now: for you 2f shall be filled. Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [are you 2f ] that weep now: for you 2f shall laugh.
Luke,6,22,"Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) are you 2f , when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you [from their company] , and shall reproach (disgrace; shame) [you] , and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake."
Luke,6,23,"Rejoice you 2f in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward [is] great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets."
Luke,6,24,But woe unto you that are rich! for you 2f have received your consolation.
Luke,6,25,Woe unto you that are full! for you 2f shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for you 2f shall mourn and weep.
Luke,6,26,"Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets."
Luke,6,27,"But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,"
Luke,6,28,"Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you."
Luke,6,29,And unto him that smites you i on the [one] cheek offer also the other; and him that takes away your i cloak forbid not [to take your i ] coat also.
Luke,6,30,Give to every man that asks of you i ; and of him that takes away your i goods ask [them] not again.
Luke,6,31,"And as you 2f would that men should do to you, do you 2f also to them likewise."
Luke,6,32,"For if you 2f love them which love you, what thank have you 2f ? for sinners also love those that love them."
Luke,6,33,"And if you 2f do good to them which do good to you, what thank have you 2f ? for sinners also do even the same."
Luke,6,34,"And if you 2f lend [to them] of whom you 2f hope to receive, what thank have you 2f ? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again."
Luke,6,35,"But love you 2f your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and you 2f shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and [to] the evil."
Luke,6,36,"Be you 2f therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful."
Luke,6,37,"Judge not, and you 2f shall not be judged: condemn not, and you 2f shall not be condemned: forgive, and you 2f shall be forgiven:"
Luke,6,38,"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you 2f measure (deal out) withal it shall be measured to you again."
Luke,6,39,"And he spoke a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?"
Luke,6,40,The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.
Luke,6,41,"And why behold you i the splinter that is in your i brother’s eye, but perceive not the beam that is in your i own eye?"
Luke,6,42,"Either how can you i say to your i brother, Brother, let me pull out the splinter that is in your i eye, when you i yourself behold not the beam that is in your i own eye? you i hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of your i own eye, and then shall you i see clearly to pull out the splinter that is in your i brother’s eye."
Luke,6,43,For a good tree brings not forth corrupt fruit; neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
Luke,6,44,"For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes."
Luke,6,45,A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.
Luke,6,46,"And why call you 2f me, Lord - Kurios-Adon, Lord - Kurios-Adon, and do not the things which I say?"
Luke,6,47,"Whosoever comes to me, and hears my sayings, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like:"
Luke,6,48,"He is like a man which built an house, and excavated deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock."
Luke,6,49,"But he that hears, and does not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great."
Luke,7,1,"Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into K’far-Nachum [town of comfort]."
Luke,7,2,"And a certain Centurion (Roman commander of an hundred men)’s slave, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die."
Luke,7,3,"And when he heard of Yeshua [God is Salvation] , he sent unto him the elders of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , beseeching him that he would come and heal his slave."
Luke,7,4,"And when they came to Yeshua [God is Salvation] , they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:"
Luke,7,5,"For he loves our nation, and he has built us a synagogue."
Luke,7,6,"Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the Centurion (Roman commander of an hundred men) sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord - Kurios, trouble not yourself: for I am not worthy that you i should enter under my roof:"
Luke,7,7,"For what reason neither thought I myself worthy to come unto you i : but say in a word, and my slave shall be healed."
Luke,7,8,"For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does [it]."
Luke,7,9,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God]."
Luke,7,10,"And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the slave whole that had been sick."
Luke,7,11,"And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people."
Luke,7,12,"Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her."
Luke,7,13,"And when the Lord - Kurios saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not."
Luke,7,14,"And he came and touched the bier: and they that bore [him] stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto you i , Arise."
Luke,7,15,"And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother."
Luke,7,16,"And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God-Theos, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God-Theos has visited his people."
Luke,7,17,"And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Y’hudah [praised] , and throughout all the region round about."
Luke,7,18,And the disciples of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] showed him of all these things.
Luke,7,19,"And Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] calling [unto him] two of his disciples sent [them] to Yeshua [God is Salvation] , saying, Are you i he that should come? or look we for another?"
Luke,7,20,"When the men were come unto him, they said, Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the Baptizer has sent us unto you i , saying, Are you i he that should come? or look we for another?"
Luke,7,21,"And in that same hour he cured many of [their] infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many [that were] blind he gave sight."
Luke,7,22,"Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] what things you 2f have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the Gospel (joyful message) is preached."
Luke,7,23,"And Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) is [he] , whosoever shall not be offended in me."
Luke,7,24,"And when the messengers of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , What went you 2f out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?"
Luke,7,25,"But what went you 2f out for to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts."
Luke,7,26,"But what went you 2f out for to see? A prophet? Yes, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet."
Luke,7,27,"This is [he] , of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before your i face, which shall prepare your i way before you i."
Luke,7,28,"For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God-Theos is greater than he."
Luke,7,29,"And all the people that heard [him] , and the publicans, justified God-Theos, being baptized with the baptism of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced]."
Luke,7,30,"But the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] and lawyers rejected the counsel of God-Theos against themselves, being not baptized of him."
Luke,7,31,"And the Lord - Kurios said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?"
Luke,7,32,"They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and you 2f have not danced; we have mourned to you, and you 2f have not wept."
Luke,7,33,"For Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and you 2f say, He has a devil."
Luke,7,34,"The Son of Man is come eating and drinking; and you 2f say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!"
Luke,7,35,But wisdom is justified of all her children.
Luke,7,36,"And one of the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee [separatist] ’s house, and sat down to meat."
Luke,7,37,"And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that [Yeshua [God is Salvation] ] sat at meat in the Pharisee [separatist] ’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,"
Luke,7,38,"And stood at his feet behind [him] weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe [them] with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed [them] with the ointment."
Luke,7,39,"Now when the Pharisee [separatist] which had bidden him saw [it] , he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman [this is] that touches him: for she is a sinner."
Luke,7,40,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering said unto him, Shim’on [he has heard] , I have somewhat to say unto you i . And he says, Master, say on."
Luke,7,41,"There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty."
Luke,7,42,"And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?"
Luke,7,43,"Shim’on [he has heard] answered and said, I suppose that [he] , to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, you i have rightly judged."
Luke,7,44,"And he turned to the woman, and said unto Shim’on [he has heard] , See you i this woman? I entered into your i house, you i gave me no water for my feet: but she has washed my feet with tears, and wiped [them] with the hairs of her head."
Luke,7,45,you i gave me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in has not ceased to kiss my feet.
Luke,7,46,My head with oil you i did not anoint: but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment.
Luke,7,47,"For what reason I say unto you i , Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, [the same] loves little."
Luke,7,48,"And he said unto her, You 1s sins are forgiven."
Luke,7,49,"And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?"
Luke,7,50,"And he said to the woman, You 1s faith has saved you i ; go in peace."
Luke,8,1,"And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God-Theos: and the twelve [were] with him,"
Luke,8,2,"And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Miryam [waters of strength] called Magdala [a tower] , out of whom went seven demons,"
Luke,8,3,"And Yochanan [gift of God] the wife of Kuza [the seer] Herod [heroic] ’s steward, and Shoshanah [a lily] , and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance."
Luke,8,4,"And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable:"
Luke,8,5,"A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trampled down, and the fowls of the air devoured it."
Luke,8,6,"And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture."
Luke,8,7,"And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it."
Luke,8,8,"And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bore fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that has ears to hear, let him hear."
Luke,8,9,"And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?"
Luke,8,10,"And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God-Theos: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand."
Luke,8,11,Now the parable is this: The seed is the Word of God-The Father.
Luke,8,12,"Those by the way side are they that hear; then comes the devil, and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved."
Luke,8,13,"They on the rock [are they] , which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away."
Luke,8,14,"And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of [this] life, and bring no fruit to perfection."
Luke,8,15,"But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep [it] , and bring forth fruit with patience."
Luke,8,16,"No man, when he has lighted a candle, covers it with a vessel, or puts [it] under a bed; but sets [it] on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light."
Luke,8,17,"For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither [any thing] hid, that shall not be known and come abroad."
Luke,8,18,"Take heed therefore how you 2f hear: for whosoever has, to him shall be given; and whosoever has not, from him shall be taken even that which he seems to have."
Luke,8,19,"Then came to him [his] mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press."
Luke,8,20,"And it was told him [by certain] which said, your i mother and your i brethren stand without, desiring to see you i."
Luke,8,21,"And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the Word of God-The Father, and do it."
Luke,8,22,"Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth."
Luke,8,23,"But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled [with water] , and were in jeopardy."
Luke,8,24,"And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm."
Luke,8,25,"And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commands even the winds and water, and they obey him."
Luke,8,26,"And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes’ [those who come from pilgrimage or fight] , which is over against Galil [circuit, district]."
Luke,8,27,"And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had demons long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in [any] house, but in the tombs."
Luke,8,28,"When he saw Yeshua [God is Salvation] , he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with you i , Yeshua [God is Salvation], [you i ] Son of God-Theos most high? I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , torment me not."
Luke,8,29,"(For he had commanded the unclean Spirit [Ruach] to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he broke the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)"
Luke,8,30,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] asked him, saying, What is your i name? And he said, Legion: because many demons were entered into him."
Luke,8,31,And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.
Luke,8,32,"And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer (allow, to let, permit) them to enter into them. And he suffered them."
Luke,8,33,"Then went the demons out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked."
Luke,8,34,"When they that fed [them] saw what was done, they fled, and went and told [it] in the city and in the country."
Luke,8,35,"Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and found the man, out of whom the demons were departed, sitting at the feet of Yeshua [God is Salvation] , clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid."
Luke,8,36,They also which saw [it] told them by what means he that was possessed of the demons was healed.
Luke,8,37,"Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gerasenes’ [those who come from pilgrimage or fight] round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again."
Luke,8,38,"Now the man out of whom the demons were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Yeshua [God is Salvation] sent him away, saying,"
Luke,8,39,"Return to your i own house, and show how great things God-Theos has done unto you i . And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Yeshua [God is Salvation] had done unto him."
Luke,8,40,"And it came to pass, that, when Yeshua [God is Salvation] was returned, the people [gladly] received him: for they were all waiting for him."
Luke,8,41,"And, behold, there came a man named Ya’ir [God enlightens] , and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Yeshua [God is Salvation] ’ feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:"
Luke,8,42,"For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him."
Luke,8,43,"And a woman having an issue (what comes forth) of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,"
Luke,8,44,"Came behind [him] , and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue (what comes forth) of blood stanched (stopped flowing)."
Luke,8,45,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said, Who touched me? When all denied, Kefa [pebble] and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng you i and press [you i ] , and say you i , Who touched me?"
Luke,8,46,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said, Somebody has touched me: for I perceive that virtue (power) is gone out of me."
Luke,8,47,"And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately."
Luke,8,48,"And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: your i faith has made you i whole; go in peace."
Luke,8,49,"While he yet spoke, there comes one from the ruler of the synagogue’s [house] , saying to him, You 1s daughter is dead; trouble not the Master."
Luke,8,50,"But when Yeshua [God is Salvation] heard [it] , he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole."
Luke,8,51,"And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Kefa [pebble] , and Ya’akov [heal-grabber] , and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , and the father and the mother of the virgin."
Luke,8,52,"And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleeps."
Luke,8,53,"And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead."
Luke,8,54,"And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise."
Luke,8,55,"And her Spirit [Ruach] came again, and she arose immediately: and he commanded to give her meat."
Luke,8,56,And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.
Luke,9,1,"Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases."
Luke,9,2,"And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God-Theos, and to heal the sick."
Luke,9,3,"And he said unto them, Take nothing for [your] journey, neither rods (clubs) , nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece."
Luke,9,4,"And whatsoever house you 2f enter into, there abide, and there depart."
Luke,9,5,"And whosoever will not receive you, when you 2f go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them."
Luke,9,6,"And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the Gospel (joyful message) , and healing every where."
Luke,9,7,"Now Herod [heroic] the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] was risen from the dead;"
Luke,9,8,"And of some, that Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again."
Luke,9,9,"And Herod [heroic] said, Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him."
Luke,9,10,"And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Beit-Tzaidah [house of fish]."
Luke,9,11,"And the people, when they knew [it] , followed him: and he received them, and spoke unto them of the kingdom of God-Theos, and healed them that had need of healing."
Luke,9,12,"And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals (food for humans) : for we are here in a desert place."
Luke,9,13,"But he said unto them, Give you 2f them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people."
Luke,9,14,"For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company."
Luke,9,15,"And they did so, and made them all sit down."
Luke,9,16,"Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) them, and broke, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude."
Luke,9,17,"And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets."
Luke,9,18,"And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?"
Luke,9,19,"They answering said, Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the Baptist; but some [say] , Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] ; and others [say] , that one of the old prophets is risen again."
Luke,9,20,"He said unto them, But whom say you 2f that I am? Kefa [pebble] answering said, The Moshiach [Messiah] of God-Theos."
Luke,9,21,"And he straitly charged them, and commanded [them] to tell no man that thing;"
Luke,9,22,"Saying, The Son of Man must suffer (allow, to let, permit) many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and Torah-teachers (Scribes) , and be slain, and be raised the third day."
Luke,9,23,"And he said to [them] all, If any [man] will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his stake (cross) daily, and follow me."
Luke,9,24,"For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it."
Luke,9,25,"For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?"
Luke,9,26,"For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and [in his] Father’s, and of the holy angels."
Luke,9,27,"But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God-Theos."
Luke,9,28,"And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Kefa [pebble] and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] and Ya’akov [heal-grabber] , and went up into a mountain to pray."
Luke,9,29,"And as he prayed, the fashion of his Countenance (Face, appearance; show favor) was altered, and his clothing [was] white [and] glistering."
Luke,9,30,"And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah]:"
Luke,9,31,"Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Luke,9,32,"But Kefa [pebble] and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him."
Luke,9,33,"And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Kefa [pebble] said unto Yeshua [God is Salvation] , Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for you i , and one for Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , and one for Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] : not knowing what he said."
Luke,9,34,"While he thus spoke, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud."
Luke,9,35,"And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him."
Luke,9,36,"And when the voice was past, Yeshua [God is Salvation] was found alone. And they kept [it] close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen."
Luke,9,37,"And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him."
Luke,9,38,"And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , look upon my son: for he is my only child."
Luke,9,39,"And, lo, a Spirit [Ruach] takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it tears him that he foams again, and bruising him hardly departs from him."
Luke,9,40,And I besought you i disciples to cast him out; and they could not.
Luke,9,41,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer (allow, to let, permit) you? Bring your i son here."
Luke,9,42,"And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare [him] . And Yeshua [God is Salvation] rebuked the unclean Spirit [Ruach] , and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father."
Luke,9,43,"And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God-Theos. But while they wondered every one at all things which Yeshua [God is Salvation] did, he said unto his disciples,"
Luke,9,44,Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men.
Luke,9,45,"But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying."
Luke,9,46,"Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest."
Luke,9,47,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] , perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,"
Luke,9,48,"And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receives me: and whosoever shall receive me receives him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great."
Luke,9,49,"And Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in your i name; and we forbad him, because he follows not with us."
Luke,9,50,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto him, Forbid [him] not, for he is not against you: for he that is not against us is for us."
Luke,9,51,"And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace],"
Luke,9,52,"And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Shomronim [of Samaria (the watch-mountain)] , to make ready for him."
Luke,9,53,"And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Luke,9,54,"And when his disciples Ya’akov [heal-grabber] and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] saw [this] , they said, Lord - Kurios, will you i that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] did?"
Luke,9,55,"But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, You 2f know not what manner of Spirit [Ruach] you 2f are of."
Luke,9,56,"For the Son of Man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save [them] . And they went to another village."
Luke,9,57,"And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain [man] said unto him, Lord - Kurios, I will follow you i to wherever you i go."
Luke,9,58,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air [have] nests; but the Son of Man has not where to lay [his] head."
Luke,9,59,"And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord - Kurios, suffer (allow, to let, permit) me first to go and bury my father."
Luke,9,60,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go you i and preach the kingdom of God-Theos."
Luke,9,61,"And another also said, Lord - Kurios, I will follow you i ; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house."
Luke,9,62,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God-Theos."
Luke,10,1,"After these things the Lord - Kurios appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, to which he himself would come."
Luke,10,2,"Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly [is] great, but the labourers [are] few: pray you 2f therefore the Lord - Kurios of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest."
Luke,10,3,"Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves."
Luke,10,4,"Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way."
Luke,10,5,"And into whatsoever house you 2f enter, first say, Peace [be] to this house."
Luke,10,6,"And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again."
Luke,10,7,"And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house."
Luke,10,8,"And into whatsoever city you 2f enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:"
Luke,10,9,"And heal the sick that are in it, and say unto them, The kingdom of God-Theos is come near unto you."
Luke,10,10,"But into whatsoever city you 2f enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,"
Luke,10,11,"Even the very dust of your city, which cleaves on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be you 2f sure of this, that the kingdom of God-Theos is come near unto you."
Luke,10,12,"But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for S’dom [Burning] , than for that city."
Luke,10,13,"Woe unto you i , Korazin [here is a mystery] ! woe unto you i , Beit-Tzaidah [house of fish] ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tzor [a rock] and Tzidon [hunting] , which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
Luke,10,14,"But it shall be more tolerable for Tzor [a rock] and Tzidon [hunting] at the judgment, than for you."
Luke,10,15,"And you i , K’far-Nachum [town of comfort] , which are exalted to heaven, shall be thrust down to hell."
Luke,10,16,He that hears you hears me; and he that despises you despises me; and he that despises me despises him that sent me.
Luke,10,17,"And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord - Kurios, even the demons are subject unto us through your i name."
Luke,10,18,"And he said unto them, I beheld Satan [the adversary] as lightning fall from heaven."
Luke,10,19,"Behold, I give unto you power to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you."
Luke,10,20,"Yet in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven."
Luke,10,21,"In that hour Yeshua [God is Salvation] rejoiced in Spirit [Ruach] , and said, I thank you i , O Father, Lord - Kurios of heaven and earth, that you i have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in your i sight."
Luke,10,22,"And having turned to the disciples, he said: All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knows who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and [he] to whom the Son will reveal [him]."
Luke,10,23,"And he turned him unto [his] disciples, and said privately, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [are] the eyes which see the things that you 2f see:"
Luke,10,24,"For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which you 2f see, and have not seen [them] ; and to hear those things which you 2f hear, and have not heard [them]."
Luke,10,25,"And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tried or tested him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
Luke,10,26,"He said unto him, What is written in the law? how read you i?"
Luke,10,27,"And he answering said, you i shall love the Lord - Kurios-Yehovah your i God-Theos with all your i heart, and with all your i soul, and with all yorui strength, and with all your i mind; and your i neighbour as yourself."
Luke,10,28,"And he said unto him, you i have answered right: this do, and you i shall live."
Luke,10,29,"But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Yeshua [God is Salvation] , And who is my neighbour?"
Luke,10,30,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering said, A certain [man] went down from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to Yericho [Its Moon] , and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his clothing, and wounded [him] , and departed, leaving [him] half dead."
Luke,10,31,"And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side."
Luke,10,32,"And likewise a Levi (Levite) [Joined to] , when he was at the place, came and looked [on him] , and passed by on the other side."
Luke,10,33,"But a certain Shomroni [watch-mountain] , as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion [on him],"
Luke,10,34,"And went to [him] , and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him."
Luke,10,35,"And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave [them] to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever you i spendest more, when I come again, I will repay you i."
Luke,10,36,"Which now of these three, think you i , was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?"
Luke,10,37,"And he said, He that showed mercy on him. Then said Yeshua [God is Salvation] unto him, Go, and do you i likewise."
Luke,10,38,"Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Marta [she was rebellious] received him into her house."
Luke,10,39,"And she had a sister called Miryam [waters of strength] , which also sat at Yeshua [God is Salvation] ’ feet, and heard his word."
Luke,10,40,"But Marta [she was rebellious] was cumbered (overwhelmed with cares) about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord - Kurios, do you i not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me."
Luke,10,41,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto her, Marta [she was rebellious] , Marta [she was rebellious] , you i are careful and troubled about many things:"
Luke,10,42,"But one thing is needful: and Miryam [waters of strength] has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her."
Luke,11,1,"And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord - Kurios, teach us to pray, as Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] also taught his disciples."
Luke,11,2,"And he said unto them, When you 2f pray, say, Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your i name. Your 1s kingdom come. Your 1s will be done, as in heaven, so in earth."
Luke,11,3,Give us day by day our daily bread.
Luke,11,4,And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.
Luke,11,5,"And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;"
Luke,11,6,"For a friend of my in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?"
Luke,11,7,"And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give you i."
Luke,11,8,"I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needs."
Luke,11,9,"And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you 2f shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you."
Luke,11,10,For every one that asks receives; and he that seeks finds; and to him that knocks it shall be opened.
Luke,11,11,"If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if [he ask] a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?"
Luke,11,12,"Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?"
Luke,11,13,"If you 2f then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall [your] heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit [Ruach] to them that ask him?"
Luke,11,14,"And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spoke; and the people wondered."
Luke,11,15,"But some of them said, He casts out demons through Beelzebub the chief of the demons."
Luke,11,16,"And others, tempting [him] , sought of him a sign from heaven."
Luke,11,17,"But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house [divided] against a house falls."
Luke,11,18,"If Satan [the adversary] also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because you 2f say that I cast out demons through Beelzebub."
Luke,11,19,"And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast [them] out? therefore shall they be your judges."
Luke,11,20,"But if I with the finger of God-Theos cast out demons, no doubt the kingdom of God-Theos is come upon you."
Luke,11,21,"When a strong man armed keeps his palace, his goods are in peace:"
Luke,11,22,"But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he takes from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divides his spoils."
Luke,11,23,He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathers not with me scatters.
Luke,11,24,"When the unclean Spirit [Ruach] is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he says, I will return unto my house from what place I came out."
Luke,11,25,"And when he comes, he finds [it] swept and garnished."
Luke,11,26,"Then goes he, and takes [to him] seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last [state] of that man is worse than the first."
Luke,11,27,"And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [is] the womb that bore you i , and the breasts which you i have sucked."
Luke,11,28,"But he said, Yes rather, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [are] they that hear the word of God-Theos, and keep it."
Luke,11,29,"And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Yochanan [dove] the prophet."
Luke,11,30,"For as Yochanan [dove] was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of Man be to this generation."
Luke,11,31,"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Shlomo [peace] (Solomon) ; and, behold, a greater than Shlomo [peace] (Solomon) [is] here."
Luke,11,32,"The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Yochanan [dove] ; and, behold, a greater than Yochanan [dove] [is] here."
Luke,11,33,"No man, when he has lighted a candle, puts [it] in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light."
Luke,11,34,"The light of the body is the eye: therefore when your i eye is single, your i whole body also is full of light; but when [your i eye] is evil, your i body also [is] full of darkness."
Luke,11,35,Take heed therefore that the light which is in you i be not darkness.
Luke,11,36,"If your i whole body therefore [be] full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle does give you i light."
Luke,11,37,"And as he spoke, a certain Pharisee [separatist] besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat."
Luke,11,38,"And when the Pharisee [separatist] saw [it] , he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner."
Luke,11,39,"And the Lord - Kurios said unto him, Now do you 2f P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening (preying upon to devour) and wickedness."
Luke,11,40," [You 2f ] fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?"
Luke,11,41,"But rather give alms of such things as you 2f have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you."
Luke,11,42,"But woe unto you, P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] ! for you 2f tithe mint and rue (an evergreen plant used for medicine) and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God-Theos: these ought you 2f to have done, and not to leave the other undone."
Luke,11,43,"Woe unto you, P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] ! for you 2f love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets."
Luke,11,44,"Woe unto you, Torah-teachers (Scribes) and P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] , hypocrites! for you 2f are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over [them] are not aware [of them]."
Luke,11,45,"Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying you i reproach (disgrace; shame) us also."
Luke,11,46,"And he said, Woe unto you also, [you 2f ] lawyers! for you 2f burden (to load) men with burdens grievous to be borne, and you 2f yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers."
Luke,11,47,"Woe unto you! for you 2f build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them."
Luke,11,48,"Truly you 2f bear witness that you 2f allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and you 2f build their sepulchres."
Luke,11,49,"Therefore also said the wisdom of God-Theos, I will send them prophets and apostles, and [some] of them they shall slay and persecute:"
Luke,11,50,"That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;"
Luke,11,51,"From the blood of Hevel (heardsman) unto the blood of Z’kharyah [remembered by Yehovah] , which perished between the altar and the temple: truly I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation."
Luke,11,52,"Woe unto you, lawyers! for you 2f have taken away the key of knowledge: you 2f entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in you 2f hindered."
Luke,11,53,"And as he said these things unto them, the Torah-teachers (Scribes) and the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] began to urge [him] vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:"
Luke,11,54,"Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him."
Luke,12,1,"In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trampled one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware you 2f of the leaven of the P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] , which is hypocrisy."
Luke,12,2,"For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known."
Luke,12,3,Therefore whatsoever you 2f have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which you 2f have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
Luke,12,4,"And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do."
Luke,12,5,"But I will forewarn you whom you 2f shall fear: Fear him, which after he has killed has power to cast into hell; yes, I say unto you, Fear him."
Luke,12,6,"Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God-Theos?"
Luke,12,7,But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: you 2f are of more value than many sparrows.
Luke,12,8,"Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God-Theos:"
Luke,12,9,But he that denies me before men shall be denied before the angels of God-Theos.
Luke,12,10,"And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemes against the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] it shall not be forgiven."
Luke,12,11,"And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and [unto] magistrates, and powers, take you 2f no thought how or what thing you 2f shall answer, or what you 2f shall say:"
Luke,12,12,For the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] shall teach you in the same hour what you 2f ought to say.
Luke,12,13,"And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me."
Luke,12,14,"And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?"
Luke,12,15,"And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses."
Luke,12,16,"And he spoke a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:"
Luke,12,17,"And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?"
Luke,12,18,"And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods."
Luke,12,19,"And I will say to my soul, Soul, you i have much goods laid up for many years; take your i ease, eat, drink, [and] be merry."
Luke,12,20,"But God-Theos said unto him, [you i ] fool, this night you i soul shall be required of you i : then whose shall those things be, which you i have provided?"
Luke,12,21,"So [is] he that lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God-Theos."
Luke,12,22,"And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what you 2f shall eat; neither for the body, what you 2f shall put on."
Luke,12,23,"The life is more than meat, and the body [is more] than clothing."
Luke,12,24,Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God-Theos feeds them: how much more are you 2f better than the fowls?
Luke,12,25,And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?
Luke,12,26,"If you 2f then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take you 2f thought for the rest?"
Luke,12,27,"Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Shlomo [peace] (Solomon) in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
Luke,12,28,"If then God- The Father so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and tomorrow is cast into the oven; how much more [will he clothe] you, O you 2f of little faith?"
Luke,12,29,"And seek not you 2f what you 2f shall eat, or what you 2f shall drink, neither be you 2f of doubtful mind."
Luke,12,30,For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knows that you 2f have need of these things.
Luke,12,31,But rather seek you 2f the kingdom of God-The Father; and all these things shall be added unto you.
Luke,12,32,"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom."
Luke,12,33,"Sell that you 2f have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which grow (become; advance) not old, a treasure in the heavens that fails not, where no thief approaches, neither moth corrupts."
Luke,12,34,"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
Luke,12,35,"Let your waist be girded about, and [your] lights burning;"
Luke,12,36,"And you 2f yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he comes and knocks, they may open unto him immediately."
Luke,12,37,"Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [are] those servants, whom the lord when he comes shall find watching: truly I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them."
Luke,12,38,"And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find [them] so, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) are those servants."
Luke,12,39,"And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through."
Luke,12,40,Be you 2f therefore ready also: for the Son of Man comes at an hour when you 2f think not.
Luke,12,41,"Then Kefa [pebble] said unto him, Lord - Kurios, speak you i this parable unto us, or even to all?"
Luke,12,42,"And the Lord - Kurios said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom [his] lord shall make ruler over his household, to give [them their] portion of meat in due season?"
Luke,12,43,"Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [is] that slave, whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing."
Luke,12,44,"Of a tI say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he has."
Luke,12,45,"But and if that slave say in his heart, My lord delays his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;"
Luke,12,46,"The lord of that slave will come in a day when he looks not for [him] , and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers."
Luke,12,47,"And that slave, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not [himself] , neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many [stripes]."
Luke,12,48,"But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few [stripes] . For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more."
Luke,12,49,"I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?"
Luke,12,50,"But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened (impeded or restricted; narrowed, distressed) till it be accomplished!"
Luke,12,51,"Suppose you 2f that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, No; but rather division:"
Luke,12,52,"For from from this time forth (from now on) there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three."
Luke,12,53,"The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law."
Luke,12,54,"And he said also to the people, When you 2f see a cloud rise out of the west, immediately you 2f say, There comes a shower; and so it is."
Luke,12,55,"And when [you 2f see] the south wind blow, you 2f say, There will be heat; and it comes to pass."
Luke,12,56," [You 2f ] hypocrites, you 2f can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that you 2f do not discern this time?"
Luke,12,57,"Yes, and why even of yourselves judge you 2f not what is right?"
Luke,12,58,"When you i go with your i adversary to the magistrate, [as you i are] in the way, give diligence that you i may be delivered from him; lest he drag (force) you i to the judge, and the judge deliver you i to the officer, and the officer cast you i into prison."
Luke,12,59,"I tell you i , you i shall not depart there, till you i have paid the very last mite (a coin of very small value)."
Luke,13,1,"There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans [wheel] , whose blood Pilate [armed with a spear] had mingled with their sacrifices."
Luke,13,2,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering said unto them, Suppose you 2f that these Galilaeans [wheel] were sinners above all the Galilaeans [wheel] , because they suffered such things?"
Luke,13,3,"I tell you, No: but, except you 2f repent, you 2f shall all likewise perish."
Luke,13,4,"Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, think you 2f that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]?"
Luke,13,5,"I tell you, No: but, except you 2f repent, you 2f shall all likewise perish."
Luke,13,6,"He spoke also this parable; A certain [man] had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none."
Luke,13,7,"Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbers it the ground?"
Luke,13,8,"And he answering said unto him, Lord - Kurios, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung [it]:"
Luke,13,9,"And if it bear fruit, [well] : and if not, [then] after that you i shall cut it down."
Luke,13,10,And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Shabbat [rest].
Luke,13,11,"And, behold, there was a woman which had a Spirit [Ruach] of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could assuredly not (by no means) lift up [herself]."
Luke,13,12,"And when Yeshua [God is Salvation] saw her, he called [her to him] , and said unto her, Woman, you i are loosed from your i infirmity."
Luke,13,13,"And he laid [his] hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God-Theos."
Luke,13,14,"And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Yeshua [God is Salvation] had healed on the Shabbat [rest] day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the Shabbat [rest] day."
Luke,13,15,"The Lord - Kurios then answered him, and said, [you i ] hypocrite, does not each one of you on the Shabbat [rest] loose his ox or [his] ass from the stall, and lead [him] away to watering?"
Luke,13,16,"And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Avraham [Exalted Father] , whom Satan [the adversary] has bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Shabbat [rest] day?"
Luke,13,17,"And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him."
Luke,13,18,"Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God-The Father like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?"
Luke,13,19,"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it."
Luke,13,20,"And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God-The Father?"
Luke,13,21,"It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened."
Luke,13,22,"And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Luke,13,23,"Then said one unto him, Lord - Kurios-Adon, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them,"
Luke,13,24,"Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able."
Luke,13,25,"When once the master of the house is risen up, and has shut to the door, and you 2f begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord - Kurios, Lord - Kurios, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not from what place you 2f are:"
Luke,13,26,"Then shall you 2f begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in your i presence, and you i have taught in our streets."
Luke,13,27,"But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not from what place you 2f are; depart from me, all [you 2f ] workers of iniquity."
Luke,13,28,"There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you 2f shall see Avraham [Exalted Father] , and Yitz’khak [Laughter] , and Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] [Heal of God] , and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God-Theos, and you [yourselves] thrust out."
Luke,13,29,"And they shall come from the east, and [from] the west, and from the north, and [from] the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God-Theos."
Luke,13,30,"And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last."
Luke,13,31,"The same day there came certain of the P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] , saying unto him, Get you i out, and depart hence: for Herod [heroic] will kill you i."
Luke,13,32,"And he said unto them, Go you 2f , and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons, and I do cures to day and tomorrow, and the third [day] I shall be perfected."
Luke,13,33,"Nevertheless I must walk to day, and tomorrow, and the [day] following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Luke,13,34,"O Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , which kill the prophets, and stone them that are sent unto you i ; how often would I have gathered your i children together, as a hen [does gather] her brood (animal offspring) under [her] wings, and you 2f would not!"
Luke,13,35,"Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and truly I say unto you, You 2f shall not see me, until [the time] come when you 2f shall say, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [is] he that comes in the name of the Lord - Kurios."
Luke,14,1,"And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] to eat bread on the Shabbat [rest] day, that they watched him."
Luke,14,2,"And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy (an illness where a part or all of the body swells with too much water)."
Luke,14,3,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering spoke unto the lawyers and P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist]s) [separatists] , saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Shabbat [rest] day?"
Luke,14,4,"And they held their peace. And he took [him] , and healed him, and let him go;"
Luke,14,5,"And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not immediately pull him out on the Shabbat [rest] day?"
Luke,14,6,And they could not answer him again to these things.
Luke,14,7,"And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,"
Luke,14,8,"When you i are bidden of any [man] to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than you i be bidden of him;"
Luke,14,9,"And he that bade you i and him come and say to you i , Give this man place; and you i begin with shame to take the lowest room."
Luke,14,10,"But when you i are bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade you i comes, he may say unto you i , Friend, go up higher: then shall you i have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with you i."
Luke,14,11,For whosoever exalts himself shall be abased; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.
Luke,14,12,"Then said he also to him that bade him, When you i make a dinner or a supper, call not your i friends, nor your i brethren, neither your i kinsmen, nor [your i ] rich neighbours; lest they also bid you i again, and a recompence (punishment for evil, reward) be made you i."
Luke,14,13,"But when you i make a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:"
Luke,14,14,And you i shall be Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) ; for they cannot recompense you i : for you i shall be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.
Luke,14,15,"And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [is] he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God-Theos."
Luke,14,16,"Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:"
Luke,14,17,"And sent his slave at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready."
Luke,14,18,"And they all with one [consent] began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray you i have me excused."
Luke,14,19,"And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray you i have me excused."
Luke,14,20,"And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come."
Luke,14,21,"So that slave came, and showed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his slave, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor, and the maimed, and the lame (crippled in the feet) , and the blind."
Luke,14,22,"And the slave said, Lord - Kurios-Adon, it is done as you i have commanded, and yet there is room."
Luke,14,23,"And the lord said unto the slave, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel [them] to come in, that my house may be filled."
Luke,14,24,"For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper."
Luke,14,25,"And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,"
Luke,14,26,"If any [man] come to me, and love less by comparison not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."
Luke,14,27,"And whosoever does not bear his stake (cross) , and come after me, cannot be my disciple."
Luke,14,28,"For which of you, intending to build a tower, sits not down first, and count the cost, whether he have [sufficient] to finish [it]?"
Luke,14,29,"Lest perhaps (maybe) , after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish [it] , all that behold [it] begin to mock him,"
Luke,14,30,"Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish."
Luke,14,31,"Or what king, going to make war against another king, sits not down first, and consult whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that comes against him with twenty thousand?"
Luke,14,32,"Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he send an ambassage, and desires conditions of peace."
Luke,14,33,"So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsake not all that he has, he cannot be my disciple."
Luke,14,34,"Salt [is] good: but if the salt have lost his savour, which shall it be seasoned?"
Luke,14,35,"It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; [but] men cast it out. He that has ears to hear, let him hear."
Luke,15,1,Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.
Luke,15,2,"And the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] and Torah-teachers (Scribes) murmured, saying, This man receives sinners, and eats with them."
Luke,15,3,"And he spoke this parable unto them, saying,"
Luke,15,4,"What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?"
Luke,15,5,"And when he has found [it] , he lays [it] on his shoulders, rejoicing."
Luke,15,6,"And when he comes home, he calls together [his] friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost."
Luke,15,7,"I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repents, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance."
Luke,15,8,"Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, does not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find [it]?"
Luke,15,9,"And when she has found [it] , she calls [her] friends and [her] neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost."
Luke,15,10,"Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God-Theos over one sinner that repents."
Luke,15,11,"And he said, A certain man had two sons:"
Luke,15,12,"And the younger of them said to [his] father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falls [to me] . And he divided unto them [his] living."
Luke,15,13,"And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living."
Luke,15,14,"And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want."
Luke,15,15,And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
Luke,15,16,And he would fain (earnestly want to or long to; gladly) have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.
Luke,15,17,"And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!"
Luke,15,18,"I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before you i,"
Luke,15,19,And am no more worthy to be called your i son: make me as one of your i hired servants.
Luke,15,20,"And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him."
Luke,15,21,"And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your i sight, and am no more worthy to be called your i son."
Luke,15,22,"But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put [it] on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on [his] feet:"
Luke,15,23,"And bring here the fatted calf, and kill [it] ; and let us eat, and be merry:"
Luke,15,24,"For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry."
Luke,15,25,"Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing."
Luke,15,26,"And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant."
Luke,15,27,"And he said unto him, You 1s brother is come; and your i father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound."
Luke,15,28,"And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him."
Luke,15,29,"And he answering said to [his] father, Lo, these many years do I serve you i , neither transgressed I at any time your i commandment: and yet you i never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:"
Luke,15,30,"But as soon as this your i son was come, which has devoured you i living with prostitutes, you i have killed for him the fatted calf."
Luke,15,31,"And he said unto him, Son, you i are ever with me, and all that I have is yoursi."
Luke,15,32,"It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this your i brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found."
Luke,16,1,"And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods."
Luke,16,2,"And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of you i ? give an account of your i stewardship; for you i may be no longer steward."
Luke,16,3,"Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord takes away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed."
Luke,16,4,"I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses."
Luke,16,5,"So he called every one of his lord’s debtors [unto him] , and said unto the first, How much owe you i unto my lord?"
Luke,16,6,"And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take your i bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty."
Luke,16,7,"Then said he to another, And how much owe you i ? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take your i bill, and write eighty."
Luke,16,8,"And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light."
Luke,16,9,"And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon (earthly goods; property; riches) of unrighteousness; that, when you 2f fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations."
Luke,16,10,He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.
Luke,16,11,"If therefore you 2f have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon (earthly goods; property; riches) , who will commit to your trust the true [riches]?"
Luke,16,12,"And if you 2f have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own?"
Luke,16,13,"No slave can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You 2f cannot serve God-Theos and mammon (earthly goods; property; riches)."
Luke,16,14,"And the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him."
Luke,16,15,"And he said unto them, You 2f are they which justify yourselves before men; but God-Theos knows your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God-Theos."
Luke,16,16,"The law and the prophets [were] until Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] : since that time the kingdom of God-Theos is preached, and every man presses into it."
Luke,16,17,"And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the Torah to fail."
Luke,16,18,"Whosoever puts away his wife, and marries another, commit adultery: and whosoever marries her that is put away from [her] husband commit adultery."
Luke,16,19,"There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:"
Luke,16,20,"And there was a certain beggar named El’azar [whom God helps] , which was laid at his gate, full of sores,"
Luke,16,21,And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
Luke,16,22,"And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Avraham [Exalted Father] ’s [Exalted Father] bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;"
Luke,16,23,"And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and sees Avraham [Exalted Father] afar off, and El’azar [whom God helps] in his bosom."
Luke,16,24,"And he cried and said, Father Avraham [Exalted Father] , have mercy on me, and send El’azar [whom God helps] , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame."
Luke,16,25,"But Avraham [Exalted Father] said, Son, remember that you i in your i lifetime received your i good things, and likewise El’azar [whom God helps] evil things: but now he is comforted, and you i are tormented."
Luke,16,26,"And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that [would come] from there."
Luke,16,27,"Then he said, I pray you i therefore, father, that you i would send him to my father’s house:"
Luke,16,28,"For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment."
Luke,16,29,"Avraham [Exalted Father] says unto him, They have Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and the prophets; let them hear them."
Luke,16,30,"And he said, No, father Avraham [Exalted Father] : but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent."
Luke,16,31,"And he said unto him, If they hear not Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."
Luke,17,1,"Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe [unto him] , through whom they come!"
Luke,17,2,"It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend (make angry; make one stumble; violate) one of these little ones."
Luke,17,3,"Take heed to yourselves: If your i brother trespass against you i , rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) him; and if he repent, forgive him."
Luke,17,4,"And if he trespass against you i seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to you i , saying, I repent; you i shall forgive him."
Luke,17,5,"And the apostles said unto the Lord - Kurios, Increase our faith."
Luke,17,6,"And the Lord - Kurios-Adon said, If you 2f had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you 2f might say unto this sycamine tree, Be you i plucked up by the root, and be you i planted in the sea; and it should obey you."
Luke,17,7,"But which of you, having a slave plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?"
Luke,17,8,"And will not rather say unto him, Make ready which I may eat, and gird yourself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward you i shall eat and drink?"
Luke,17,9,Does he thank that slave because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow (to think; believe; trust) not.
Luke,17,10,"So likewise you 2f , when you 2f shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do."
Luke,17,11,"And it came to pass, as he went to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , that he passed through the midst of Shomron [watch mountain] and Galil [circuit, district]."
Luke,17,12,"And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:"
Luke,17,13,"And they lifted up [their] voices, and said, Yeshua [God is Salvation] , Master, have mercy on us."
Luke,17,14,"And when he saw [them] , he said unto them, Go show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed."
Luke,17,15,"And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God-Theos,"
Luke,17,16,"And fell down on [his] face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Shomroni [watch-mountain]."
Luke,17,17,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where [are] the nine?"
Luke,17,18,"There are not found that returned to give glory to God-Theos, save this stranger."
Luke,17,19,"And he said unto him, Arise, go your i way: your i faith has made you i whole."
Luke,17,20,"And when he was demanded of the P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] , when the kingdom of God-The Father should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God-The Father comes not with observation:"
Luke,17,21,"Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God-The Father is within you."
Luke,17,22,"And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when you 2f shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you 2f shall not see [it]."
Luke,17,23,"And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after [them] , nor follow [them]."
Luke,17,24,"For as the lightning, that lightens out of the one [part] under heaven, shines unto the other [part] under heaven; so shall also the Son of Man be in his day."
Luke,17,25,"But first must he suffer (allow, to let, permit) many things, and be rejected of this generation."
Luke,17,26,"And as it was in the days of Noach [rest] , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man."
Luke,17,27,"They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noach [rest] entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all."
Luke,17,28,"Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;"
Luke,17,29,"But the same day that Lot went out of S’dom [Burning] it rained fire and sulfur from heaven, and destroyed [them] all."
Luke,17,30,Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.
Luke,17,31,"In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back."
Luke,17,32,Remember Lot’s wife.
Luke,17,33,Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.
Luke,17,34,"I tell you, in that night there shall be two [men] in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left."
Luke,17,35,"Two [women] shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left."
Luke,17,36,"Two [men] shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left."
Luke,17,37,"And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord - Kurios? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body [is] , there will the eagles be gathered together."
Luke,18,1,"And he spoke a parable unto them [to this end] , that men ought always to pray, and not to give up;"
Luke,18,2,"Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God-Theos, neither regarded man:"
Luke,18,3,"And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary."
Luke,18,4,"And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God-Theos, nor regard man;"
Luke,18,5,"Yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me."
Luke,18,6,"And the Lord - Kurios said, Hear what the unjust judge says."
Luke,18,7,"And shall not God-Theos avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?"
Luke,18,8,"I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of Man comes, shall he find faith on the earth?"
Luke,18,9,"And he spoke this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:"
Luke,18,10,"Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee [separatist] , and the other a publican (tax collector)."
Luke,18,11,"The Pharisee [separatist] stood and prayed thus with himself, God-Theos, I thank you i , that I am not as other men [are] , extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican (tax collector)."
Luke,18,12,"I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I acquire."
Luke,18,13,"And the publican (tax collector) , standing afar off, would not lift up so much as [his] eyes unto heaven, but struck upon his breast, saying, God-Theos be merciful to me a sinner."
Luke,18,14,"I tell you, this man went down to his house justified [rather] than the other: for every one that exalts himself shall be abased; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted."
Luke,18,15,"And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when [his] disciples saw [it] , they rebuked them."
Luke,18,16,"But Yeshua [God is Salvation] called them [unto him] , and said, Suffer (allow, to let, permit) little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God-Theos."
Luke,18,17,"Truly I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God-Theos as a little child shall assuredly not (by no means) enter in it."
Luke,18,18,"And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
Luke,18,19,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto him, Why call you i me good? none [is] good, save one, [that is] , God-Theos."
Luke,18,20,"you i know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour your i father and your i mother."
Luke,18,21,"And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up."
Luke,18,22,"Now when Yeshua [God is Salvation] heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lack you i one thing: sell all that you i have, and distribute unto the poor, and you i shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me."
Luke,18,23,"And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich."
Luke,18,24,"And when Yeshua [God is Salvation] saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God-Theos!"
Luke,18,25,"For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God-Theos."
Luke,18,26,"And they that heard [it] said, Who then can be saved?"
Luke,18,27,"And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God-Theos."
Luke,18,28,"Then Kefa [pebble] said, Lo, we have left all, and followed you i."
Luke,18,29,"And he said unto them, Truly I say unto you, There is no man that has left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God-Theos’s sake,"
Luke,18,30,"Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting."
Luke,18,31,"Then he took [unto him] the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man shall be accomplished."
Luke,18,32,"For he shall be delivered unto the Goyim [Gentiles] , and shall be deceived, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:"
Luke,18,33,"And they shall scourge [him] , and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again."
Luke,18,34,"And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken."
Luke,18,35,"And it came to pass, that as he was come near unto Yericho [Its Moon] , a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:"
Luke,18,36,"And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant."
Luke,18,37,"And they told him, that Yeshua [God is Salvation] of Natzeret [one separated] passes by."
Luke,18,38,"And he cried, saying, Yeshua [God is Salvation], [you i ] Son of David [Beloved] , have mercy on me."
Luke,18,39,"And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, [you i ] Son of David [Beloved] , have mercy on me."
Luke,18,40,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,"
Luke,18,41,"Saying, What will you i that I shall do unto you i ? And he said, Lord - Kurios, that I may receive my sight."
Luke,18,42,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto him, Receive your i sight: your i faith has saved you i."
Luke,18,43,"And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God-Theos: and all the people, when they saw [it] , gave praise unto God-Theos."
Luke,19,1,And [Yeshua [God is Salvation] ] entered and passed through Yericho [Its Moon].
Luke,19,2,"And, behold, [there was] a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich."
Luke,19,3,"And he sought to see Yeshua [God is Salvation] who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature."
Luke,19,4,"And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that [way]."
Luke,19,5,"And when Yeshua [God is Salvation] came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at your i house."
Luke,19,6,"And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully."
Luke,19,7,"And when they saw [it] , they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner."
Luke,19,8,"And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord - Kurios; Behold, Lord - Kurios, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore [him] fourfold."
Luke,19,9,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Avraham [Exalted Father]."
Luke,19,10,For the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
Luke,19,11,"And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and because they thought that the kingdom of God-Theos should immediately appear."
Luke,19,12,"He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return."
Luke,19,13,"And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come."
Luke,19,14,"But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this [man] to reign over us."
Luke,19,15,"And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading."
Luke,19,16,"Then came the first, saying, Lord - Kurios, your i pound has gained ten pounds."
Luke,19,17,"And he said unto him, Well, you i good slave: because you i have been faithful in a very little, have you i authority over ten cities."
Luke,19,18,"And the second came, saying, Lord - Kurios, your i pound has gained five pounds."
Luke,19,19,"And he said likewise to him, Be you i also over five cities."
Luke,19,20,"And another came, saying, Lord - Kurios, behold, [here is] your i pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:"
Luke,19,21,"For I feared you i , because you i are an austere (severe; strict; harsh; solemn) man: you i take up that you i layed not down, and reap that you i did not sow."
Luke,19,22,"And he says unto him, Out of your i own mouth will I judge you i, [you i ] wicked slave. you i knew that I was an austere (severe; strict; harsh; solemn) man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:"
Luke,19,23,"For what reason then gave not your i my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required my own with usury (interest paid for using money)?"
Luke,19,24,"And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give [it] to him that has ten pounds."
Luke,19,25,"(And they said unto him, Lord - Kurios, he has ten pounds.)"
Luke,19,26,"For I say unto you, That unto every one which has shall be given; and from him that has not, even that he has shall be taken away from him."
Luke,19,27,"But those my enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring here, and slay [them] before me."
Luke,19,28,"And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Luke,19,29,"And it came to pass, when he was come near to Beit-Pagei [house of unripe figs] and Beit-Anyah [house of figs] , at the mount called [the mount] of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,"
Luke,19,30,"Saying, Go you 2f into the village over against [you] ; in the which at your entering you 2f shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring [him here]."
Luke,19,31,"And if any man ask you, Why do you 2f loose [him] ? thus shall you 2f say unto him, Because the Lord - Kurios has need of him."
Luke,19,32,"And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them."
Luke,19,33,"And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose you 2f the colt?"
Luke,19,34,"And they said, The Lord - Kurios has need of him."
Luke,19,35,"And they brought him to Yeshua [God is Salvation] : and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Yeshua [God is Salvation] thereon."
Luke,19,36,"And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way."
Luke,19,37,"And when he was come near, even now at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God-Theos with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;"
Luke,19,38,"Saying, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the King that comes in the name of the Lord - Kurios: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest."
Luke,19,39,"And some of the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) your i disciples."
Luke,19,40,"And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out."
Luke,19,41,"And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,"
Luke,19,42,"Saying, If you i had known, even you i , at least in this your i day, the things [which belong] unto your i peace! but now they are hid from your i eyes."
Luke,19,43,"For the days shall come upon you i , that your i enemies shall cast a trench about you i , and compass (go around, encircle; encompass) you i round, and keep you i in on every side,"
Luke,19,44,"And shall lay you i even with the ground, and your i children within you i ; and they shall not leave in you i one stone upon another; because you i knew not the time of your i visitation."
Luke,19,45,"And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold in it, and them that bought;"
Luke,19,46,"Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but you 2f have made it a den of thieves."
Luke,19,47,"And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the Torah-teachers (Scribes) and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,"
Luke,19,48,And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.
Luke,20,1,"And it came to pass, [that] on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the Gospel (joyful message) , the chief priests and the Torah-teachers (Scribes) came upon [him] with the elders,"
Luke,20,2,"And spoke unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority do you i these things? or who is he that gave you i this authority?"
Luke,20,3,"And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:"
Luke,20,4,"The baptism of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , was it from heaven, or of men?"
Luke,20,5,"And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed you 2f him not?"
Luke,20,6,"But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] was a prophet."
Luke,20,7,"And they answered, that they could not tell from what place [it was]."
Luke,20,8,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things."
Luke,20,9,"Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time."
Luke,20,10,"And at the season he sent a slave to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent [him] away empty."
Luke,20,11,"And again he sent another slave: and they beat him also, and entreated [him] shamefully, and sent [him] away empty."
Luke,20,12,"And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast [him] out."
Luke,20,13,"Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence [him] when they see him."
Luke,20,14,"But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours."
Luke,20,15,"So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed [him] . What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?"
Luke,20,16,"He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard [it] , they said, God-Theos forbid."
Luke,20,17,"And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?"
Luke,20,18,"Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."
Luke,20,19,And the chief priests and the Torah-teachers (Scribes) the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.
Luke,20,20,"And they watched [him] , and sent forth spies, which should feign (to pretend to be; to disguise) themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor."
Luke,20,21,"And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that you i say and teaches rightly, neither accept you i the person [of any] , but teaches the way of God-Theos truly:"
Luke,20,22,"Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar [venerable] , or no?"
Luke,20,23,"But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt you 2f me?"
Luke,20,24,"Show me a penny. Whose image and superscription has it? They answered and said, Caesar [venerable] ’s."
Luke,20,25,"And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar [venerable] the things which be Caesar [venerable] ’s, and unto God-Theos the things which be God-Theos’s."
Luke,20,26,"And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace."
Luke,20,27,"Then came to [him] certain of the Tz’dukim (Sadducees) [followers of the right] , which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,"
Luke,20,28,"Saying, Master, Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] wrote unto us, If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother."
Luke,20,29,"There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children."
Luke,20,30,"And the second took her to wife, and he died childless."
Luke,20,31,"And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died."
Luke,20,32,Last of all the woman died also.
Luke,20,33,Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.
Luke,20,34,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:"
Luke,20,35,"But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:"
Luke,20,36,"Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God-Theos, being the children of the resurrection."
Luke,20,37,"Now that the dead are raised, even Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] showed at the bush, when he calls the Lord - Kurios the God-Theos of Avraham [Exalted Father] , and the God-Theos of Yitz’khak [Laughter] , and the God-Theos of Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] [Heal of God]."
Luke,20,38,"For he is not a God-Theos of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him."
Luke,20,39,"Then certain of the Torah-teachers (Scribes) answering said, Master, you i have well said."
Luke,20,40,And after that they dared (was bold enough) not ask him any [question at all].
Luke,20,41,"And he said unto them, How say they that Moshiach [Messiah] is David [Beloved] ’s [beloved] ’s son?"
Luke,20,42,"And David [Beloved] himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said unto my Lord – (Adon – Lord of the Earth) , Sit you i on my right hand,"
Luke,20,43,Till I make your i enemies your i footstool.
Luke,20,44,"David [Beloved] therefore calls him Lord - Kurios, how is he then his son?"
Luke,20,45,"Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,"
Luke,20,46,"Beware of the Torah-teachers (Scribes) , which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;"
Luke,20,47,"Which devour widows’ houses, and for a show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation."
Luke,21,1,"And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury."
Luke,21,2,And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in there two mites.
Luke,21,3,"And he said, Of a tI say unto you, that this poor widow has cast in more than they all:"
Luke,21,4,For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God-Theos: but she of her poverty has cast in all the living that she had.
Luke,21,5,"And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,"
Luke,21,6," [As for] these things which you 2f behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."
Luke,21,7,"And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign [will there be] when these things shall come to pass?"
Luke,21,8,"And he said, Take heed that you 2f be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am [Moshiach [Messiah] ]; and the time draws near: go you 2f not therefore after them."
Luke,21,9,"But when you 2f shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end [is] not by and by."
Luke,21,10,"Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:"
Luke,21,11,"And great earthquakes shall be in different places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven."
Luke,21,12,"But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute [you] , delivering [you] up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake."
Luke,21,13,And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
Luke,21,14,"Settle [it] therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what you 2f shall answer:"
Luke,21,15,"For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to contradict (oppose) nor resist."
Luke,21,16,"And you 2f shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and relatives, and friends; and [some] of you shall they cause to be put to death."
Luke,21,17,And you 2f shall be hated of all [men] for my name’s sake.
Luke,21,18,But there shall not an hair of your head perish.
Luke,21,19,In your patience possess you 2f your souls.
Luke,21,20,"And when you 2f shall see Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is near."
Luke,21,21,Then let them which are in Y’hudah [praised] flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.
Luke,21,22,"For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled."
Luke,21,23,"But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people."
Luke,21,24,"And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] shall be trampled down of the Goyim [Gentiles] , until the times of the Goyim [Gentiles] be fulfilled."
Luke,21,25,"And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;"
Luke,21,26,"Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken."
Luke,21,27,And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
Luke,21,28,"And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draws near."
Luke,21,29,"And he spoke to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;"
Luke,21,30,"When they now shoot forth, you 2f see and know of your own selves that summer is now near at hand."
Luke,21,31,"So likewise you 2f , when you 2f see these things come to pass, know you 2f that the kingdom of God-Theos is near at hand."
Luke,21,32,"Truly I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled."
Luke,21,33,Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
Luke,21,34,"And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be burdened (weighed down) with overindulgence (excess food or drink) , and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and [so] that day come upon you unawares."
Luke,21,35,For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
Luke,21,36,"Watch you 2f therefore, and pray always, that you 2f may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man."
Luke,21,37,"And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called [the mount] of Olives."
Luke,21,38,"And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him."
Luke,22,1,"Now the feast of unleavened bread drew near, which is called the Passover."
Luke,22,2,And the chief priests and Torah-teachers (Scribes) sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
Luke,22,3,"Then entered Satan [the adversary] into Y’hudah [praised] surnamed From K’riot [cities] , being of the number of the twelve."
Luke,22,4,"And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them."
Luke,22,5,"And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money."
Luke,22,6,"And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude."
Luke,22,7,"Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the Passover must be killed."
Luke,22,8,"And he sent Kefa [pebble] and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , saying, Go and prepare us the Passover, that we may eat."
Luke,22,9,"And they said unto him, Where will you i that we prepare?"
Luke,22,10,"And he said unto them, Behold, when you 2f are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he enters in."
Luke,22,11,"And you 2f shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master says unto you i , Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?"
Luke,22,12,And he shall show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
Luke,22,13,"And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the Passover."
Luke,22,14,"And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him."
Luke,22,15,"And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer (allow, to let, permit):"
Luke,22,16,"For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God-Theos."
Luke,22,17,"And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide [it] among yourselves:"
Luke,22,18,"For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God-Theos shall come."
Luke,22,19,"And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke [it] , and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me."
Luke,22,20,"Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup [is] the new testament (a covenant, ratified in death) in my blood, which is shed for you."
Luke,22,21,"But, behold, the hand of him that betrays me [is] with me on the table."
Luke,22,22,"And truly the Son of Man goes, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!"
Luke,22,23,"And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing."
Luke,22,24,"And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest."
Luke,22,25,"And he said unto them, The kings of the Goyim [Gentiles] exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors."
Luke,22,26,"But you 2f [shall] not [be] so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that does serve."
Luke,22,27,"For whether [is] greater, he that sits at meat, or he that serves? [is] not he that sits at meat? but I am among you as he that serves."
Luke,22,28,You 2f are they which have continued with me in my temptations.
Luke,22,29,"And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father has appointed unto me;"
Luke,22,30,"That you 2f may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God]."
Luke,22,31,"And the Lord - Kurios said, Shim’on [he has heard] , Shim’on [he has heard] , behold, Satan [the adversary] has desired [to have] you, that he may sift [you] as wheat:"
Luke,22,32,"But I have prayed for you i , that your i faith fail not: and when you i are converted, strengthen your i brethren."
Luke,22,33,"And he said unto him, Lord - Kurios, I am ready to go with you i , both into prison, and to death."
Luke,22,34,"And he said, I tell you i , Kefa [pebble] , the cock shall not crow this day, before that you i shall thrice deny that you i know me."
Luke,22,35,"And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked you 2f any thing? And they said, Nothing."
Luke,22,36,"Then said he unto them, But now, he that has a purse, let him take [it] , and likewise [his] scrip: and he that has no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one."
Luke,22,37,"For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end."
Luke,22,38,"And they said, Lord - Kurios, behold, here [are] two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough."
Luke,22,39,"And he came out, and went, as he was wont (used to; in the habit of) , to the Mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him."
Luke,22,40,"And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that you 2f enter not into temptation."
Luke,22,41,"And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,"
Luke,22,42,"Saying, Father, if you i be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but your i , be done."
Luke,22,43,"And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him."
Luke,22,44,And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
Luke,22,45,"And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,"
Luke,22,46,"And said unto them, Why sleep you 2f ? rise and pray, lest you 2f enter into temptation."
Luke,22,47,"And while he yet spoke, behold a multitude, and he that was called Y’hudah [praised] , one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Yeshua [God is Salvation] to kiss him."
Luke,22,48,"But Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto him, Y’hudah [praised] , betray you i the Son of Man with a kiss?"
Luke,22,49,"When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord - Kurios, shall we strike with the sword?"
Luke,22,50,"And one of them struck the slave of the High Priest, and cut off his right ear."
Luke,22,51,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said, Suffer (allow, to let, permit) you 2f thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him."
Luke,22,52,"Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be you 2f come out, as against a thief, with swords and rods (clubs)?"
Luke,22,53,"When I was daily with you in the temple, you 2f stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness."
Luke,22,54,"Then took they him, and led [him] , and brought him into the high priest’s house. And Kefa [pebble] followed afar off."
Luke,22,55,"And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Kefa [pebble] sat down among them."
Luke,22,56,"But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him."
Luke,22,57,"And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not."
Luke,22,58,"And after a little while another saw him, and said, you i are also of them. And Kefa [pebble] said, Man, I am not."
Luke,22,59,"And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a tthis [fellow] also was with him: for he is a Galilaean [circle]."
Luke,22,60,"And Kefa [pebble] said, Man, I know not what you i say. And immediately, while he yet spoke, the cock crew."
Luke,22,61,"And the Lord - Kurios turned, and looked upon Kefa [pebble] . And Kefa [pebble] remembered the word of the Lord - Kurios, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, you i shall deny me thrice."
Luke,22,62,"And Kefa [pebble] went out, and wept bitterly."
Luke,22,63,"And the men that held Yeshua [God is Salvation] deceived him, and struck [him]."
Luke,22,64,"And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that struck you i?"
Luke,22,65,And many other things blasphemously spoke they against him.
Luke,22,66,"And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the Torah-teachers (Scribes) came together, and led him into their council, saying,"
Luke,22,67,"Are you i the Moshiach [Messiah] ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, you 2f will not believe:"
Luke,22,68,"And if I also ask [you] , you 2f will not answer me, nor let [me] go."
Luke,22,69,Hereafter shall the Son of Man sit on the right hand of the power of God-Theos.
Luke,22,70,"Then said they all, Are you i then the Son of God-Theos? And he said unto them, You 2f say that I am."
Luke,22,71,"And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth."
Luke,23,1,"And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate [armed with a spear]."
Luke,23,2,"And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this [fellow] perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar [venerable] , saying that he himself is Moshiach [Messiah] a King."
Luke,23,3,"And Pilate [armed with a spear] asked him, saying, Are you i the King of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] ? And he answered him and said, you i say [it]."
Luke,23,4,"Then said Pilate [armed with a spear] to the chief priests and [to] the people, I find no fault in this man."
Luke,23,5,"And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galil [circuit, district] to this place."
Luke,23,6,"When Pilate [armed with a spear] heard of Galil [circuit, district] , he asked whether the man were a Galilaean [circle]."
Luke,23,7,"And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod [heroic] ’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod [heroic] , who himself also was at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] at that time."
Luke,23,8,"And when Herod [heroic] saw Yeshua [God is Salvation] , he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long [season] , because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him."
Luke,23,9,Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
Luke,23,10,And the chief priests and Torah-teachers (Scribes) stood and vehemently accused him.
Luke,23,11,"And Herod [heroic] with his men of war set him at nothing, and deceived [him] , and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate [armed with a spear]."
Luke,23,12,And the same day Pilate [armed with a spear] and Herod [heroic] were made friends together: for before they were at hatred (being an enemy) between themselves.
Luke,23,13,"And Pilate [armed with a spear] , when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,"
Luke,23,14,"Said unto them, You 2f have brought this man unto me, as one that perverts the people: and, behold, I, having examined [him] before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof you 2f accuse him:"
Luke,23,15,"No, nor yet Herod [heroic] : for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him."
Luke,23,16,"I will therefore chastise him, and release [him]."
Luke,23,17,(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
Luke,23,18,"And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this [man] , and release unto us Bar-Abba [son of a father]:"
Luke,23,19,"(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)"
Luke,23,20,"Pilate [armed with a spear] therefore, willing to release Yeshua [God is Salvation] , spoke again to them."
Luke,23,21,"But they cried, saying, Crucify [him] , crucify him."
Luke,23,22,"And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil has he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let [him] go."
Luke,23,23,"And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed."
Luke,23,24,And Pilate [armed with a spear] gave sentence that it should be as they required.
Luke,23,25,"And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Yeshua [God is Salvation] to their will."
Luke,23,26,"And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Shim’on [he has heard] , a Cyrenian [supremacy of the bridle] , coming out of the country, and on him they laid the stake (cross) , that he might bear [it] after Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
Luke,23,27,"And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him."
Luke,23,28,"But Yeshua [God is Salvation] turning unto them said, Daughters of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children."
Luke,23,29,"For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [are] the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which never gave suck."
Luke,23,30,"Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us."
Luke,23,31,"For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?"
Luke,23,32,"And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death."
Luke,23,33,"And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left."
Luke,23,34,"Then said Yeshua [God is Salvation] , Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his clothing, and cast lots."
Luke,23,35,"And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided [him] , saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Moshiach [Messiah] , the chosen of God-Theos."
Luke,23,36,"And the soldiers also deceived him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,"
Luke,23,37,"And saying, If you i be the king of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , save yourself."
Luke,23,38,"And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek [unstable: the miry one], and Latin, and ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] , THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Luke,23,39,"And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If you i be Moshiach [Messiah] , save yourself and us."
Luke,23,40,"But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Do not you i fear God-Theos, seeing you i are in the same condemnation?"
Luke,23,41,And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing amiss.
Luke,23,42,"And he said unto Yeshua [God is Salvation] , Lord - Kurios, remember me when you i come into your i kingdom."
Luke,23,43,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto him, Truly I say unto you i , To day shall you i be with me in paradise."
Luke,23,44,"And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour."
Luke,23,45,"And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst."
Luke,23,46,"And when Yeshua [God is Salvation] had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your i hands I commend my Spirit [Ruach] : and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."
Luke,23,47,"Now when the Centurion (Roman commander of an hundred men) saw what was done, he glorified God-Theos, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man."
Luke,23,48,"And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, struck their breasts, and returned."
Luke,23,49,"And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galil [circuit, district] , stood afar off, beholding these things."
Luke,23,50,"And, behold, [there was] a man named Yosef [God will add] , a counsellor; [and he was] a good man, and a just:"
Luke,23,51," (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) [he was] of Ramatayim [heights] , a city of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] : who also himself waited for the kingdom of God-Theos."
Luke,23,52,"This [man] went unto Pilate [armed with a spear] , and begged the body of Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
Luke,23,53,"And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was cut in stone, wherein never man before was laid."
Luke,23,54,"And that day was the preparation, and the Shabbat [rest] drew on."
Luke,23,55,"And the women also, which came with him from Galil [circuit, district] , followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid."
Luke,23,56,"And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Shabbat [rest] day according to the commandment."
Luke,24,1,"Now upon the first [day] of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain [others] with them."
Luke,24,2,And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
Luke,24,3,"And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
Luke,24,4,"And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:"
Luke,24,5,"And as they were afraid, and bowed down [their] faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek you 2f the living among the dead?"
Luke,24,6,"He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke unto you when he was yet in Galil [circuit, district],"
Luke,24,7,"Saying, The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again."
Luke,24,8,"And they remembered his words,"
Luke,24,9,"And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest."
Luke,24,10,"It was Miryam [waters of strength] Magdala [a tower] , and Yochanan [gift of God] , and Miryam [waters of strength] [the mother] of Ya’akov [heal-grabber] , and other [women that were] with them, which told these things unto the apostles."
Luke,24,11,"And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not."
Luke,24,12,"Then arose Kefa [pebble] , and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass."
Luke,24,13,"And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] [about] threescore furlongs."
Luke,24,14,And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
Luke,24,15,"And it came to pass, that, while they communed [together] and reasoned, Yeshua [God is Salvation] himself drew near, and went with them."
Luke,24,16,But their eyes were held that they should not know him.
Luke,24,17,"And he said unto them, What manner of communications [are] these that you 2f have one to another, as you 2f walk, and are sad?"
Luke,24,18,"And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Are you i only a stranger in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and have not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?"
Luke,24,19,"And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Yeshua [God is Salvation] of Natzeret [one separated] , which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God-Theos and all the people:"
