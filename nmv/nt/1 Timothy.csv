1 Timothy,1,1,"Sha’ul [desired] , an apostle of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] by the commandment of God-The Father our Saviour, and Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah], [which is] our hope;"
1 Timothy,1,2,"Unto Timothy [honoring God], [my] own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God-The Father our Father and Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] our Lord - Kurios."
1 Timothy,1,3,"As I besought you i to abide still at Ephesus [permitted] , when I went into Macedonia [extended land] , that you i might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,"
1 Timothy,1,4,"Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: [so do]."
1 Timothy,1,5,"Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and [of] a good conscience, and [of] faith unfeigned:"
1 Timothy,1,6,From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain quarreling (noisy arguement);
1 Timothy,1,7,"Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm."
1 Timothy,1,8,"But we know that the law [is] good, if a man use it lawfully;"
1 Timothy,1,9,"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and Profane (treat as common; defile) , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,"
1 Timothy,1,10,"For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;"
1 Timothy,1,11,"According to the glorious Gospel (joyful message) of the Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) God-The Father, which was committed to my trust."
1 Timothy,1,12,"And I thank Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] our Lord - Kurios, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;"
1 Timothy,1,13,"Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did [it] ignorantly in unbelief."
1 Timothy,1,14,And the grace of our Lord - Kurios was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation].
1 Timothy,1,15,"This [is] a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief."
1 Timothy,1,16,"However for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] might show forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting."
1 Timothy,1,17,"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God-The Father, [be] honour and glory forever and ever. Amen."
1 Timothy,1,18,"This charge I commit unto you i , son Timothy [honoring God] , according to the prophecies which went before on you i , that you i by them might war a good warfare;"
1 Timothy,1,19,"Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:"
1 Timothy,1,20,"Of whom is Hymenaeus [belonging to marriage] and Alexander [one who assists men] ; whom I have delivered unto Satan [the adversary] , that they may learn not to blaspheme."
1 Timothy,2,1,"I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, [and] giving of thanks, be made for all men;"
1 Timothy,2,2,"For kings, and [for] all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty."
1 Timothy,2,3,For this [is] good and acceptable in the sight of God-The Father our Saviour;
1 Timothy,2,4,"Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth."
1 Timothy,2,5,"For [there is] one God-The Father, and one mediator between God-The Father and men, the man Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation];"
1 Timothy,2,6,"Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time."
1 Timothy,2,7,"Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the tin Moshiach [Messiah], [and] lie not;) a teacher of the Goyim [Gentiles] in faith and truth."
1 Timothy,2,8,"I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting."
1 Timothy,2,9,"In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array (to put on; to clothe);"
1 Timothy,2,10,But (which becomes women professing godliness) with good works.
1 Timothy,2,11,Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
1 Timothy,2,12,"But I suffer (allow, to let, permit) not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence."
1 Timothy,2,13,"For Adam (Man, ground; red; earthling) was first formed, then Khav’vah [Eve] (to breath, to live)."
1 Timothy,2,14,"And Adam (Man, ground; red; earthling) was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression."
1 Timothy,2,15,"Yet she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety."
1 Timothy,3,1,"This [is] a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desires a good work."
1 Timothy,3,2,"A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;"
1 Timothy,3,3,"Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy profit; but patient, not a brawler (one who gets into fights) , not covetous;"
1 Timothy,3,4,"One that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;"
1 Timothy,3,5,"(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God-The Father?)"
1 Timothy,3,6,"Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil."
1 Timothy,3,7,Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach (disgrace; shame) and the snare of the devil.
1 Timothy,3,8,"Likewise [must] the deacons [be] grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy profit;"
1 Timothy,3,9,Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
1 Timothy,3,10,"And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being [found] blameless."
1 Timothy,3,11,"Even so [must] wives [be] grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things."
1 Timothy,3,12,"Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well."
1 Timothy,3,13,"For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
1 Timothy,3,14,"These things write I unto you i , hoping to come unto you i shortly:"
1 Timothy,3,15,"But if I wait long, that you i may know how you i ought to behave yourself in the house of God-The Father, which is the church of the living God-The Father, the pillar and ground of the truth."
1 Timothy,3,16,"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God-The Father was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit [Ruach] , seen of angels, preached unto the Goyim [Gentiles] , believed on in the world, received up into glory."
1 Timothy,4,1,"Now the Spirit [Ruach] speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of demons;"
1 Timothy,4,2,Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
1 Timothy,4,3,"Forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God-The Father has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth."
1 Timothy,4,4,"For every creature of God-The Father [is] good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:"
1 Timothy,4,5,For it is sanctified by the word of God-The Father and prayer.
1 Timothy,4,6,"If you i put the brethren in remembrance of these things, you i shall be a good minister of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto you i have attained."
1 Timothy,4,7,"But refuse Profane (treat as common; defile) and old wives’ fables, and exercise yourself [rather] unto godliness."
1 Timothy,4,8,"For bodily exercise profits for a little time: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come."
1 Timothy,4,9,This [is] a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
1 Timothy,4,10,"For therefore we both labour and suffer (allow, to let, permit) reproach (disgrace; shame) , because we trust in the living God-The Father, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe."
1 Timothy,4,11,These things command and teach.
1 Timothy,4,12,"Let no man despise your i youth; but be you i an example of the believers, in word, in Conversation (behavior; way of life; community) , in charity, in Spirit [Ruach] , in faith, in purity."
1 Timothy,4,13,"Till I come, give attendance to reading, to Exhortation (encouragement; counsel) , to doctrine."
1 Timothy,4,14,"Neglect not the gift that is in you i , which was given you i by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery (assembly of elders)."
1 Timothy,4,15,Meditate upon these things; give yourself wholly to them; that your i profiting may appear to all.
1 Timothy,4,16,"Take heed unto yourself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you i shall both save yourself, and them that hear you i."
1 Timothy,5,1,"Rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) not an elder, but intreat [him] as a father; [and] the younger men as brethren;"
1 Timothy,5,2,"The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity."
1 Timothy,5,3,Honour widows that are widows indeed.
1 Timothy,5,4,"But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to offer support for their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God-The Father."
1 Timothy,5,5,"Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God-The Father, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day."
1 Timothy,5,6,But she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.
1 Timothy,5,7,"And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless."
1 Timothy,5,8,"But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever."
1 Timothy,5,9,"Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,"
1 Timothy,5,10,"Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work."
1 Timothy,5,11,"But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to grow (become; advance) reckless against Moshiach [Messiah] , they will marry;"
1 Timothy,5,12,"Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith."
1 Timothy,5,13,"And withal they learn [to be] idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not."
1 Timothy,5,14,"I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully."
1 Timothy,5,15,For some are already turned aside after Satan [the adversary].
1 Timothy,5,16,"If any man or woman that believes have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed."
1 Timothy,5,17,"Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine."
1 Timothy,5,18,"For the scripture says, you i shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the corn. And, The labourer [is] worthy of his reward."
1 Timothy,5,19,"Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses."
1 Timothy,5,20,"Them that sin rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) before all, that others also may fear."
1 Timothy,5,21,"I charge [you i ] before God-The Father, and the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , and the elect angels, that you i observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality."
1 Timothy,5,22,"Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep yourself pure."
1 Timothy,5,23,"Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for your i stomach’s sake and your i often infirmities."
1 Timothy,5,24,"Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some [men] they follow after."
1 Timothy,5,25,Likewise also the good works [of some] are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
1 Timothy,6,1,"Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God-The Father and [his] doctrine be not blasphemed."
1 Timothy,6,2,"And they that have believing masters, let them not despise [them] , because they are brethren; but rather do [them] service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort."
1 Timothy,6,3,"If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, [even] the words of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;"
1 Timothy,6,4,"He is proud, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and strifes of words, whereof comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,"
1 Timothy,6,5,"Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw yourself."
1 Timothy,6,6,But godliness with contentment is great gain.
1 Timothy,6,7,"For we brought nothing into [this] world, [and it is] certain we can carry nothing out."
1 Timothy,6,8,And having food and clothing let us be with that content.
1 Timothy,6,9,"But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and [into] many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition."
1 Timothy,6,10,"For the love of money is a root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."
1 Timothy,6,11,"But you i , O man of God-The Father, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness."
1 Timothy,6,12,"Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you i are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses."
1 Timothy,6,13,"I give you i charge in the sight of God-The Father, who quickens all things, and [before] Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , who before Pontius Pilate [armed with a spear] witnessed a good confession;"
1 Timothy,6,14,"That you i keep [this] commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]:"
1 Timothy,6,15,"Which in his times he shall show, [who is] the Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord - Kurios of lords;"
1 Timothy,6,16,"Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom [be] honour and power everlasting. Amen."
1 Timothy,6,17,"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God-The Father, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;"
1 Timothy,6,18,"That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;"
1 Timothy,6,19,"Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life."
1 Timothy,6,20,"O Timothy [honoring God] , keep that which is committed to you i trust, avoiding Profane (treat as common; defile) [and] vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:"
1 Timothy,6,21,"Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace [be] with you i . Amen. <The first to Timothy [honoring God] was written from Laodicea [justice of the people] , which is the most important city of Phrygia [dry, barren] Pacatiana [dry; barren] .>"
