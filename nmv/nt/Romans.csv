Romans,1,1,"Sha’ul [desired] , a slave of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , called [to be] an apostle, separated unto the Gospel (joyful message) of God-The Father,"
Romans,1,2,"(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)"
Romans,1,3,"Concerning his Son Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] our Lord - Kurios, which was made of the seed of David [Beloved] according to the flesh;"
Romans,1,4,"And declared [to be] the Son of God-The Father with power, according to the Spirit [Ruach] of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:"
Romans,1,5,"By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:"
Romans,1,6,Among whom are you 2f also the called of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]:
Romans,1,7,"To all that be in Rome [strength] , beloved of God-The Father, called [to be] saints: Grace to you and peace from God-The Father our Father, and the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
Romans,1,8,"First, I thank my God-The Father through Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world."
Romans,1,9,"For God-The Father is my witness, whom I serve with my Spirit [Ruach] in the Gospel (joyful message) of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;"
Romans,1,10,"Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God-The Father to come unto you."
Romans,1,11,"For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end you 2f may be established;"
Romans,1,12,"That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me."
Romans,1,13,"Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but hinder (or obstruct) up to this time,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Goyim [Gentiles]."
Romans,1,14,"I am debtor both to the Greeks [unstable: miry ones] , and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise."
Romans,1,15,"So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the Gospel (joyful message) to you that are at Rome [strength] also."
Romans,1,16,"For I am not ashamed of the Gospel (joyful message) of Moshiach [Messiah] : for it is the power of God-The Father unto salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek [unstable: the miry one]."
Romans,1,17,"For in it is the righteousness of God-The Father revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith."
Romans,1,18,"For the wrath of God-The Father is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the tin unrighteousness;"
Romans,1,19,Because that which may be known of God-The Father is manifest in them; for God-The Father has showed [it] unto them.
Romans,1,20,"For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, [even] his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:"
Romans,1,21,"Because that, when they knew God-The Father, they glorified [him] not as God-The Father, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened."
Romans,1,22,"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,"
Romans,1,23,"And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God-The Father into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things."
Romans,1,24,"For what reason God-The Father also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:"
Romans,1,25,"Who changed the tof God-The Father into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) forever. Amen."
Romans,1,26,For this cause God-The Father gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
Romans,1,27,"And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is inappropriate, and receiving in themselves that recompence (punishment for evil, reward) of their error which was meet."
Romans,1,28,"And even as they did not like to retain God-The Father in [their] knowledge, God-The Father gave them over to a reprobate (rejected; failing the test; lost in sin) mind, to do those things which are not convenient (fit; appropriate; proper (one’s own; peculiar; particular));"
Romans,1,29,"Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,"
Romans,1,30,"Backbiters, haters of God-The Father, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,"
Romans,1,31,"Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable (cannot be calmed or appeased) , unmerciful:"
Romans,1,32,"Who knowing the judgment of God-The Father, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them."
Romans,2,1,"Therefore you i are inexcusable, O man, whosoever you i are that judge: for wherein you i judge another, you i condemn yourself; for you i that judge do the same things."
Romans,2,2,But we are sure that the judgment of God-The Father is according to tagainst them which commit such things.
Romans,2,3,"And think you i this, O man, that judge them which do such things, and do the same, that you i shall escape the judgment of God-The Father?"
Romans,2,4,Or despise you i the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God-The Father leads you i to repentance?
Romans,2,5,But after your i blindness and impenitent heart treasures up unto yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God-The Father;
Romans,2,6,Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
Romans,2,7,"To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:"
Romans,2,8,"But unto them that are contentious (loving to quarrel and angrily debate) , and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,"
Romans,2,9,"Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;"
Romans,2,10,"But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:"
Romans,2,11,For there is no respect of persons with God-The Father.
Romans,2,12,For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
Romans,2,13,"(For not the hearers of the law [are] just before God-The Father, but the doers of the law shall be justified."
Romans,2,14,"For when the Goyim [Gentiles] , which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:"
Romans,2,15,"Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and [their] thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)"
Romans,2,16,In the day when God-The Father shall judge the secrets of men by Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] according to my Gospel (joyful message).
Romans,2,17,"Behold, you i are called a Jewish person, and rests in the law, and makes your i boast of God-The Father,"
Romans,2,18,"And know [his] will, and approves the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;"
Romans,2,19,"And are confident that you i yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,"
Romans,2,20,"An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which have the form of knowledge and of the tin the law."
Romans,2,21,"you i therefore which teaches another, teaches you i not yourself? you i that preaches a man should not steal, do you i steal?"
Romans,2,22,"you i that say a man should not commit adultery, do you i commit adultery? you i that abhorrers idols, do you i commit sacrilege (violate or steal sacred things)?"
Romans,2,23,"you i that makes your i boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonour you i God-The Father?"
Romans,2,24,"For the name of God-The Father is blasphemed among the Goyim [Gentiles] through you, as it is written."
Romans,2,25,"For circumcision truly profits, if you i keep the law: but if you i be a breaker of the law, your i circumcision is made uncircumcision."
Romans,2,26,"Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?"
Romans,2,27,"And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge you i , who by the letter and circumcision do transgress the law?"
Romans,2,28,"For he is not a Jewish person, which is one outwardly; neither [is that] circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:"
Romans,2,29,"But he [is] a Jewish person, which is one inwardly; and circumcision [is that] of the heart, in the Spirit [Ruach], [and] not in the letter; whose praise [is] not of men, but of God-The Father."
Romans,3,1,What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit [is there] of circumcision?
Romans,3,2,"Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God-The Father."
Romans,3,3,For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God-The Father without effect?
Romans,3,4,"May it not be: yes, let God-The Father be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you i might be justified in your i sayings, and might overcome when you i are judged."
Romans,3,5,"But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God-The Father, what shall we say? [Is] God-The Father unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man)"
Romans,3,6,May it not be: for then how shall God-The Father judge the world?
Romans,3,7,For if the tof God-The Father has more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
Romans,3,8,"And not [rather], (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just."
Romans,3,9,"What then? are we better [than they] ? No, assuredly not (by no means) : for we have before proved both Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] and Goyim [Gentiles] , that they are all under sin;"
Romans,3,10,"As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"
Romans,3,11,"There is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God-The Father."
Romans,3,12,"They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one."
Romans,3,13,Their throat [is] an open sepulchre; with their tongues (foreign languages) they have used deceit; the poison of asps [is] under their lips:
Romans,3,14,Whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness:
Romans,3,15,Their feet [are] swift to shed blood:
Romans,3,16,Destruction and misery [are] in their ways:
Romans,3,17,And the way of peace have they not known:
Romans,3,18,There is no fear of God-The Father before their eyes.
Romans,3,19,"Now we know that what things soever the law says, it says to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God-The Father."
Romans,3,20,Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law [is] the knowledge of sin.
Romans,3,21,"But now the righteousness of God-The Father without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;"
Romans,3,22,Even the righteousness of God-The Father [which is] by faith of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
Romans,3,23,"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God-The Father;"
Romans,3,24,Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation]:
Romans,3,25,"Whom God-The Father has set forth [to be] a Propitiation (sacrifice to pay for sins against God, to satisfy His righteous anger) through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the forgiveness (pardon) of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God-The Father;"
Romans,3,26,"To declare, [I say] , at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
Romans,3,27,Where [is] boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.
Romans,3,28,Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
Romans,3,29," [Is he] the God-The Father of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] only? [is he] not also of the Goyim [Gentiles] ? Yes, of the Goyim [Gentiles] also:"
Romans,3,30,"Seeing [it is] one God-The Father, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith."
Romans,3,31,"Do we then make void the law through faith? May it not be: yes, we establish the law."
Romans,4,1,"What shall we say then that Avraham [Exalted Father] our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found?"
Romans,4,2,"For if Avraham [Exalted Father] were justified by works, he has [whereof] to glory; but not before God-The Father."
Romans,4,3,"For what says the scripture? Avraham [Exalted Father] believed God-The Father, and it was counted unto him for righteousness."
Romans,4,4,"Now to him that works is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt."
Romans,4,5,"But to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness."
Romans,4,6,"Even as David [Beloved] also describes the blessedness of the man, unto whom God-The Father imputes righteousness without works,"
Romans,4,7," [Saying] , Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [are] they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered."
Romans,4,8,Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [is] the man to whom the Lord - Kurios will not impiute (charge to one’s account; reckon) sin.
Romans,4,9," [Cometh] this blessedness then upon the circumcision [only] , or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Avraham [Exalted Father] for righteousness."
Romans,4,10,"How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision."
Romans,4,11,"And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had yet] being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:"
Romans,4,12,"And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Avraham [Exalted Father] , which [he had] being [yet] uncircumcised."
Romans,4,13,"For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, [was] not to Avraham [Exalted Father] , or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith."
Romans,4,14,"For if they which are of the law [be] heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:"
Romans,4,15,"Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, [there is] no transgression."
Romans,4,16,"Therefore [it is] of faith, that [it might be] by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Avraham [Exalted Father] ; who is the father of us all,"
Romans,4,17,"(As it is written, I have made you i a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, [even] God-The Father, who quickens the dead, and calls those things which be not as though they were."
Romans,4,18,"Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall your i seed be."
Romans,4,19,"And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah [princess] ’s womb:"
Romans,4,20,"He staggered not at the promise of God-The Father through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God-The Father;"
Romans,4,21,"And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to finish."
Romans,4,22,And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
Romans,4,23,"Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;"
Romans,4,24,"But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Yeshua [God is Salvation] our Lord - Kurios from the dead;"
Romans,4,25,"Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification."
Romans,5,1,"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God-The Father through our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]:"
Romans,5,2,"By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God-The Father."
Romans,5,3,"And not only [so] , but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation works patience;"
Romans,5,4,"And patience, experience; and experience, hope:"
Romans,5,5,And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God-The Father is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] which is given unto us.
Romans,5,6,"For when we were yet without strength, in due time Moshiach [Messiah] died for the ungodly."
Romans,5,7,For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die.
Romans,5,8,"But God-The Father commends his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Moshiach [Messiah] died for us."
Romans,5,9,"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."
Romans,5,10,"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God-The Father by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life."
Romans,5,11,"And not only [so] , but we also joy in God-The Father through our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , by whom we have now received the atonement."
Romans,5,12,"For what reason, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:"
Romans,5,13,(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
Romans,5,14,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam (Man, ground; red; earthling) to Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam (Man, ground; red; earthling) ’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come."
Romans,5,15,"But not as the offence, so also [is] the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God-The Father, and the gift by grace, [which is] by one man, Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , has abounded unto many."
Romans,5,16,"And not as [it was] by one that sinned, [so is] the gift: for the judgment [was] by one to condemnation, but the free gift [is] of many offences unto justification."
Romans,5,17,"For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] .)"
Romans,5,18,Therefore as by the offence of one [judgment came] upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one [the free gift came] upon all men unto justification of life.
Romans,5,19,"For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous."
Romans,5,20,"Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:"
Romans,5,21,"That as sin has reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] our Lord - Kurios."
Romans,6,1,"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?"
Romans,6,2,"May it not be. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer in it?"
Romans,6,3,"Know you 2f not, that so many of us as were baptized into Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] were baptized into his death?"
Romans,6,4,"Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Moshiach [Messiah] was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."
Romans,6,5,"For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also [in the likeness] of [his] resurrection:"
Romans,6,6,"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with [him] , that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from this time forth (from now on) we should not serve sin."
Romans,6,7,For he that is dead is freed from sin.
Romans,6,8,"Now if we be dead with Moshiach [Messiah] , we believe that we shall also live with him:"
Romans,6,9,Knowing that Moshiach [Messiah] being raised from the dead dies no more; death has no more dominion over him.
Romans,6,10,"For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he lives, he lives unto God-The Father."
Romans,6,11,"Likewise reckon you 2f also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God-The Father through Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] our Lord - Kurios."
Romans,6,12,"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you 2f should obey it in the lusts thereof."
Romans,6,13,"Neither yield you 2f your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God-The Father, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto God-The Father."
Romans,6,14,"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you 2f are not under the law, but under grace."
Romans,6,15,"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? May it not be."
Romans,6,16,"Know you 2f not, that to whom you 2f yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you 2f are to whom you 2f obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?"
Romans,6,17,"But God-The Father be thanked, that you 2f were the servants of sin, but you 2f have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you."
Romans,6,18,"Being then made free from sin, you 2f became the servants of righteousness."
Romans,6,19,I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you 2f have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.
Romans,6,20,"For when you 2f were the servants of sin, you 2f were free from righteousness."
Romans,6,21,What fruit had you 2f then in those things whereof you 2f are now ashamed? for the end of those things [is] death.
Romans,6,22,"But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God-The Father, you 2f have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life."
Romans,6,23,For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God-The Father [is] eternal life through Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] our Lord - Kurios.
Romans,7,1,"Know you 2f not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?"
Romans,7,2,"For the woman which has an husband is bound by the law to [her] husband so long as he lives; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of [her] husband."
Romans,7,3,"So then if, while [her] husband lives, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man."
Romans,7,4,"For what reason, my brethren, you 2f also are become dead to the law by the body of Moshiach [Messiah] ; that you 2f should be married to another, [even] to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God-The Father."
Romans,7,5,"For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death."
Romans,7,6,"But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of Spirit [Ruach] , and not [in] the oldness of the letter."
Romans,7,7,"What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? May it not be. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, you i shall not covet."
Romans,7,8,"But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence (strong lust; passion) . For without the law sin [was] dead."
Romans,7,9,"For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died."
Romans,7,10,"And the commandment, which [was ordained] to life, I found [to be] unto death."
Romans,7,11,"For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed [me]."
Romans,7,12,"For what reason the law [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."
Romans,7,13,"Was then that which is good made death unto me? May it not be. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful."
Romans,7,14,"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal (of the flesh, sensual) , sold under sin."
Romans,7,15,"For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I."
Romans,7,16,"If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that [it is] good."
Romans,7,17,"Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me."
Romans,7,18,"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but [how] to finish that which is good I find not."
Romans,7,19,"For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do."
Romans,7,20,"Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me."
Romans,7,21,"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me."
Romans,7,22,For I delight in the law of God-The Father after the inward man:
Romans,7,23,"But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."
Romans,7,24,O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
Romans,7,25,I thank God-The Father through Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] our Lord - Kurios. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God-The Father; but with the flesh the law of sin.
Romans,8,1," [There is] therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit [Ruach]."
Romans,8,2,For the law of the Spirit [Ruach] of life in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] has made me free from the law of sin and death.
Romans,8,3,"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God-The Father sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:"
Romans,8,4,"That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit [Ruach]."
Romans,8,5,For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit [Ruach] the things of the Spirit [Ruach].
Romans,8,6,For to be carnally minded [is] death; but to be spiritually minded [is] life and peace.
Romans,8,7,"Because the carnal (of the flesh, sensual) mind [is] hatred (being an enemy) against God-The Father: for it is not subject to the law of God-The Father, neither indeed can be."
Romans,8,8,So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God-The Father.
Romans,8,9,"But you 2f are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit [Ruach] , if so be that the Spirit [Ruach] of God-The Father dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit [Ruach] of Moshiach [Messiah] , he is none of his."
Romans,8,10,"And if Moshiach [Messiah] [be] in you, the body [is] dead because of sin; but the Spirit [Ruach] [is] life because of righteousness."
Romans,8,11,"But if the Spirit [Ruach] of him that raised up Yeshua [God is Salvation] from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Moshiach [Messiah] from the dead shall also make alive your mortal bodies by his Spirit [Ruach] that dwells in you."
Romans,8,12,"Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh."
Romans,8,13,"For if you 2f live after the flesh, you 2f shall die: but if you 2f through the Spirit [Ruach] do mortify (put to death; remove the life of) the deeds of the body, you 2f shall live."
Romans,8,14,"For as many as are led by the Spirit [Ruach] of God-The Father, they are the sons of God-The Father."
Romans,8,15,"For you 2f have not received the Spirit [Ruach] of bondage again to fear; but you 2f have received the Spirit [Ruach] of sonship, whereby we cry, Abba, Father."
Romans,8,16,"The Spirit [Ruach] itself bears witness with our Spirit [Ruach] , that we are the children of God-The Father:"
Romans,8,17,"And if children, then heirs; heirs of God-The Father, and joint-heirs with Moshiach [Messiah] ; if so be that we suffer (allow, to let, permit) with [him] , that we may be also glorified together."
Romans,8,18,For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time [are] not worthy [to be compared] with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
Romans,8,19,For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God-The Father.
Romans,8,20,"For the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected [the same] in hope,"
Romans,8,21,Because the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God-The Father.
Romans,8,22,For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.
Romans,8,23,"And not only [they] , but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit [Ruach] , even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the sonship, [that is to say] , the redemption of our body."
Romans,8,24,"For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?"
Romans,8,25,"But if we hope for that we see not, [then] do we with patience wait for [it]."
Romans,8,26,Likewise the Spirit [Ruach] also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit [Ruach] itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
Romans,8,27,"And he that searches the hearts knows what [is] the mind of the Spirit [Ruach] , because he makes intercession for the saints according to [the will of] God-The Father."
Romans,8,28,"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God-The Father, to them who are the called according to [his] purpose."
Romans,8,29,"For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren."
Romans,8,30,"Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified."
Romans,8,31,"What shall we then say to these things? If God-The Father [be] for us, who [can be] against us?"
Romans,8,32,"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"
Romans,8,33,Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God-The Father’s elect? [It is] God-The Father that justifies.
Romans,8,34,"Who [is] he that condemns? [It is] Moshiach [Messiah] that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God-The Father, who also makes intercession for us."
Romans,8,35,"Who shall separate us from the love of Moshiach [Messiah]? [shall] tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
Romans,8,36,"As it is written, For your i sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter."
Romans,8,37,"No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us."
Romans,8,38,"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor Principalities (rulers or their territory) , nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,"
Romans,8,39,"Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God-The Father, which is in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] our Lord - Kurios."
Romans,9,1,"I say the tin Moshiach [Messiah] , I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh],"
Romans,9,2,That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
Romans,9,3,"For I could wish that myself were accursed from Moshiach [Messiah] for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:"
Romans,9,4,"Who are Yisra’eli’s; to whom [pertains] the sonship, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service [of God-The Father] , and the promises;"
Romans,9,5,"Whose [are] the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Moshiach [Messiah] [came] , who is over all, God-The Father Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) forever. Amen."
Romans,9,6,"Not as though the word of God-The Father has taken none effect. For they [are] not all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] , which are of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God]:"
Romans,9,7,"Neither, because they are the seed of Avraham [Exalted Father], [are they] all children: but, In Yitz’khak [Laughter] shall your i seed be called."
Romans,9,8,"That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these [are] not the children of God-The Father: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed."
Romans,9,9,"For this [is] the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah [princess] shall have a son."
Romans,9,10,"And not only [this] ; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, [even] by our father Yitz’khak [Laughter];"
Romans,9,11,"(For [the children] being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God-The Father according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calls;)"
Romans,9,12,"It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger."
Romans,9,13,"As it is written, Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] [Heal of God] have I loved, but ‘Esav [Hairy] have I hated."
Romans,9,14,What shall we say then? [Is there] unrighteousness with God-The Father? May it not be.
Romans,9,15,"For he says to Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
Romans,9,16,"So then [it is] not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God-The Father that shows mercy."
Romans,9,17,"For the scripture says unto Par’oh [Pharaoh - Great House] , Even for this same purpose have I raised you i up, that I might show my power in you i , and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth."
Romans,9,18,"Therefore has he mercy on whom he will [have mercy] , and whom he will he hardens."
Romans,9,19,"you i will say then unto me, Why does he yet find fault? For who has resisted his will?"
Romans,9,20,"No but, O man, who are you i that replies against God-The Father? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed [it] , Why have you i made me thus?"
Romans,9,21,"Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?"
Romans,9,22," [What] if God-The Father, willing to show [his] wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:"
Romans,9,23,"And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,"
Romans,9,24,"Even us, whom he has called, not of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] only, but also of the Goyim [Gentiles]?"
Romans,9,25,"As he says also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved."
Romans,9,26,"And it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where it was said unto them, You 2f [are] not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God-The Father."
Romans,9,27,"Yesha’yahu [Yah is salvation] also cries concerning Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] , Though the number of the people of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:"
Romans,9,28,"For he will finish the work, and cut [it] short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord - Kurios make upon the earth."
Romans,9,29,"And as Yesha’yahu [Yah is salvation] said before, Except the Lord - Kurios of Tzva’ot [Lord - Kurios of the Armies of Israel] had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto ‘Amorah [a ruined heap]."
Romans,9,30,"What shall we say then? That the Goyim [Gentiles] , which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith."
Romans,9,31,"But Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] , which followed after the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness."
Romans,9,32,"For what reason? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;"
Romans,9,33,"As it is written, Behold, I lay in Tziyon [a parched place] a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believes on him shall not be ashamed."
Romans,10,1,"Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God-The Father for Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] is, that they might be saved."
Romans,10,2,"For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God-The Father, but not according to knowledge."
Romans,10,3,"For they being ignorant of God-The Father’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God-The Father."
Romans,10,4,For Moshiach [Messiah] [is] the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.
Romans,10,5,"For Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which does those things shall live by them."
Romans,10,6,"But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your i heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Moshiach [Messiah] down [from above])"
Romans,10,7,"Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Moshiach [Messiah] again from the dead.)"
Romans,10,8,"But what says it? The word is near you i, [even] in your i mouth, and in your i heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;"
Romans,10,9,"That if you i shall confess with your i mouth the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and shall believe in you i heart that God-The Father has raised him from the dead, you i shall be saved."
Romans,10,10,For with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
Romans,10,11,"For the scripture says, Whosoever believes on him shall not be ashamed."
Romans,10,12,For there is no difference between the Jewish person and the Greek [unstable: the miry one]: for the same Lord - Kurios over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
Romans,10,13,For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord - Kurios shall be saved.
Romans,10,14,How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
Romans,10,15,"And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Gospel (joyful message) of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!"
Romans,10,16,"But they have not all obeyed the Gospel (joyful message) . For Yesha’yahu [Yah is salvation] says, Lord - Kurios, who has believed our report?"
Romans,10,17,"So then faith [comes] by hearing, and hearing by the word of God-The Father."
Romans,10,18,"But I say, Have they not heard? Yes truly, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world."
Romans,10,19,"But I say, Did not Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] know? First Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] says, I will provoke you to jealousy by [them that are] no people, [and] by a foolish nation I will anger you."
Romans,10,20,"But Yesha’yahu [Yah is salvation] is very bold, and says, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me."
Romans,10,21,"But to Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] he says, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people."
Romans,11,1,"I say then, Has God-The Father cast away his people? May it not be. For I also am an Israeli, of the seed of Avraham [Exalted Father], [of] the tribe of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength]."
Romans,11,2,"God-The Father has not cast away his people which he foreknew. Knew (thought; supposed) you 2f not what the scripture says of Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] ? how he makes intercession to God-The Father against Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] , saying,"
Romans,11,3,"Lord - Kurios, they have killed your i prophets, and excavated down your i altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life."
Romans,11,4,"But what says the answer of God-The Father unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to [the image of] Ba’al [lord (a false god)]."
Romans,11,5,Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
Romans,11,6,"And if by grace, then [is it] no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if [it be] of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work."
Romans,11,7,"What then? Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] has not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded"
Romans,11,8,"(According as it is written, God-The Father has given them the Spirit [Ruach] of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day."
Romans,11,9,"And David [Beloved] says, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence (punishment for evil, reward) unto them:"
Romans,11,10,"Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back always."
Romans,11,11,"I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? May it not be: but [rather] through their fall salvation [is come] unto the Goyim [Gentiles] , for to provoke them to jealousy."
Romans,11,12,"Now if the fall of them [be] the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Goyim [Gentiles] ; how much more their fullness?"
Romans,11,13,"For I speak to you Goyim [Gentiles] , inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Goyim [Gentiles] , I magnify my office:"
Romans,11,14,"If by any means I may provoke to emulation (trying to equal or be better than others) [them which are] my flesh, and might save some of them."
Romans,11,15,"For if the casting away of them [be] the reconciling of the world, what [shall] the receiving [of them be] , but life from the dead?"
Romans,11,16,"For if the firstfruit [be] holy, the lump [is] also [holy] : and if the root [be] holy, so [are] the branches."
Romans,11,17,"And if some of the branches be broken off, and you i , being a wild olive tree, were graffed in among them, and with them partakes of the root and fatness of the olive tree;"
Romans,11,18,"Boast not against the branches. But if you i boast, you i bear not the root, but the root you i."
Romans,11,19,"you i will say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in."
Romans,11,20,"Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and you i stand by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:"
Romans,11,21,"For if God-The Father spared not the natural branches, [take heed] lest he also spare not you i."
Romans,11,22,"Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God-The Father: on them which fell, severity; but toward you i , goodness, if you i continue in [his] goodness: otherwise you i also shall be cut off."
Romans,11,23,"And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God-The Father is able to graff them in again."
Romans,11,24,"For if you i were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural [branches] , be graffed into their own olive tree?"
Romans,11,25,"For I would not, brethren, that you 2f should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you 2f should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] , until the fullness of the Goyim [Gentiles] be come in."
Romans,11,26,"And so all Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Tziyon [a parched place] the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] [Heal of God]:"
Romans,11,27,"For this [is] my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins."
Romans,11,28,"As concerning the Gospel (joyful message), [they are] enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, [they are] beloved for the fathers’ sakes."
Romans,11,29,For the gifts and calling of God-The Father [are] without repentance.
Romans,11,30,"For as you 2f in times past have not believed God-The Father, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:"
Romans,11,31,"Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy."
Romans,11,32,"For God-The Father has concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all."
Romans,11,33,"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God-The Father! how unsearchable [are] his judgments, and his ways past finding out!"
Romans,11,34,For who has known the mind of the Lord - Kurios? or who has been his counsellor?
Romans,11,35,"Or who has first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?"
Romans,11,36,"For of him, and through him, and to him, [are] all things: to whom [be] glory forever. Amen."
Romans,12,1,"I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God-The Father, that you 2f present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God-The Father, [which is] your reasonable service."
Romans,12,2,"And be not conformed to this world: but be you 2f transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you 2f may prove what [is] that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God-The Father."
Romans,12,3,"For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God-The Father has dealt to every man the measure of faith."
Romans,12,4,"For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:"
Romans,12,5,"So we, [being] many, are one body in Moshiach [Messiah] , and every one members one of another."
Romans,12,6,"Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith;"
Romans,12,7,"Or ministry, [let us wait] on [our] ministering: or he that teaches, on teaching;"
Romans,12,8,"Or he that exhorts, on Exhortation (encouragement; counsel) : he that gives, [let him do it] with simplicity; he that rules, with diligence; he that shows mercy, with cheerfulness."
Romans,12,9, [Let] love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; cleave (split open; cut open; divide) to that which is good.
Romans,12,10, [Be] kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
Romans,12,11,Not slothful in business; fervent in Spirit [Ruach] ; serving the Lord - Kurios;
Romans,12,12,Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
Romans,12,13,Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
Romans,12,14,"Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not."
Romans,12,15,"Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep."
Romans,12,16," [Be] of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits."
Romans,12,17,Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.
Romans,12,18,"If it be possible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men."
Romans,12,19,"Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but [rather] give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance [is] my; I will repay, says the Lord - Kurios."
Romans,12,20,"Therefore if your i enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing you i shall heap coals of fire on his head."
Romans,12,21,"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."
Romans,13,1,Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God-The Father: the powers that be are ordained of God-The Father.
Romans,13,2,"Whosoever therefore resists the power, resists the ordinance of God-The Father: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation."
Romans,13,3,"For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Will you i then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and you i shall have praise of the same:"
Romans,13,4,"For he is the minister of God-The Father to you i for good. But if you i do that which is evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God-The Father, a revenger to [execute] wrath upon him that does evil."
Romans,13,5,"For what reason [you 2f ] must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake."
Romans,13,6,"For for this cause pay you 2f tribute also: for they are God-The Father’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing."
Romans,13,7,Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute [is due] ; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
Romans,13,8,"Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law."
Romans,13,9,"For this, you i shall not commit adultery, you i shall not kill, you i shall not steal, you i shall not bear false witness, you i shall not covet; and if [there be] any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, you i shall love your i neighbour as yourself."
Romans,13,10,Love works no ill to his neighbour: therefore love [is] the fulfilling of the law.
Romans,13,11,"And that, knowing the time, that now [it is] high time to awake out of sleep: for now [is] our salvation nearer than when we believed."
Romans,13,12,"The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light."
Romans,13,13,"Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in lewdness (sexual indulgence) and wantonness, not in strife and envying."
Romans,13,14,"But put you 2f on the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , and make not provision for the flesh, to [fulfill] the lusts [thereof]."
Romans,14,1,"Him that is weak in the faith receive you 2f, [but] not to doubtful disputations."
Romans,14,2,"For one believes that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eats herbs."
Romans,14,3,Let not him that eats despise him that eats not; and let not him which eats not judge him that eats: for God-The Father has received him.
Romans,14,4,"Who are you i that judge another man’s slave? to his own master he stands or falls. Yes, he shall be held up: for God-The Father is able to make him stand."
Romans,14,5,One man esteems one day above another: another esteems every day [alike] . Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
Romans,14,6,"He that regards the day, regards [it] unto the Lord - Kurios; and he that regards not the day, to the Lord - Kurios he does not regard [it] . He that eats, eats to the Lord - Kurios, for he gives God-The Father thanks; and he that eats not, to the Lord - Kurios he eats not, and gives God-The Father thanks."
Romans,14,7,"For none of us lives to himself, and no man dies to himself."
Romans,14,8,"For whether we live, we live unto the Lord - Kurios; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord - Kurios: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord - Kurios’s."
Romans,14,9,"For to this end Moshiach [Messiah] both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord - Kurios both of the dead and living."
Romans,14,10,But why do you i judge your i brother? or why do you i set at nothing (despise) your i brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Moshiach [Messiah].
Romans,14,11,"For it is written, [As] I live, says the Lord - Kurios, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God-The Father."
Romans,14,12,So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God-The Father.
Romans,14,13,"Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in [his] brother’s way."
Romans,14,14,"I know, and am persuaded by the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , that [there is] nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteems any thing to be unclean, to him [it is] unclean."
Romans,14,15,"But if your i brother be grieved with [your i ] meat, now walk you i not charitably. Destroy not him with your i meat, for whom Moshiach [Messiah] died."
Romans,14,16,Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
Romans,14,17,"For the kingdom of God-The Father is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh]."
Romans,14,18,"For he that in these things serves Moshiach [Messiah] [is] acceptable to God-The Father, and approved of men."
Romans,14,19,"Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things which one may edify another."
Romans,14,20,For meat destroy not the work of God-The Father. All things indeed [are] pure; but [it is] evil for that man who eats with offence.
Romans,14,21," [It is] good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [any thing] whereby your i brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak."
Romans,14,22,Have you i faith? have [it] to yourself before God-The Father. Happy [is] he that condemns not himself in that thing which he allows.
Romans,14,23,"And he that doubts is judged if he eat, because [he eats] not of faith: for whatsoever [is] not of faith is sin."
Romans,14,24,"Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my Gospel (joyful message) , and the preaching of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,"
Romans,14,25,"But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God-The Father, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:"
Romans,14,26,"To God-The Father only wise, [be] glory through Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] forever. Amen. <Written to the Romans [strength] from Corinthus, [and sent] by Phebe [radiant] slave of the church at Cenchrea [millet] .>"
Romans,15,1,"We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves."
Romans,15,2,Let every one of us please [his] neighbour for [his] good to edification.
Romans,15,3,"For even Moshiach [Messiah] pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached you i fell on me."
Romans,15,4,"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope."
Romans,15,5,Now the God-The Father of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation]:
Romans,15,6,"That you 2f may with one mind [and] one mouth glorify God-The Father, even the Father of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
Romans,15,7,"For what reason receive you 2f one another, as Moshiach [Messiah] also received us to the glory of God-The Father."
Romans,15,8,"Now I say that Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] was a minister of the circumcision for the tof God-The Father, to confirm the promises [made] unto the fathers:"
Romans,15,9,"And that the Goyim [Gentiles] might glorify God-The Father for [his] mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to you i among the Goyim [Gentiles] , and sing unto your i name."
Romans,15,10,"And again he says, Rejoice, you 2f Goyim [Gentiles] , with his people."
Romans,15,11,"And again, Praise the Lord - Kurios, all you 2f Goyim [Gentiles] ; and laud him, all you 2f people."
Romans,15,12,"And again, Yesha’yahu [Yah is salvation] says, There shall be a root of Yishai [God’s gift] , and he that shall rise to reign over the Goyim [Gentiles] ; in him shall the Goyim [Gentiles] trust."
Romans,15,13,"Now the God-The Father of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you 2f may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh]."
Romans,15,14,"And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that you 2f also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another."
Romans,15,15,"Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God-The Father,"
Romans,15,16,"That I should be the minister of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] to the Goyim [Gentiles] , ministering the Gospel (joyful message) of God-The Father, that the offering up of the Goyim [Gentiles] might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh]."
Romans,15,17,I have therefore whereof I may glory through Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] in those things which pertain to God-The Father.
Romans,15,18,"For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Moshiach [Messiah] has not wrought by me, to make the Goyim [Gentiles] obedient, by word and deed,"
Romans,15,19,"Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit [Ruach] of God-The Father; so that from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the Gospel (joyful message) of Moshiach [Messiah]."
Romans,15,20,"Yes, so have I strived to preach the Gospel (joyful message) , not where Moshiach [Messiah] was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation:"
Romans,15,21,"But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand."
Romans,15,22,For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.
Romans,15,23,"But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;"
Romans,15,24,"Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way toward it by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your [company]."
Romans,15,25,But now I go unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to minister unto the saints.
Romans,15,26,For it has pleased them of Macedonia [extended land] and Achaia [trouble] to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace].
Romans,15,27,"It has pleased them truly; and their debtors they are. For if the Goyim [Gentiles] have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal (of the flesh, sensual) things."
Romans,15,28,"When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain."
Romans,15,29,"And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the Gospel (joyful message) of Moshiach [Messiah]."
Romans,15,30,"Now I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you, brethren, for the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit [Ruach] , that you 2f strive together with me in [your] prayers to God-The Father for me;"
Romans,15,31,That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Y’hudah [praised] ; and that my service which [I have] for Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] may be accepted of the saints;
Romans,15,32,"That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God-The Father, and may with you be refreshed."
