Philippians,1,1,"Sha’ul [desired] and Timothy [honoring God] , the servants of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , to all the saints in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] which are at Philippi [lover of horses] , with the bishops and deacons:"
Philippians,1,2,"Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God-The Father our Father, and [from] the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
Philippians,1,3,"I thank my God-The Father upon every remembrance of you,"
Philippians,1,4,"Always in every prayer of my for you all making request with joy,"
Philippians,1,5,For your fellowship in the Gospel (joyful message) from the first day until now;
Philippians,1,6,"Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a good work in you will finish [it] until the day of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]:"
Philippians,1,7,"Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel (joyful message) , you 2f all are partakers of my grace."
Philippians,1,8,"For God-The Father is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels (inward parts; affections) of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
Philippians,1,9,"And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and [in] all judgment;"
Philippians,1,10,That you 2f may approve things that are excellent; that you 2f may be sincere and without offence till the day of Moshiach [Messiah];
Philippians,1,11,"Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , unto the glory and praise of God-The Father."
Philippians,1,12,"But I would you 2f should understand, brethren, that the things [which happened] unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the Gospel (joyful message);"
Philippians,1,13,"So that my bonds in Moshiach [Messiah] are manifest in all the palace, and in all other [places];"
Philippians,1,14,"And many of the brethren in the Lord - Kurios, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear."
Philippians,1,15,Some indeed preach Moshiach [Messiah] even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:
Philippians,1,16,"The one preach Moshiach [Messiah] of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:"
Philippians,1,17,"But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the Gospel (joyful message)."
Philippians,1,18,"What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Moshiach [Messiah] is preached; and I in it do rejoice, yes, and will rejoice."
Philippians,1,19,"For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit [Ruach] of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah],"
Philippians,1,20,"According to my earnest expectation and [my] hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Moshiach [Messiah] shall be magnified in my body, whether [it be] by life, or by death."
Philippians,1,21,"For to me to live [is] Moshiach [Messiah] , and to die [is] gain."
Philippians,1,22,"But if I live in the flesh, this [is] the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I know not."
Philippians,1,23,"For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Moshiach [Messiah] ; which is far better:"
Philippians,1,24,Nevertheless to abide in the flesh [is] more needful for you.
Philippians,1,25,"And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;"
Philippians,1,26,That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] for me by my coming to you again.
Philippians,1,27,"Only let your Conversation (behavior; way of life; community) be as it becomes the Gospel (joyful message) of Moshiach [Messiah] : that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you 2f stand fast in one Spirit [Ruach] , with one mind striving together for the faith of the Gospel (joyful message);"
Philippians,1,28,"And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God-The Father."
Philippians,1,29,"For unto you it is given in the behalf of Moshiach [Messiah] , not only to believe on him, but also to suffer (allow, to let, permit) for his sake;"
Philippians,1,30,"Having the same conflict which you 2f saw in me, and now hear [to be] in me."
Philippians,2,1,"If [there be] therefore any consolation in Moshiach [Messiah] , if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit [Ruach] , if any bowels (inward parts; affections) and mercies,"
Philippians,2,2,"Fulfill you 2f my joy, that you 2f be likeminded, having the same love, [being] of one accord, of one mind."
Philippians,2,3, [Let] nothing [be done] through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
Philippians,2,4,"Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others."
Philippians,2,5,"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation]:"
Philippians,2,6,"Who, being in the form of God-The Father, thought it not robbery to be equal with God-The Father:"
Philippians,2,7,"But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a slave, and was made in the likeness of men:"
Philippians,2,8,"And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the stake (cross)."
Philippians,2,9,"For what reason God-The Father also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:"
Philippians,2,10,"That at the name of Yeshua [God is Salvation] every knee should bow, of [things] in heaven, and [things] in earth, and [things] under the earth;"
Philippians,2,11,"And [that] every tongue should confess that Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] [is] Lord - Kurios, to the glory of God-The Father the Father."
Philippians,2,12,"For what reason, my beloved, as you 2f have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
Philippians,2,13,For it is God-The Father which works in you both to will and to do of [his] good pleasure.
Philippians,2,14,Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
Philippians,2,15,"That you 2f may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God-The Father, without rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) , in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you 2f shine as lights in the world;"
Philippians,2,16,"Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Moshiach [Messiah] , that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain."
Philippians,2,17,"Yes, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all."
Philippians,2,18,"For the same cause also do you 2f joy, and rejoice with me."
Philippians,2,19,"But I trust in the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] to send Timothy [honoring God] shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state."
Philippians,2,20,"For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state."
Philippians,2,21,"For all seek their own, not the things which are Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] ’s."
Philippians,2,22,"But you 2f know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he has served with me in the Gospel (joyful message)."
Philippians,2,23,"Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me."
Philippians,2,24,But I trust in the Lord - Kurios that I also myself shall come shortly.
Philippians,2,25,"Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus [lovely] , my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants."
Philippians,2,26,"For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that you 2f had heard that he had been sick."
Philippians,2,27,"For indeed he was sick near unto death: but God-The Father had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow."
Philippians,2,28,"I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when you 2f see him again, you 2f may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful."
Philippians,2,29,Receive him therefore in the Lord - Kurios with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
Philippians,2,30,"Because for the work of Moshiach [Messiah] he was near unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me."
Philippians,3,1,"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord - Kurios. To write the same things to you, to me indeed [is] not grievous, but for you [it is] safe."
Philippians,3,2,"Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision (those who believe circumcision makes on righteous or saves)."
Philippians,3,3,"For we are the circumcision, which serve in [the] Spirit [Ruach] of God-The Father, and rejoice in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and have no confidence in the flesh."
Philippians,3,4,"Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:"
Philippians,3,5,"Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God], [of] the tribe of Binyamin [Son of the Right Hand/Strength] , an ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] of the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] ; as touching the law, a Pharisee [separatist];"
Philippians,3,6,"Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless."
Philippians,3,7,"But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Moshiach [Messiah]."
Philippians,3,8,"Yes doubtless, and I count all things [but] loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] my Lord - Kurios: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them [but] dung, that I may win Moshiach [Messiah],"
Philippians,3,9,"And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Moshiach [Messiah] , the righteousness which is of God-The Father by faith:"
Philippians,3,10,"That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;"
Philippians,3,11,If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
Philippians,3,12,"Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
Philippians,3,13,"Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but [this] one thing [I do] , forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,"
Philippians,3,14,I press toward the Mark [a defense] for the prize of the high calling of God-The Father in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation].
Philippians,3,15,"Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you 2f be otherwise minded, God-The Father shall reveal even this unto you."
Philippians,3,16,"Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing."
Philippians,3,17,"Brethren, be followers together of me, and Mark [a defense] them which walk so as you 2f have us for an example."
Philippians,3,18,"(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the stake (cross) of Moshiach [Messiah]:"
Philippians,3,19,"Whose end [is] destruction, whose God-The Father [is their] belly, and [whose] glory [is] in their shame, who mind earthly things.)"
Philippians,3,20,"For our citizenship is in heaven; from what place also we look for the Saviour, the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]:"
Philippians,3,21,"Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself."
Philippians,4,1,"Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord - Kurios, [my] dearly beloved."
Philippians,4,2,"I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) Euodias [fragrant] , and beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) Syntyche [with fate] , that they be of the same mind in the Lord - Kurios."
Philippians,4,3,"And I intreat you i also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the Gospel (joyful message) , with Clement also, and [with] other my fellowlabourers, whose names [are] in the book of life."
Philippians,4,4,"Rejoice in the Lord - Kurios always: [and] again I say, Rejoice."
Philippians,4,5,Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord - Kurios [is] at hand.
Philippians,4,6,Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God-The Father.
Philippians,4,7,"And the peace of God-The Father, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
Philippians,4,8,"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue (power) , and if [there be] any praise, think on these things."
Philippians,4,9,"Those things, which you 2f have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God-The Father of peace shall be with you."
Philippians,4,10,"But I rejoiced in the Lord - Kurios greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you 2f were also careful, but you 2f lacked opportunity."
Philippians,4,11,"Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, [with that] to be content."
Philippians,4,12,"I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer (allow, to let, permit) need."
Philippians,4,13,I can do all things through Moshiach [Messiah] which strengthens me.
Philippians,4,14,"Yet you 2f have well done, that you 2f did communicate with my affliction."
Philippians,4,15,"Now you 2f Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the Gospel (joyful message) , when I departed from Macedonia [extended land] , no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you 2f only."
Philippians,4,16,For even in Thessalonica [victory of falsity] you 2f sent once and again unto my necessity.
Philippians,4,17,Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
Philippians,4,18,"But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus [lovely] the things [which were sent] from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God-The Father."
Philippians,4,19,But my God-The Father shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation].
Philippians,4,20,Now unto God-The Father and our Father [be] glory forever and ever. Amen.
Philippians,4,21,Salute every saint in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] . The brethren which are with me greet you.
Philippians,4,22,"All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar [venerable] ’s household."
Philippians,4,23,"The grace of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] [be] with you all. Amen. <To [the] Philippians written from Rome [strength] , by Epaphroditus [lovely] .>"
