2 John,1,1,"The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;"
2 John,1,2,"For the truthâ€™s sake, which dwells in us, and shall be with us forever."
2 John,1,3,"Grace be with you, mercy, [and] peace, from God-The Father the Father, and from the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , the Son of the Father, in tand love."
2 John,1,4,"I rejoiced greatly that I found of your i children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father."
2 John,1,5,"And now I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i , lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto you i , but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another."
2 John,1,6,"And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as you 2f have heard from the beginning, you 2f should walk in it."
2 John,1,7,"For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist."
2 John,1,8,"Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward."
2 John,1,9,"Whosoever transgresses, and abides not in the doctrine of Moshiach [Messiah] , has not God-The Father. He that abides in the doctrine of Moshiach [Messiah] , he has both the Father and the Son."
2 John,1,10,"If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into [your] house, neither bid him God-The Father speed:"
2 John,1,11,For he that biddes him God-The Father speed is partaker of his evil deeds.
2 John,1,12,"Having many things to write unto you, I would not [write] with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full."
2 John,1,13,The children of your i elect sister greet you i . Amen.
