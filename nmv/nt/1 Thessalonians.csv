1 Thessalonians,1,1,"Sha’ul [desired] , and Silvanus (Silas) [woody] , and Timothy [honoring God] , unto the church of the Thessalonians [victory of falsity] [which is] in God-The Father the Father and [in] the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] : Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God-The Father our Father, and the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
1 Thessalonians,1,2,"We give thanks to God-The Father always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;"
1 Thessalonians,1,3,"Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , in the sight of God-The Father and our Father;"
1 Thessalonians,1,4,"Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God-The Father."
1 Thessalonians,1,5,"For our Gospel (joyful message) came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] , and in much assurance; as you 2f know what manner of men we were among you for your sake."
1 Thessalonians,1,6,"And you 2f became followers of us, and of the Lord - Kurios, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh]:"
1 Thessalonians,1,7,So that you 2f were examples (types) to all that believe in Macedonia [extended land] and Achaia [trouble].
1 Thessalonians,1,8,"For from you sounded out the word of the Lord - Kurios not only in Macedonia [extended land] and Achaia [trouble] , but also in every place your faith to God-The Father-ward (in custody, with a guard; prison) is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing."
1 Thessalonians,1,9,"For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how you 2f turned to God-The Father from idols to serve the living and true God-The Father;"
1 Thessalonians,1,10,"And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, [even] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , which delivered us from the wrath to come."
1 Thessalonians,2,1,"For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:"
1 Thessalonians,2,2,"But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you 2f know, at Philippi [lover of horses] , we were bold in our God-The Father to speak unto you the Gospel (joyful message) of God-The Father with much contention."
1 Thessalonians,2,3,"For our Exhortation (encouragement; counsel) [was] not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in deceit:"
1 Thessalonians,2,4,"But as we were allowed of God-The Father to be put in trust with the Gospel (joyful message) , even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God-The Father, which trieth our hearts."
1 Thessalonians,2,5,"For neither at any time used we flattering words, as you 2f know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God-The Father [is] witness:"
1 Thessalonians,2,6,"Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor [yet] of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Moshiach [Messiah]."
1 Thessalonians,2,7,"But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:"
1 Thessalonians,2,8,"So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the Gospel (joyful message) of God-The Father only, but also our own souls, because you 2f were dear unto us."
1 Thessalonians,2,9,"For you 2f remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the Gospel (joyful message) of God-The Father."
1 Thessalonians,2,10,"You 2f [are] witnesses, and God-The Father [also] , how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:"
1 Thessalonians,2,11,"As you 2f know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father [does] his children,"
1 Thessalonians,2,12,"That you 2f would walk worthy of God-The Father, who has called you unto his kingdom and glory."
1 Thessalonians,2,13,"For this cause also thank we God-The Father without ceasing, because, when you 2f received the word of God-The Father which you 2f heard of us, you 2f received [it] not [as] the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God-The Father, which effectually works also in you that believe."
1 Thessalonians,2,14,"For you 2f , brethren, became followers of the churches of God-The Father which in Y’hudah [praised] are in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] : for you 2f also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they [have] of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah]:"
1 Thessalonians,2,15,"Who both killed the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God-The Father, and are contrary to all men:"
1 Thessalonians,2,16,"Forbidding us to speak to the Goyim [Gentiles] that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost."
1 Thessalonians,2,17,"But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire."
1 Thessalonians,2,18,"For what reason we would have come unto you, even I Sha’ul [desired] , once and again; but Satan [the adversary] hindered us."
1 Thessalonians,2,19,"For what [is] our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? [Are] not even you 2f in the presence of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] at his coming?"
1 Thessalonians,2,20,For you 2f are our glory and joy.
1 Thessalonians,3,1,"For what reason when we could no longer refrain (restrain; refrein from acting) , we thought it good to be left at Athens [uncertainty] alone;"
1 Thessalonians,3,2,"And sent Timothy [honoring God] , our brother, and minister of God-The Father, and our fellowlabourer in the Gospel (joyful message) of Moshiach [Messiah] , to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:"
1 Thessalonians,3,3,That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
1 Thessalonians,3,4,"For truly, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer (allow, to let, permit) tribulation; even as it came to pass, and you 2f know."
1 Thessalonians,3,5,"For this cause, when I could no longer refrain (restrain; refrein from acting) , I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tried or tested you, and our labour be in vain."
1 Thessalonians,3,6,"But now when Timothy [honoring God] came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that you 2f have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also [to see] you:"
1 Thessalonians,3,7,"Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:"
1 Thessalonians,3,8,"For now we live, if you 2f stand fast in the Lord - Kurios."
1 Thessalonians,3,9,"For what thanks can we render to God-The Father again for you, for all the joy which we joy for your sakes before our God-The Father;"
1 Thessalonians,3,10,"Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?"
1 Thessalonians,3,11,"Now God-The Father himself and our Father, and our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , direct our way unto you."
1 Thessalonians,3,12,"And the Lord - Kurios make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all [men] , even as we [do] toward you:"
1 Thessalonians,3,13,"To the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God-The Father, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] with all his saints."
1 Thessalonians,4,1,"Furthermore then we beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you, brethren, and exhort [you] by the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , that as you 2f have received of us how you 2f ought to walk and to please God-The Father, [so] you 2f would abound more and more."
1 Thessalonians,4,2,For you 2f know what commandments we gave you by the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation].
1 Thessalonians,4,3,"For this is the will of God-The Father, [even] your sanctification, that you 2f should abstain from fornication:"
1 Thessalonians,4,4,That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;
1 Thessalonians,4,5,"Not in the lust of concupiscence (strong lust; passion) , even as the Goyim [Gentiles] which know not God-The Father:"
1 Thessalonians,4,6,"That no [man] go beyond and defraud his brother in [any] matter: because that the Lord - Kurios [is] the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified."
1 Thessalonians,4,7,"For God-The Father has not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness."
1 Thessalonians,4,8,"He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God-The Father, who has also given unto us his holy Spirit [Ruach]."
1 Thessalonians,4,9,But as touching brotherly love you 2f need not that I write unto you: for you 2f yourselves are taught of God-The Father to love one another.
1 Thessalonians,4,10,"And indeed you 2f do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia [extended land] : but we beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you, brethren, that you 2f increase more and more;"
1 Thessalonians,4,11,"And that you 2f study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;"
1 Thessalonians,4,12,"That you 2f may walk honestly toward them that are without, and [that] you 2f may have lack of nothing."
1 Thessalonians,4,13,"But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that you 2f sorrow not, even as others which have no hope."
1 Thessalonians,4,14,"For if we believe that Yeshua [God is Salvation] died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Yeshua [God is Salvation] will God-The Father bring with him."
1 Thessalonians,4,15,"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord - Kurios, that we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord - Kurios shall not precede them which are asleep."
1 Thessalonians,4,16,"For the Lord - Kurios himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God-The Father: and the dead in Moshiach [Messiah] shall rise first:"
1 Thessalonians,4,17,"Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord - Kurios in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord - Kurios."
1 Thessalonians,4,18,For what reason comfort one another with these words.
1 Thessalonians,5,1,"But of the times and the seasons, brethren, you 2f have no need that I write unto you."
1 Thessalonians,5,2,For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord - Kurios so comes as a thief in the night.
1 Thessalonians,5,3,"For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape."
1 Thessalonians,5,4,"But you 2f , brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief."
1 Thessalonians,5,5,"You 2f are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness."
1 Thessalonians,5,6,"Therefore let us not sleep, as [do] others; but let us watch and be sober."
1 Thessalonians,5,7,For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
1 Thessalonians,5,8,"But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation."
1 Thessalonians,5,9,"For God-The Father has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah],"
1 Thessalonians,5,10,"Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him."
1 Thessalonians,5,11,"For what reason comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also you 2f do."
1 Thessalonians,5,12,"And we beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord - Kurios, and admonish you;"
1 Thessalonians,5,13,And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. [And] be at peace among yourselves.
1 Thessalonians,5,14,"Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all [men]."
1 Thessalonians,5,15,"See that none render evil for evil unto any [man] ; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all [men]."
1 Thessalonians,5,16,Rejoice evermore.
1 Thessalonians,5,17,Pray without ceasing.
1 Thessalonians,5,18,In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God-The Father in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] concerning you.
1 Thessalonians,5,19,Quench not the Spirit [Ruach].
1 Thessalonians,5,20,Despise not prophesyings.
1 Thessalonians,5,21,but Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
1 Thessalonians,5,22,Abstain from all appearance of evil.
1 Thessalonians,5,23,And the very God-The Father of peace sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) you wholly; and [I pray God-The Father] your whole Spirit [Ruach] and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah].
1 Thessalonians,5,24,"Faithful [is] he that calls you, who also will do [it]."
1 Thessalonians,5,25,"Brethren, pray for us."
1 Thessalonians,5,26,Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.
1 Thessalonians,5,27,I charge you by the Lord - Kurios that this Epistle (important or formal letter) be read unto all the holy brethren.
1 Thessalonians,5,28,The grace of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] [be] with you. Amen. <[The first [Epistle (important or formal letter)] to the Thessalonians [victory of falsity] was written from Athens [uncertainty] .]>
