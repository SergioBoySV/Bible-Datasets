Ephesians,1,1,"Sha’ul [desired] , an apostle of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] by the will of God-The Father, to the saints which are at Ephesus [permitted] , and to the faithful in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation]:"
Ephesians,1,2,"Grace [be] to you, and peace, from God-The Father our Father, and [from] the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
Ephesians,1,3,"Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the God-The Father and Father of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , who has Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly [places] in Moshiach [Messiah]:"
Ephesians,1,4,"According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:"
Ephesians,1,5,"Having predestinated us unto the sonship of children by Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,"
Ephesians,1,6,"To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved."
Ephesians,1,7,"In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;"
Ephesians,1,8,Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
Ephesians,1,9,"Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:"
Ephesians,1,10,"That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Moshiach [Messiah] , both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; [even] in him:"
Ephesians,1,11,"In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:"
Ephesians,1,12,"That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Moshiach [Messiah]."
Ephesians,1,13,"In whom you 2f also [trusted] , after that you 2f heard the word of truth, the Gospel (joyful message) of your salvation: in whom also after that you 2f believed, you 2f were sealed with that holy Spirit [Ruach] of promise,"
Ephesians,1,14,"Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory."
Ephesians,1,15,"For what reason I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and love unto all the saints,"
Ephesians,1,16,"Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;"
Ephesians,1,17,"That the God-The Father of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , the Father of glory, may give unto you the Spirit [Ruach] of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:"
Ephesians,1,18,"The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you 2f may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,"
Ephesians,1,19,"And what [is] the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward (in custody, with a guard; prison) who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,"
Ephesians,1,20,"Which he wrought in Moshiach [Messiah] , when he raised him from the dead, and set [him] at his own right hand in the heavenly [places],"
Ephesians,1,21,"Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:"
Ephesians,1,22,"And has put all [things] under his feet, and gave him [to be] the head over all [things] to the church,"
Ephesians,1,23,"Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all."
Ephesians,2,1,"And you [has he quickened] , who were dead in trespasses and sins;"
Ephesians,2,2,"Wherein in time past you 2f walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the Spirit [Ruach] that now works in the children of disobedience:"
Ephesians,2,3,"Among whom also we all had our Conversation (behavior; way of life; community) in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others."
Ephesians,2,4,"But God-The Father, who is rich in mercy, for his great love which he loved us,"
Ephesians,2,5,"Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Moshiach [Messiah] , (by grace you 2f are saved;)"
Ephesians,2,6,"And has raised [us] up together, and made [us] sit together in heavenly [places] in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation]:"
Ephesians,2,7,That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in [his] kindness toward us through Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation].
Ephesians,2,8,For by grace are you 2f saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God-The Father:
Ephesians,2,9,"Not of works, lest any man should boast."
Ephesians,2,10,"For we are his workmanship, created in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] unto good works, which God-The Father has before ordained that we should walk in them."
Ephesians,2,11,"For what reason remember, that you 2f [being] in time past Goyim [Gentiles] in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;"
Ephesians,2,12,"That at that time you 2f were without Moshiach [Messiah] , being aliens from the commonwealth of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] , and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God-The Father in the world:"
Ephesians,2,13,But now in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] you 2f who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Moshiach [Messiah].
Ephesians,2,14,"For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition [between us];"
Ephesians,2,15,"Having abolished in his flesh the hatred (being an enemy), [even] the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, [so] making peace;"
Ephesians,2,16,"And that he might reconcile both unto God-The Father in one body by the stake (cross) , having slain the hatred (being an enemy) thereby:"
Ephesians,2,17,"And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were near."
Ephesians,2,18,For through him we both have access by one Spirit [Ruach] unto the Father.
Ephesians,2,19,"Now therefore you 2f are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God-The Father;"
Ephesians,2,20,"And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] himself being the chief corner [stone];"
Ephesians,2,21,In whom all the building fitly framed together grows unto an holy temple in the Lord - Kurios:
Ephesians,2,22,In whom you 2f also are built together for an habitation of God-The Father through the Spirit [Ruach].
Ephesians,3,1,"For this cause I Sha’ul [desired] , the prisoner of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] for you Goyim [Gentiles],"
Ephesians,3,2,"If you 2f have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God-The Father which is given me to you-ward (in custody, with a guard; prison):"
Ephesians,3,3,"How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,"
Ephesians,3,4,"Whereby, when you 2f read, you 2f may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Moshiach [Messiah])"
Ephesians,3,5,"Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit [Ruach];"
Ephesians,3,6,"That the Goyim [Gentiles] should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Moshiach [Messiah] by the Gospel (joyful message):"
Ephesians,3,7,"Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God-The Father given unto me by the effectual working of his power."
Ephesians,3,8,"Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Goyim [Gentiles] the unsearchable riches of Moshiach [Messiah];"
Ephesians,3,9,"And to make all [men] see what [is] the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God-The Father, who created all things by Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]:"
Ephesians,3,10,"To the intent that now unto the Principalities (rulers or their territory) and powers in heavenly [places] might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God-The Father,"
Ephesians,3,11,According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] our Lord - Kurios:
Ephesians,3,12,In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.
Ephesians,3,13,"For what reason I desire that you 2f give up not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory."
Ephesians,3,14,"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah],"
Ephesians,3,15,"Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,"
Ephesians,3,16,"That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit [Ruach] in the inner man;"
Ephesians,3,17,"That Moshiach [Messiah] may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you 2f , being rooted and grounded in love,"
Ephesians,3,18,"May be able to comprehend with all saints what [is] the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;"
Ephesians,3,19,"And to know the love of Moshiach [Messiah] , which passes knowledge, that you 2f might be filled with all the fullness of God-The Father."
Ephesians,3,20,"Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,"
Ephesians,3,21,"Unto him [be] glory in the church by Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] throughout all ages, world without end. Amen."
Ephesians,4,1,"I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord - Kurios, beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you that you 2f walk worthy of the vocation (what God calls, gifts a person to do) which you 2f are called,"
Ephesians,4,2,"With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;"
Ephesians,4,3,Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit [Ruach] in the bond of peace.
Ephesians,4,4," [There is] one body, and one Spirit [Ruach] , even as you 2f are called in one hope of your calling;"
Ephesians,4,5,"One Lord - Kurios, one faith, one baptism,"
Ephesians,4,6,"One God-The Father and Father of all, who [is] above all, and through all, and in you all."
Ephesians,4,7,But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Moshiach [Messiah].
Ephesians,4,8,"For what reason he says, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men."
Ephesians,4,9,"(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?"
Ephesians,4,10,"He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)"
Ephesians,4,11,"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;"
Ephesians,4,12,"For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Moshiach [Messiah]:"
Ephesians,4,13,"Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God-The Father, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Moshiach [Messiah]:"
Ephesians,4,14,"That we [from this time forth (from now on)] be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery (entrapment by deceit) of men, [and] cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;"
Ephesians,4,15,"But speaking the tin love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, [even] Moshiach [Messiah]:"
Ephesians,4,16,"From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love."
Ephesians,4,17,"This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord - Kurios, that you 2f from this time forth (from now on) walk not as other Goyim [Gentiles] walk, in the vanity of their mind,"
Ephesians,4,18,"Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God-The Father through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:"
Ephesians,4,19,"Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness (being lustful, loose or lewd; promoting lustful desires in others), to work all uncleanness with greediness."
Ephesians,4,20,But you 2f have not so learned Moshiach [Messiah];
Ephesians,4,21,"If so be that you 2f have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the tis in Yeshua [God is Salvation]:"
Ephesians,4,22,"That you 2f put off concerning the former Conversation (behavior; way of life; community) the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;"
Ephesians,4,23,And be renewed in the Spirit [Ruach] of your mind;
Ephesians,4,24,"And that you 2f put on the new man, which after God-The Father is created in righteousness and true holiness."
Ephesians,4,25,"For what reason putting away lying, speak every man twith his neighbour: for we are members one of another."
Ephesians,4,26,"Be you 2f angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:"
Ephesians,4,27,Neither give place to the devil.
Ephesians,4,28,"Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with [his] hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needs."
Ephesians,4,29,"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers."
Ephesians,4,30,"And grieve not the holy Spirit [Ruach] of God-The Father, whereby you 2f are sealed unto the day of redemption."
Ephesians,4,31,"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and yelling (loud complaining) , and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:"
Ephesians,4,32,"And be you 2f kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God-The Father for Moshiach [Messiah] ’s sake has forgiven you."
Ephesians,5,1,"Be you 2f therefore followers of God-The Father, as dear children;"
Ephesians,5,2,"And walk in love, as Moshiach [Messiah] also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God-The Father for a sweet smelling savour."
Ephesians,5,3,"But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;"
Ephesians,5,4,"Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient (fit; appropriate; proper (one’s own; peculiar; particular)) : but rather giving of thanks."
Ephesians,5,5,"For this you 2f know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Moshiach [Messiah] and of God-The Father."
Ephesians,5,6,Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things comes the wrath of God-The Father upon the children of disobedience.
Ephesians,5,7,Be not you 2f therefore partakers with them.
Ephesians,5,8,"For you 2f were sometimes darkness, but now [are you 2f ] light in the Lord - Kurios: walk as children of light:"
Ephesians,5,9,(For the fruit of the Spirit [Ruach] [is] in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
Ephesians,5,10,Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord - Kurios.
Ephesians,5,11,"And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove [them]."
Ephesians,5,12,For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
Ephesians,5,13,But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever does make manifest is light.
Ephesians,5,14,"For what reason he says, Awake you i that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Moshiach [Messiah] shall give you i light."
Ephesians,5,15,"See then that you 2f walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,"
Ephesians,5,16,"Redeeming the time, because the days are evil."
Ephesians,5,17,"For what reason be you 2f not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord - Kurios [is]."
Ephesians,5,18,"And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit [Ruach];"
Ephesians,5,19,"Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord - Kurios;"
Ephesians,5,20,Giving thanks always for all things unto God-The Father and the Father in the name of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah];
Ephesians,5,21,Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God-The Father.
Ephesians,5,22,"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord - Kurios."
Ephesians,5,23,"For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Moshiach [Messiah] is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body."
Ephesians,5,24,"Therefore as the church is subject unto Moshiach [Messiah] , so [let] the wives [be] to their own husbands in every thing."
Ephesians,5,25,"Husbands, love your wives, even as Moshiach [Messiah] also loved the church, and gave himself for it;"
Ephesians,5,26,"That he might sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,"
Ephesians,5,27,"That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish."
Ephesians,5,28,So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself.
Ephesians,5,29,"For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord - Kurios the church:"
Ephesians,5,30,"For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones."
Ephesians,5,31,"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh."
Ephesians,5,32,This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Moshiach [Messiah] and the church.
Ephesians,5,33,Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife [see] that she reverence [her] husband.
Ephesians,6,1,"Children, obey your parents in the Lord - Kurios: for this is right."
Ephesians,6,2,Honour your i father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)
Ephesians,6,3,"That it may be well with you i , and you i may live long on the earth."
Ephesians,6,4,"And, you 2f fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord - Kurios."
Ephesians,6,5,"Servants, be obedient to them that are [your] masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Moshiach [Messiah];"
Ephesians,6,6,"Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Moshiach [Messiah] , doing the will of God-The Father from the heart;"
Ephesians,6,7,"With good will doing service, as to the Lord - Kurios, and not to men:"
Ephesians,6,8,"Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord - Kurios, whether [he be] bond or free."
Ephesians,6,9,"And, you 2f masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him."
Ephesians,6,10,"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord - Kurios, and in the power of his might."
Ephesians,6,11,"Put [a bow] on the whole armour of God-The Father, that you 2f may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."
Ephesians,6,12,"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against Principalities (rulers or their territory) , against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against wicked spirits in high [places]."
Ephesians,6,13,"For what reason take unto you the whole armour of God-The Father, that you 2f may be able that is to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."
Ephesians,6,14,"Stand therefore, having your waist wrapped around about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;"
Ephesians,6,15,And your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel (joyful message) of peace;
Ephesians,6,16,"Above all, taking the shield of faith, which you 2f shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked."
Ephesians,6,17,"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit [Ruach] , which is the word of God-The Father:"
Ephesians,6,18,"Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit [Ruach] , and watching thereunthat is to sayh all perseverance and supplication for all saints;"
Ephesians,6,19,"And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the Gospel (joyful message),"
Ephesians,6,20,"For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak."
Ephesians,6,21,"But that you 2f also may know my affairs, [and] how I do, Tychicus [fateful] , a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord - Kurios, shall make known to you all things:"
Ephesians,6,22,"Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that you 2f might know our affairs, and [that] he might comfort your hearts."
Ephesians,6,23,"Peace [be] to the brethren, and love with faith, from God-The Father the Father and the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
Ephesians,6,24,"Grace [be] with all them that love our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] in with incorruption. Amen. <To [the] Ephesians [permitted] written from Rome [strength] , by Tychicus [fateful] .>"
