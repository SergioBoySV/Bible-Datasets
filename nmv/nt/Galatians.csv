Galatians,1,1,"Sha’ul [desired] , an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , and God-The Father the Father, who raised him from the dead;)"
Galatians,1,2,"And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia [land of the Galli, Gauls, A Celt]:"
Galatians,1,3,"Grace [be] to you and peace from God-The Father the Father, and [from] our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah],"
Galatians,1,4,"Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God-The Father and our Father:"
Galatians,1,5,To whom [be] glory forever and ever. Amen.
Galatians,1,6,I marvel that you 2f are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Moshiach [Messiah] unto another Gospel (joyful message):
Galatians,1,7,"Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the Gospel (joyful message) of Moshiach [Messiah]."
Galatians,1,8,"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other Gospel (joyful message) unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."
Galatians,1,9,"As we said before, so say I now again, If any [man] preach any other Gospel (joyful message) unto you than that you 2f have received, let him be accursed."
Galatians,1,10,"For do I now persuade men, or God-The Father? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the slave of Moshiach [Messiah]."
Galatians,1,11,"But I certify you, brethren, that the Gospel (joyful message) which was preached of me is not after man."
Galatians,1,12,"For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught [it] , but by the revelation of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
Galatians,1,13,"For you 2f have heard of my Conversation (behavior; way of life; community) in time past in the Y’hudit (Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] ’) religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God-The Father, and wasted it:"
Galatians,1,14,"And profited in the Y’hudit (Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah]’) religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers."
Galatians,1,15,"But when it pleased God-The Father, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called [me] by his grace,"
Galatians,1,16,"To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:"
Galatians,1,17,"Neither went I up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia [steppe-dwellers] , and returned again unto Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver]."
Galatians,1,18,"Then after three years I went up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] to see Kefa [pebble] [pebble] , and abode with him fifteen days."
Galatians,1,19,"But other of the apostles saw I none, save Ya’akov [heal-grabber] the Lord - Kurios’s brother."
Galatians,1,20,"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God-The Father, I lie not."
Galatians,1,21,Afterwards I came into the regions of Aram [exalted] (Syria [etymology is uncertain] ) and Cilicia [the land which rolls];
Galatians,1,22,And was unknown by face unto the churches of Y’hudah [praised] which were in Moshiach [Messiah]:
Galatians,1,23,"But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which once he destroyed."
Galatians,1,24,And they glorified God-The Father in me.
Galatians,2,1,"Then fourteen years after I went up again to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] with Bar-Nabba [son of rest] , and took Titus [nurse] with [me] also."
Galatians,2,2,"And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that Gospel (joyful message) which I preach among the Goyim [Gentiles] , but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain."
Galatians,2,3,"But neither Titus [nurse] , who was with me, being a Greek [unstable: the miry one], was compelled to be circumcised:"
Galatians,2,4,"And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , that they might bring us into bondage:"
Galatians,2,5,"To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the tof the Gospel (joyful message) might continue with you."
Galatians,2,6,"But of these who seemed to be somewhat (boasters) , (whatsoever they were, it makes no matter to me: God-The Father accepts no man’s person:) for they who seemed [to be somewhat] in conference added nothing to me:"
Galatians,2,7,"But contrariwise, when they saw that the Gospel (joyful message) of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as [the Gospel (joyful message)] of the circumcision [was] unto Kefa [pebble] [pebble];"
Galatians,2,8,"(For he that wrought effectually in Kefa [pebble] [pebble] to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Goyim [Gentiles] :)"
Galatians,2,9,"And when Ya’akov [heal-grabber] , Kefa [pebble] , and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Bar-Nabba [son of rest] the right hands of fellowship; that we [should go] unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision."
Galatians,2,10,Only [they would] that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.
Galatians,2,11,"But when Kefa [pebble] [pebble] was come to Antioch [speedy as a chariot] , I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed."
Galatians,2,12,"For before that certain came from Ya’akov [heal-grabber] , he did eat with the Goyim [Gentiles] : but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision."
Galatians,2,13,And the other Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] dissembled (used deceit; pretended; feigned) likewise with him; insomuch that Bar-Nabba [son of rest] also was carried away with their hypocrisy.
Galatians,2,14,"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the tof the Gospel (joyful message) , I said unto Kefa [pebble] [pebble] before [them] all, If you i , being a Jewish person, live after the manner of Goyim [Gentiles] , and not as do the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , why compelles you i the Goyim [Gentiles] to live as do the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah]?"
Galatians,2,15,"We [who are] Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] by nature, and not sinners of the Goyim [Gentiles],"
Galatians,2,16,"Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , even we have believed in Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , that we might be justified by the faith of Moshiach [Messiah] , and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified."
Galatians,2,17,"But if, while we seek to be justified by Moshiach [Messiah] , we ourselves also are found sinners, [is] therefore Moshiach [Messiah] the minister of sin? May it not be."
Galatians,2,18,"For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor."
Galatians,2,19,"For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God-The Father."
Galatians,2,20,"I am crucified with Moshiach [Messiah] : nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Moshiach [Messiah] lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God-The Father, who loved me, and gave himself for me."
Galatians,2,21,"I do not frustrate the grace of God-The Father: for if righteousness [come] by the law, then Moshiach [Messiah] is dead in vain."
Galatians,3,1,"O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you 2f should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] has been evidently set forth, crucified among you?"
Galatians,3,2,"This only would I learn of you, Received you 2f the Spirit [Ruach] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
Galatians,3,3,"Are you 2f so foolish? having begun in the Spirit [Ruach] , are you 2f now made perfect by the flesh?"
Galatians,3,4,Have you 2f suffered so many things in vain? if [it be] yet in vain.
Galatians,3,5,"He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit [Ruach] , and works miracles among you, [does he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
Galatians,3,6,"Even as Avraham [Exalted Father] believed God-The Father, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."
Galatians,3,7,"Know you 2f therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Avraham [Exalted Father]."
Galatians,3,8,"And the scripture, foreseeing that God-The Father would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the Gospel (joyful message) unto Avraham [Exalted Father], [saying] , In you i shall all nations be Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)."
Galatians,3,9,So then they which be of faith are Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) with faithful Avraham [Exalted Father].
Galatians,3,10,"For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them."
Galatians,3,11,"But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God-The Father, [it is] evident: for, The just shall live by faith."
Galatians,3,12,"And the law is not of faith: but, The man that does them shall live in them."
Galatians,3,13,"Moshiach [Messiah] has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that hangs on a tree:"
Galatians,3,14,That the blessing of Avraham [Exalted Father] might come on the Goyim [Gentiles] through Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit [Ruach] through faith.
Galatians,3,15,"Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though [it be] but a man’s covenant, yet [if it be] confirmed, no man disannulls, or adds thereto."
Galatians,3,16,"Now to Avraham [Exalted Father] and his seed were the promises made. He says not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your i seed, which is Moshiach [Messiah]."
Galatians,3,17,"And this I say, [that] the covenant, that was confirmed before of God-The Father in Moshiach [Messiah] , the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect."
Galatians,3,18,"For if the inheritance [be] of the law, [it is] no more of promise: but God-The Father gave [it] to Avraham [Exalted Father] by promise."
Galatians,3,19,"For what reason then [serves] the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator."
Galatians,3,20,"Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God-The Father is one."
Galatians,3,21," [Is] the law then against the promises of God-The Father? May it not be: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness should have been by the law."
Galatians,3,22,"But the scripture has concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] might be given to them that believe."
Galatians,3,23,"But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed."
Galatians,3,24,"For what reason the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Moshiach [Messiah] , that we might be justified by faith."
Galatians,3,25,"But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."
Galatians,3,26,For you 2f are all the children of God-The Father by faith in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation].
Galatians,3,27,For as many of you as have been baptized into Moshiach [Messiah] have put on Moshiach [Messiah].
Galatians,3,28,"There is neither Jewish [praised] people nor Greek [unstable: the miry one], there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you 2f are all one in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
Galatians,3,29,"And if you 2f [be] Moshiach [Messiah] ’s, then are you 2f Avraham [Exalted Father] ’s [Exalted Father] seed, and heirs according to the promise."
Galatians,4,1,"Now I say, [That] the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a slave, though he be lord of all;"
Galatians,4,2,But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.
Galatians,4,3,"Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:"
Galatians,4,4,"But when the fullness of the time was come, God-The Father sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,"
Galatians,4,5,"To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the sonship of sons."
Galatians,4,6,"And because you 2f are sons, God-The Father has sent forth the Spirit [Ruach] of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father."
Galatians,4,7,"For what reason you i are no more a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God-The Father through Moshiach [Messiah]."
Galatians,4,8,"However then, when you 2f knew not God-The Father, you 2f did service unto them which by nature are no gods."
Galatians,4,9,"But now, after that you 2f have known God-The Father, or rather are known of God-The Father, how turn you 2f again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you 2f desire again to be in bondage?"
Galatians,4,10,"You 2f observe days, and months, and times, and years."
Galatians,4,11,"I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain."
Galatians,4,12,"Brethren, I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you, be as I [am] ; for I [am] as you 2f [are] : you 2f have not injured me at all."
Galatians,4,13,You 2f know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the Gospel (joyful message) unto you at the first.
Galatians,4,14,"And my temptation which was in my flesh you 2f despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God-The Father, [even] as Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
Galatians,4,15,"Where is then the blessedness you 2f spoke of? for I bear you record, that, if [it had been] possible, you 2f would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me."
Galatians,4,16,"Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?"
Galatians,4,17,"They zealously affect you, [but] not well; yes, they would exclude you, that you 2f might affect them."
Galatians,4,18,"But [it is] good to be zealously affected always in [a] good [thing] , and not only when I am present with you."
Galatians,4,19,"My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Moshiach [Messiah] be formed in you,"
Galatians,4,20,"I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you."
Galatians,4,21,"Tell me, you 2f that desire to be under the law, do you 2f not hear the law?"
Galatians,4,22,"For it is written, that Avraham [Exalted Father] had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman."
Galatians,4,23,But he [who was] of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman [was] by promise.
Galatians,4,24,"Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar."
Galatians,4,25,"For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia [steppe-dwellers] , and answer to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] which now is, and is in bondage with her children."
Galatians,4,26,"But Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] which is above is free, which is the mother of us all."
Galatians,4,27,"For it is written, Rejoice, [you i ] barren that bear not; break forth and cry, you i that travaile not: for the desolate has many more children than she which has an husband."
Galatians,4,28,"Now we, brethren, as Yitz’khak [Laughter] was, are the children of promise."
Galatians,4,29,"But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the Spirit [Ruach] , even so [it is] now."
Galatians,4,30,Nevertheless what says the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
Galatians,4,31,"So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free."
Galatians,5,1,"Stand fast therefore in the liberty which Moshiach [Messiah] has made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."
Galatians,5,2,"Behold, I Sha’ul [desired] say unto you, that if you 2f be circumcised, Moshiach [Messiah] shall profit you nothing."
Galatians,5,3,"For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law."
Galatians,5,4,"Moshiach [Messiah] is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; you 2f are fallen from grace."
Galatians,5,5,For we through the Spirit [Ruach] wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
Galatians,5,6,"For in Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love."
Galatians,5,7,You 2f did run well; who did hinder you that you 2f should not obey the truth?
Galatians,5,8,This persuasion [comes] not of him that calls you.
Galatians,5,9,A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
Galatians,5,10,"I have confidence in you through the Lord - Kurios, that you 2f will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubles you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be."
Galatians,5,11,"And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer (allow, to let, permit) persecution? then is the offence of the stake (cross) ceased."
Galatians,5,12,I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
Galatians,5,13,"For, brethren, you 2f have been called unto liberty; only [use] not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another."
Galatians,5,14,"For all the law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this; you i shall love your i neighbour as yourself."
Galatians,5,15,"But if you 2f bite and devour one another, take heed that you 2f be not consumed one of another."
Galatians,5,16," [This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit [Ruach] , and you 2f shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh."
Galatians,5,17,"For the flesh lusts against the Spirit [Ruach] , and the Spirit [Ruach] against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you 2f cannot do the things that you 2f would."
Galatians,5,18,"But if you 2f be led of the Spirit [Ruach] , you 2f are not under the law."
Galatians,5,19,"Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these] ; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness (being lustful, loose or lewd; promoting lustful desires in others),"
Galatians,5,20,"Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, disagreement (dissension) , emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,"
Galatians,5,21,"Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told [you] in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God-The Father."
Galatians,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit [Ruach] is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,"
Galatians,5,23,"Meekness, self-control: against such there is no law."
Galatians,5,24,And they that are Moshiach [Messiah] ’s have crucified the flesh with the passions and lusts.
Galatians,5,25,"If we live in the Spirit [Ruach] , let us also walk in the Spirit [Ruach]."
Galatians,5,26,"Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another."
Galatians,6,1,"Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you 2f which are spiritual, restore such an one in the Spirit [Ruach] of meekness; considering yourself, lest you i also be tried or tested."
Galatians,6,2,"Bear you 2f one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Moshiach [Messiah]."
Galatians,6,3,"For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself."
Galatians,6,4,"But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another."
Galatians,6,5,For every man shall bear his own burden.
Galatians,6,6,Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teaches in all good things.
Galatians,6,7,"Be not deceived; God-The Father is not deceived: for whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap."
Galatians,6,8,For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit [Ruach] shall of the Spirit [Ruach] reap life everlasting.
Galatians,6,9,"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we give up not."
Galatians,6,10,"As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men] , especially unto them who are of the household of faith."
Galatians,6,11,You 2f see how large a letter I have written unto you with my own hand.
Galatians,6,12,"As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain (compel with irresistible force) you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer (allow, to let, permit) persecution for the stake (cross) of Moshiach [Messiah]."
Galatians,6,13,"For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh."
Galatians,6,14,"But May it not be that I should glory, save in the stake (cross) of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world."
Galatians,6,15,"For in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation."
Galatians,6,16,"And as many as walk according to this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy, and upon the Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] of God-The Father."
Galatians,6,17,From from this time forth (from now on) let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation].
Galatians,6,18,"Brethren, the grace of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] [be] with your Spirit [Ruach] . Amen. <Unto the Galatians written from Rome [strength] .>"
