1 Corinthians,1,1,"Sha’ul [desired] , called [to be] an apostle of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] through the will of God-The Father, and Sosthenes [saviour of his nation] [our] brother,"
1 Corinthians,1,2,"Unto the church of God-The Father which is at Corinth [satiated] , to them that are sanctified in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , called [to be] saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] our Lord - Kurios, both theirs and ours:"
1 Corinthians,1,3,"Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God-The Father our Father, and [from] the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
1 Corinthians,1,4,"I thank my God-The Father always on your behalf, for the grace of God-The Father which is given you by Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah];"
1 Corinthians,1,5,"That in every thing you 2f are enriched by him, in all utterance, and [in] all knowledge;"
1 Corinthians,1,6,Even as the testimony of Moshiach [Messiah] was confirmed in you:
1 Corinthians,1,7,So that you 2f come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]:
1 Corinthians,1,8,"Who shall also confirm you unto the end, [that you 2f may be] blameless in the day of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
1 Corinthians,1,9,"God-The Father [is] faithful, by whom you 2f were called unto the fellowship of his Son Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] our Lord - Kurios."
1 Corinthians,1,10,"Now I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you, brethren, by the name of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , that you 2f all speak the same thing, and [that] there be no divisions among you; but [that] you 2f be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."
1 Corinthians,1,11,"For it has been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them [which are of the house] of Chloe, that there are contentions among you."
1 Corinthians,1,12,"Now this I say, that every one of you says, I am of Sha’ul [desired] ; and I of Apollos [given by Apollo (etymology uncertain)] ; and I of Kefa [pebble] ; and I of Moshiach [Messiah]."
1 Corinthians,1,13,Is Moshiach [Messiah] divided? was Sha’ul [desired] crucified for you? or were you 2f baptized in the name of Sha’ul [desired]?
1 Corinthians,1,14,"I thank God-The Father that I baptized none of you, but Crispus [curled] and Gaius [lord];"
1 Corinthians,1,15,Lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name.
1 Corinthians,1,16,"And I baptized also the household of Stephanas [crowned] : besides, I know not whether I baptized any other."
1 Corinthians,1,17,"For Moshiach [Messiah] sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel (joyful message) : not with wisdom of words, lest the stake (cross) of Moshiach [Messiah] should be made of none effect."
1 Corinthians,1,18,For the preaching of the stake (cross) is to them that are perishing foolishness; but unto us which are being saved it is the power of God-The Father.
1 Corinthians,1,19,"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."
1 Corinthians,1,20,Where [is] the wise? where [is] the scribe? where [is] the disputer of this world? has not God-The Father made foolish the wisdom of this world?
1 Corinthians,1,21,"For after that in the wisdom of God-The Father the world by wisdom knew not God-The Father, it pleased God-The Father by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."
1 Corinthians,1,22,"For the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] require a sign, and the Greeks [unstable: miry ones] seek after wisdom:"
1 Corinthians,1,23,"But we preach Moshiach [Messiah] crucified, unto the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks [unstable: miry ones] foolishness;"
1 Corinthians,1,24,"But unto them which are called, both Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] and Greeks [unstable: miry ones], Moshiach [Messiah] the power of God-The Father, and the wisdom of God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,1,25,Because the foolishness of God-The Father is wiser than men; and the weakness of God-The Father is stronger than men.
1 Corinthians,1,26,"For you 2f see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, [are called]:"
1 Corinthians,1,27,But God-The Father has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God-The Father has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
1 Corinthians,1,28,"And base things of the world, and things which are despised, has God-The Father chosen, [yes] , and things which are not, to bring to nothing things that are:"
1 Corinthians,1,29,That no flesh should glory in his presence.
1 Corinthians,1,30,"But of him are you 2f in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , who of God-The Father is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:"
1 Corinthians,1,31,"That, according as it is written, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord - Kurios."
1 Corinthians,2,1,"And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,2,2,"For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , and him crucified."
1 Corinthians,2,3,"And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling."
1 Corinthians,2,4,"And my speech and my preaching [was] not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit [Ruach] and of power:"
1 Corinthians,2,5,"That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,2,6,"However we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:"
1 Corinthians,2,7,"But we speak the wisdom of God-The Father in a mystery, [even] the hidden [wisdom] , which God-The Father ordained before the world unto our glory:"
1 Corinthians,2,8,"Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known [it] , they would not have crucified the Lord - Kurios of glory."
1 Corinthians,2,9,"But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God-The Father has prepared for them that love him."
1 Corinthians,2,10,"But God-The Father has revealed [them] unto us by his Spirit [Ruach] : for the Spirit [Ruach] searches all things, yes, the deep things of God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,2,11,"For what man knows the things of a man, save the Spirit [Ruach] of man which is in him? even so the things of God-The Father knows no man, but the Spirit [Ruach] of God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,2,12,"Now we have received, not the Spirit [Ruach] of the world, but the Spirit [Ruach] which is of God-The Father; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,2,13,"Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] teaches; comparing spiritual things with spiritual."
1 Corinthians,2,14,"But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit [Ruach] of God-The Father: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know [them] , because they are spiritually discerned."
1 Corinthians,2,15,"But he that is spiritual all things, yet he himself is judged of no man."
1 Corinthians,2,16,"For who has known the mind of the Lord - Kurios, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Moshiach [Messiah]."
1 Corinthians,3,1,"And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal (of the flesh, sensual), [even] as unto babes in Moshiach [Messiah]."
1 Corinthians,3,2,"I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for up to this time you 2f were not able [to bear it] , neither yet now are you 2f able."
1 Corinthians,3,3,"For you 2f are yet carnal (of the flesh, sensual) : for whereas [there is] among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you 2f not carnal (of the flesh, sensual) , and walk as men?"
1 Corinthians,3,4,"For while one says, I am of Sha’ul [desired] ; and another, I [am] of Apollos [given by Apollo (etymology uncertain)] ; are you 2f not carnal (of the flesh, sensual)?"
1 Corinthians,3,5,"Who then is Sha’ul [desired] , and who [is] Apollos [given by Apollo (etymology uncertain)] , but ministers by whom you 2f believed, even as the Lord - Kurios gave to every man?"
1 Corinthians,3,6,"I have planted, Apollos [given by Apollo (etymology uncertain)] watered; but God-The Father gave the increase."
1 Corinthians,3,7,"So then neither is he that plants any thing, neither he that waters; but God-The Father that gives the increase."
1 Corinthians,3,8,Now he that plants and he that waters are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
1 Corinthians,3,9,"For we are labourers together with God-The Father: you 2f are God-The Father’s husbandry, [you 2f are] God-The Father’s building."
1 Corinthians,3,10,"According to the grace of God-The Father which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon."
1 Corinthians,3,11,"For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
1 Corinthians,3,12,"Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;"
1 Corinthians,3,13,"Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is."
1 Corinthians,3,14,"If any man’s work abide which he has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward."
1 Corinthians,3,15,"If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer (allow, to let, permit) loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire."
1 Corinthians,3,16,"Know you 2f not that you 2f are the temple of God-The Father, and [that] the Spirit [Ruach] of God-The Father dwells in you?"
1 Corinthians,3,17,"If any man defile the temple of God-The Father, him shall God-The Father destroy; for the temple of God-The Father is holy, which [temple] you 2f are."
1 Corinthians,3,18,"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise."
1 Corinthians,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God-The Father. For it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness."
1 Corinthians,3,20,"And again, The Lord - Kurios knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain."
1 Corinthians,3,21,Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;
1 Corinthians,3,22,"Whether Sha’ul [desired] , or Apollos [given by Apollo (etymology uncertain)] , or Kefa [pebble] , or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;"
1 Corinthians,3,23,And you 2f are Moshiach [Messiah] ’s; and Moshiach [Messiah] [is] God-The Father’s.
1 Corinthians,4,1,"Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Moshiach [Messiah] , and stewards of the mysteries of God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,4,2,"Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful."
1 Corinthians,4,3,"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yes, I judge not my own self."
1 Corinthians,4,4,For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that me is the Lord - Kurios.
1 Corinthians,4,5,"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord - Kurios come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,4,6,"And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and [to] Apollos [given by Apollo (etymology uncertain)] for your sakes; that you 2f might learn in us not to think [of men] above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another."
1 Corinthians,4,7,"For who makes you i to differ [from another] ? and what have you i that you i did not receive? now if you i did receive [it] , why do you i glory, as if you i had not received [it]?"
1 Corinthians,4,8,"Now you 2f are full, now you 2f are rich, you 2f have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God-The Father you 2f did reign, that we also might reign with you."
1 Corinthians,4,9,"For I think that God-The Father has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men."
1 Corinthians,4,10,"We [are] fools for Moshiach [Messiah] ’s sake, but you 2f [are] wise in Moshiach [Messiah] ; we [are] weak, but you 2f [are] strong; you 2f [are] honourable, but we [are] despised."
1 Corinthians,4,11,"Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;"
1 Corinthians,4,12,"And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer (allow, to let, permit) it:"
1 Corinthians,4,13,"Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, [and are] the outcast of all things unto this day."
1 Corinthians,4,14,"I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn [you]."
1 Corinthians,4,15,"For though you 2f have ten thousand instructors in Moshiach [Messiah] , yet [have you 2f ] not many fathers: for in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] I have begotten you through the Gospel (joyful message)."
1 Corinthians,4,16,"For what reason I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you, be you 2f followers of me."
1 Corinthians,4,17,"For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy [honoring God] , who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord - Kurios, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Moshiach [Messiah] , as I teach every where in every church."
1 Corinthians,4,18,"Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you."
1 Corinthians,4,19,"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord - Kurios will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power."
1 Corinthians,4,20,"For the kingdom of God-The Father [is] not in word, but in power."
1 Corinthians,4,21,"What will you 2f ? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and [in] the Spirit [Ruach] of meekness?"
1 Corinthians,5,1,"It is reported commonly [that there is] fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Goyim [Gentiles] , that one should have his father’s wife."
1 Corinthians,5,2,"And you 2f are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you."
1 Corinthians,5,3,"For I truly, as absent in body, but present in Spirit [Ruach] , have judged already, as though I were present, [concerning] him that has so done this deed,"
1 Corinthians,5,4,"In the name of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , when you 2f are gathered together, and my Spirit [Ruach] , with the power of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah],"
1 Corinthians,5,5,"To deliver such an one unto Satan [the adversary] for the destruction of the flesh, that the Spirit [Ruach] may be saved in the day of the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
1 Corinthians,5,6,Your glorying [is] not good. Know you 2f not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
1 Corinthians,5,7,"Purge out therefore the old leaven, that you 2f may be a new lump, as you 2f are unleavened. For even Moshiach [Messiah] our Passover is sacrificed for us:"
1 Corinthians,5,8,"Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened [bread] of with incorruption and truth."
1 Corinthians,5,9,I wrote unto you in an Epistle (important or formal letter) not to company with fornicators:
1 Corinthians,5,10,"Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must you 2f needs go out of the world."
1 Corinthians,5,11,"But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat."
1 Corinthians,5,12,For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not you 2f judge them that are within?
1 Corinthians,5,13,But them that are without God-The Father judges. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
1 Corinthians,6,1,"Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?"
1 Corinthians,6,2,"Do you 2f not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are you 2f unworthy to judge the smallest matters?"
1 Corinthians,6,3,Know you 2f not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?
1 Corinthians,6,4,"If then you 2f have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church."
1 Corinthians,6,5,"I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?"
1 Corinthians,6,6,"But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers."
1 Corinthians,6,7,"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because you 2f go to law one with another. Why do you 2f not rather take wrong? why do you 2f not rather [suffer (allow, to let, permit) yourselves to] be defrauded?"
1 Corinthians,6,8,"No, you 2f do wrong, and defraud, and that [your] brethren."
1 Corinthians,6,9,"Know you 2f not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God-The Father? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate (acting like a woman; unmanly) , nor abusers of themselves with mankind,"
1 Corinthians,6,10,"Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,6,11,"And such were some of you: but you 2f are washed, but you 2f are sanctified, but you 2f are justified in the name of the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and by the Spirit [Ruach] of our God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,6,12,"All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any."
1 Corinthians,6,13,"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God-The Father shall destroy both it and them. Now the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord - Kurios; and the Lord - Kurios for the body."
1 Corinthians,6,14,"And God-The Father has both raised up the Lord - Kurios, and will also raise up us by his own power."
1 Corinthians,6,15,"Know you 2f not that your bodies are the members of Moshiach [Messiah] ? shall I then take the members of Moshiach [Messiah] , and make [them] the members of an prostitute? May it not be."
1 Corinthians,6,16,"What? know you 2f not that he which is joined to an prostitute is one body? for two, says he, shall be one flesh."
1 Corinthians,6,17,But he that is joined unto the Lord - Kurios is one Spirit [Ruach].
1 Corinthians,6,18,Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is without the body; but he that commit fornication sins against his own body.
1 Corinthians,6,19,"What? know you 2f not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] [which is] in you, which you 2f have of God-The Father, and you 2f are not your own?"
1 Corinthians,6,20,"For you 2f are bought with a price: therefore glorify God-The Father in your body, and in your Spirit [Ruach] , which are God-The Father’s."
1 Corinthians,7,1,Now concerning the things whereof you 2f wrote unto me: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman.
1 Corinthians,7,2,"Nevertheless, [to avoid] fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband."
1 Corinthians,7,3,Let the husband render unto the wife sexual dues: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
1 Corinthians,7,4,"The wife has not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband has not power of his own body, but the wife."
1 Corinthians,7,5,"Defraud you 2f not one the other, except [it be] with consent for a time, that you 2f may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan [the adversary] tempt you not for your incontinency."
1 Corinthians,7,6,"But I speak this by permission, [and] not of commandment."
1 Corinthians,7,7,"For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man has his proper (one’s own; peculiar; particular) gift of God-The Father, one after this manner, and another after that."
1 Corinthians,7,8,"I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I."
1 Corinthians,7,9,"But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn."
1 Corinthians,7,10,"And unto the married I command, [yet] not I, but the Lord - Kurios, Let not the wife depart from [her] husband:"
1 Corinthians,7,11,"But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to [her] husband: and let not the husband put away [his] wife."
1 Corinthians,7,12,"But to the rest speak I, not the Lord - Kurios: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away."
1 Corinthians,7,13,"And the woman which has an husband that believes not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him."
1 Corinthians,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy."
1 Corinthians,7,15,"But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such [cases] : but God-The Father has called us to peace."
1 Corinthians,7,16,"For what know you i , O wife, whether you i shall save [your i ] husband? or how know you i , O man, whether you i shall save [your i ] wife?"
1 Corinthians,7,17,"But as God-The Father has distributed to every man, as the Lord - Kurios has called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches."
1 Corinthians,7,18,Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
1 Corinthians,7,19,"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but [the important thing is] the keeping of the commandments of God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,7,20,Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
1 Corinthians,7,21,"Are you i called [being] a slave? care not for it: but if you i may be made free, use [it] rather."
1 Corinthians,7,22,"For he that is called in the Lord - Kurios, [being] a slave, is the Lord - Kurios’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, [being] free, is Moshiach [Messiah] ’s slave."
1 Corinthians,7,23,You 2f are bought with a price; be not you 2f the servants of men.
1 Corinthians,7,24,"Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, in it abide with God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,7,25,"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord - Kurios: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord - Kurios to be faithful."
1 Corinthians,7,26,"I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, [I say] , that [it is] good for a man so to be."
1 Corinthians,7,27,Are you i bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Are you i loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
1 Corinthians,7,28,"But and if you i marry, you i have not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you."
1 Corinthians,7,29,"But this I say, brethren, the time [is] short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;"
1 Corinthians,7,30,"And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;"
1 Corinthians,7,31,"And they that use this world, as not abusing [it] : for the fashion of this world passes away."
1 Corinthians,7,32,"But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord - Kurios, how he may please the Lord - Kurios:"
1 Corinthians,7,33,"But he that is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please [his] wife."
1 Corinthians,7,34,"There is difference [also] between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord - Kurios, that she may be holy both in body and in Spirit [Ruach] : but she that is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please [her] husband."
1 Corinthians,7,35,"And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely (attractive; proper (one’s own; peculiar; particular); becoming) , and that you 2f may attend upon the Lord - Kurios without distraction."
1 Corinthians,7,36,"But if any man think that he behaves himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of [her] age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sins not: let them marry."
1 Corinthians,7,37,"Nevertheless he that stands stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well."
1 Corinthians,7,38,So then he that gives [her] in marriage does well; but he that gives [her] not in marriage does better.
1 Corinthians,7,39,"The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord - Kurios."
1 Corinthians,7,40,"But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit [Ruach] of God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,8,1,"Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth."
1 Corinthians,8,2,"And if any man think that he knows any thing, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know."
1 Corinthians,8,3,"But if any man love God-The Father, the same is known of him."
1 Corinthians,8,4,"As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol [is] nothing in the world, and that [there is] none other God-The Father but one."
1 Corinthians,8,5,"For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)"
1 Corinthians,8,6,"But to us [there is but] one God-The Father, the Father, of whom [are] all things, and we in him; and one Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , by whom [are] all things, and we by him."
1 Corinthians,8,7,However [there is] not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat [it] as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
1 Corinthians,8,8,"But meat commends us not to God-The Father: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse."
1 Corinthians,8,9,But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.
1 Corinthians,8,10,"For if any man see you i which have knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;"
1 Corinthians,8,11,"And through your i knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Moshiach [Messiah] died?"
1 Corinthians,8,12,"But when you 2f sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you 2f sin against Moshiach [Messiah]."
1 Corinthians,8,13,"For what reason, if meat make my brother to offend (make angry; make one stumble; violate) , I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to offend (make angry; make one stumble; violate)."
1 Corinthians,9,1,Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] our Lord - Kurios? are not you 2f my work in the Lord - Kurios?
1 Corinthians,9,2,"If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of my apostleship are you 2f in the Lord - Kurios."
1 Corinthians,9,3,"Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,"
1 Corinthians,9,4,Have we not power to eat and to drink?
1 Corinthians,9,5,"Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and [as] the brethren of the Lord - Kurios, and Kefa [pebble]?"
1 Corinthians,9,6,"Or I only and Bar-Nabba [son of rest] , have not we power to refrain (restrain; refrein from acting) working?"
1 Corinthians,9,7,"Who goes a warfare any time at his own charges? who plants a vineyard, and eats not of the fruit thereof? or who feeds a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?"
1 Corinthians,9,8,Say I these things as a man? or says not the law the same also?
1 Corinthians,9,9,"For it is written in the law of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , you i shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads out the corn. Does God-The Father take care for oxen?"
1 Corinthians,9,10,"Or says he [it] altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, [this] is written: that he that plows should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope."
1 Corinthians,9,11,"If we have sown unto you spiritual things, [is it] a great thing if we shall reap your carnal (of the flesh, sensual) things?"
1 Corinthians,9,12,"If others be partakers of [this] power over you, [are] not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer (allow, to let, permit) all things, lest we should hinder the Gospel (joyful message) of Moshiach [Messiah]."
1 Corinthians,9,13,Do you 2f not know that they which minister about holy things live [of the things] of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?
1 Corinthians,9,14,Even so has the Lord - Kurios ordained that they which preach the Gospel (joyful message) should live of the Gospel (joyful message).
1 Corinthians,9,15,"But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for [it were] better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void."
1 Corinthians,9,16,"For though I preach the Gospel (joyful message) , I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yes, woe is unto me, if I preach not the Gospel (joyful message)!"
1 Corinthians,9,17,"For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation [of the Gospel (joyful message)] is committed unto me."
1 Corinthians,9,18,"What is my reward then? [Truly] that, when I preach the Gospel (joyful message) , I may make the Gospel (joyful message) of Moshiach [Messiah] without charge, that I abuse not my power in the Gospel (joyful message)."
1 Corinthians,9,19,"For though I be free from all [men] , yet have I made myself slave unto all, that I might gain the more."
1 Corinthians,9,20,"And unto the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] I became as a Jewish person, that I might gain the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] ; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;"
1 Corinthians,9,21,"To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God-The Father, but under the law to Moshiach [Messiah] ,) that I might gain them that are without law."
1 Corinthians,9,22,"To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all [men] , that I might by all means save some."
1 Corinthians,9,23,"And this I do for the Gospel (joyful message) ’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with [you]."
1 Corinthians,9,24,"Know you 2f not that they which run in a race run all, but one receives the prize? So run, that you 2f may obtain."
1 Corinthians,9,25,And every man that strives for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they [do it] to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
1 Corinthians,9,26,"I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beats the air:"
1 Corinthians,9,27,"But I keep under my body, and bring [it] into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway."
1 Corinthians,10,1,"Moreover, brethren, I would not that you 2f should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;"
1 Corinthians,10,2,And were all baptized unto Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] in the cloud and in the sea;
1 Corinthians,10,3,And did all eat the same spiritual meat;
1 Corinthians,10,4,And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Moshiach [Messiah].
1 Corinthians,10,5,But with many of them God-The Father was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
1 Corinthians,10,6,"Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted."
1 Corinthians,10,7,"Neither be you 2f idolaters, as [were] some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play."
1 Corinthians,10,8,"Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand."
1 Corinthians,10,9,"Neither let us tempt Moshiach [Messiah] , as some of them also tried or tested, and were destroyed of serpents."
1 Corinthians,10,10,"Neither murmur you 2f , as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer."
1 Corinthians,10,11,"Now all these things happened unto them for examples (types) : and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come."
1 Corinthians,10,12,For what reason let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.
1 Corinthians,10,13,"There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God-The Father [is] faithful, who will not suffer (allow, to let, permit) you to be tried or tested above that you 2f are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you 2f may be able to bear [it]."
1 Corinthians,10,14,"For what reason, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry."
1 Corinthians,10,15,I speak as to wise men; judge you 2f what I say.
1 Corinthians,10,16,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Moshiach [Messiah] ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Moshiach [Messiah]?"
1 Corinthians,10,17,"For we [being] many are one bread, [and] one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread."
1 Corinthians,10,18,Behold Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
1 Corinthians,10,19,"What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?"
1 Corinthians,10,20,"But I [say] , that the things which the Goyim [Gentiles] sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God-The Father: and I would not that you 2f should have fellowship with demons."
1 Corinthians,10,21,"You 2f cannot drink the cup of the Lord - Kurios, and the cup of demons: you 2f cannot be partakers of the Lord - Kurios’s table, and of the table of demons."
1 Corinthians,10,22,Do we provoke the Lord - Kurios to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
1 Corinthians,10,23,"All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not."
1 Corinthians,10,24,"Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s [wealth]."
1 Corinthians,10,25,"Whatsoever is sold in the marketplace, [that] eat, asking no question for conscience sake:"
1 Corinthians,10,26,"For the earth [is] the Lord - Kurios’s, and the fullness thereof."
1 Corinthians,10,27,"If any of them that believe not bid you [to a feast] , and you 2f be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake."
1 Corinthians,10,28,"But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth [is] the Lord - Kurios’s, and the fullness thereof:"
1 Corinthians,10,29,"Conscience, I say, not your i own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another [man’s] conscience?"
1 Corinthians,10,30,"For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?"
1 Corinthians,10,31,"Whether therefore you 2f eat, or drink, or whatsoever you 2f do, do all to the glory of God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,10,32,"Give none offence, neither to the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , nor to the Goyim [Gentiles] , nor to the church of God-The Father:"
1 Corinthians,10,33,"Even as I please all [men] in all [things] , not seeking my own profit, but the [profit] of many, that they may be saved."
1 Corinthians,11,1,"Be you 2f followers of me, even as I also [am] of Moshiach [Messiah]."
1 Corinthians,11,2,"Now I praise you, brethren, that you 2f remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered [them] to you."
1 Corinthians,11,3,"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Moshiach [Messiah] ; and the head of the woman [is] the man; and the head of Moshiach [Messiah] [is] God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,11,4,"Every man praying or prophesying, having [his] head covered, dishonours his head."
1 Corinthians,11,5,But every woman that prays or prophesies with [her] head uncovered dishonours her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
1 Corinthians,11,6,"For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered."
1 Corinthians,11,7,"For a man indeed ought not to cover [his] head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God-The Father: but the woman is the glory of the man."
1 Corinthians,11,8,For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
1 Corinthians,11,9,Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
1 Corinthians,11,10,For this cause ought the woman to have power on [her] head because of the angels.
1 Corinthians,11,11,"Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord - Kurios."
1 Corinthians,11,12,"For as the woman [is] of the man, even so [is] the man also by the woman; but all things of God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,11,13,Judge in yourselves: is it comely (attractive; proper (one’s own; peculiar; particular); becoming) that a woman pray unto God-The Father uncovered?
1 Corinthians,11,14,"Does not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?"
1 Corinthians,11,15,"But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for [her] hair is given her for a covering."
1 Corinthians,11,16,"But if any man seem to be contentious (loving to quarrel and angrily debate) , we have no such custom, neither the churches of God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,11,17,"Now in this that I declare [unto you] I praise [you] not, that you 2f come together not for the better, but for the worse."
1 Corinthians,11,18,"For first of all, when you 2f come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it."
1 Corinthians,11,19,"For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you."
1 Corinthians,11,20,"When you 2f come together therefore into one place, [this] is not to eat the Lord - Kurios’s supper."
1 Corinthians,11,21,"For in eating every one takes before [other] his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken."
1 Corinthians,11,22,"What? have you 2f not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise you 2f the church of God-The Father, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise [you] not."
1 Corinthians,11,23,"For I have received of the Lord - Kurios that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] the [same] night in which he was betrayed took bread:"
1 Corinthians,11,24,"And when he had given thanks, he broke [it] , and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me."
1 Corinthians,11,25,"After the same manner also [he took] the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament (a covenant, ratified in death) in my blood: this do you 2f , as oft as you 2f drink [it] , in remembrance of me."
1 Corinthians,11,26,"For as often as you 2f eat this bread, and drink this cup, you 2f do show the Lord - Kurios’s death till he come."
1 Corinthians,11,27,"For what reason whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink [this] cup of the Lord - Kurios, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord - Kurios."
1 Corinthians,11,28,"But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread, and drink of [that] cup."
1 Corinthians,11,29,"For he that eats and drink unworthily, eats and drink damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord - Kurios’s body."
1 Corinthians,11,30,"For this cause many [are] weak and sickly among you, and many sleep."
1 Corinthians,11,31,"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged."
1 Corinthians,11,32,"But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord - Kurios, that we should not be condemned with the world."
1 Corinthians,11,33,"For what reason, my brethren, when you 2f come together to eat, wait one for another."
1 Corinthians,11,34,"And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that you 2f come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come."
1 Corinthians,12,1,"Now concerning spiritual [gifts] , brethren, I would not have you ignorant."
1 Corinthians,12,2,"You 2f know that you 2f were Goyim [Gentiles] , carried away unto these dumb idols, even as you 2f were led."
1 Corinthians,12,3,"For what reason I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit [Ruach] of God-The Father calls Yeshua [God is Salvation] accursed: and [that] no man can say that Yeshua [God is Salvation] is the Lord - Kurios, but by the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh]."
1 Corinthians,12,4,"Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit [Ruach]."
1 Corinthians,12,5,"And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord - Kurios."
1 Corinthians,12,6,"And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God-The Father which works all in all."
1 Corinthians,12,7,But the manifestation of the Spirit [Ruach] is given to every man to profit withal.
1 Corinthians,12,8,For to one is given by the Spirit [Ruach] the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit [Ruach];
1 Corinthians,12,9,To another faith by the same Spirit [Ruach] ; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit [Ruach];
1 Corinthians,12,10,To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another [different] kinds of tongues (foreign languages) ; to another the interpretation of tongues (foreign languages):
1 Corinthians,12,11,"But all these works that one and the selfsame Spirit [Ruach] , expounding (dissecting) to every man severally as he will."
1 Corinthians,12,12,"For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also [is] Moshiach [Messiah]."
1 Corinthians,12,13,"For by one Spirit [Ruach] are we all baptized into one body, whether [we be] Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] or Goyim [Gentiles] , whether [we be] bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit [Ruach]."
1 Corinthians,12,14,"For the body is not one member, but many."
1 Corinthians,12,15,"If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
1 Corinthians,12,16,"And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
1 Corinthians,12,17,"If the whole body [were] an eye, where [were] the hearing? If the whole [were] hearing, where [were] the smelling?"
1 Corinthians,12,18,"But now has God-The Father set the members every one of them in the body, as it has pleased him."
1 Corinthians,12,19,"And if they were all one member, where [were] the body?"
1 Corinthians,12,20,"But now [are they] many members, yet but one body."
1 Corinthians,12,21,"And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of you i : nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you."
1 Corinthians,12,22,"No, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:"
1 Corinthians,12,23,"And those [members] of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness."
1 Corinthians,12,24,"For our comely (attractive; proper (one’s own; peculiar; particular); becoming) [parts] have no need: but God-The Father has tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that [part] which lacked:"
1 Corinthians,12,25,That there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should have the same care one for another.
1 Corinthians,12,26,"And whether one member suffer (allow, to let, permit) , all the members suffer (allow, to let, permit) with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it."
1 Corinthians,12,27,"Now you 2f are the body of Moshiach [Messiah] , and members in particular."
1 Corinthians,12,28,"And God-The Father has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues (foreign languages)."
1 Corinthians,12,29, [Are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [are] all workers of miracles?
1 Corinthians,12,30,Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues (foreign languages) ? do all interpret?
1 Corinthians,12,31,But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I unto you a more excellent way.
1 Corinthians,13,1,"Though I speak with the tongues (foreign languages) of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become [as] sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."
1 Corinthians,13,2,"And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,3,"And though I bestow all my goods to feed [the poor] , and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profits me nothing."
1 Corinthians,13,4,"Charity suffers long, [and] is kind; charity envies not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,"
1 Corinthians,13,5,"Does not behave itself inappropriate, seeks not her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil;"
1 Corinthians,13,6,"Rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;"
1 Corinthians,13,7,"Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."
1 Corinthians,13,8,"Charity never fails: but whether [there be] prophecies, they shall fail; whether [there be] tongues (foreign languages) , they shall cease; whether [there be] knowledge, it shall vanish away."
1 Corinthians,13,9,"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part."
1 Corinthians,13,10,"But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away."
1 Corinthians,13,11,"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things."
1 Corinthians,13,12,"For now we see through a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known."
1 Corinthians,13,13,"And now abides faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these [is] charity."
1 Corinthians,14,1,"Follow after charity, and desire spiritual [gifts] , but rather that you 2f may prophesy."
1 Corinthians,14,2,"For he that speaks in an [unknown] tongue speaks not unto men, but unto God-The Father: for no man understands [him] ; howbeit in the Spirit [Ruach] he speaks mysteries."
1 Corinthians,14,3,"But he that prophesies speaks unto men [to] edification, and Exhortation (encouragement; counsel) , and comfort."
1 Corinthians,14,4,He that speaks in an [unknown] tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies the church.
1 Corinthians,14,5,"I would that you 2f all spoke with tongues (foreign languages) , but rather that you 2f prophesied: for greater [is] he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues (foreign languages) , except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying."
1 Corinthians,14,6,"Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues (foreign languages) , what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?"
1 Corinthians,14,7,"And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?"
1 Corinthians,14,8,"For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?"
1 Corinthians,14,9,"So likewise you 2f , except you 2f utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for you 2f shall speak into the air."
1 Corinthians,14,10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them [is] without signification."
1 Corinthians,14,11,"Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks [shall be] a barbarian unto me."
1 Corinthians,14,12,"Even so you 2f , forasmuch as you 2f are zealous of spiritual [gifts] , seek that you 2f may excel to the edifying of the church."
1 Corinthians,14,13,For what reason let him that speaks in an [unknown] tongue pray that he may interpret.
1 Corinthians,14,14,"For if I pray in an [unknown] tongue, my Spirit [Ruach] prays, but my understanding is unfruitful."
1 Corinthians,14,15,"What is it then? I will pray with the Spirit [Ruach] , and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the Spirit [Ruach] , and I will sing with the understanding also."
1 Corinthians,14,16,"Else when you i shall bless with the Spirit [Ruach] , how shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say Amen at your i giving of thanks, seeing he understands not what you i say?"
1 Corinthians,14,17,"For you i truly give thanks well, but the other is not edified."
1 Corinthians,14,18,"I thank my God-The Father, I speak with tongues (foreign languages) more than you 2f all:"
1 Corinthians,14,19,"Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that [by my voice] I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an [unknown] tongue."
1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be you 2f children, but in understanding be men."
1 Corinthians,14,21,"In the law it is written, With [men of] other tongues (foreign languages) and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, says the Lord - Kurios."
1 Corinthians,14,22,"For what reason tongues (foreign languages) are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying [serves] not for them that believe not, but for them which believe."
1 Corinthians,14,23,"If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues (foreign languages) , and there come in [those that are] unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you 2f are mad?"
1 Corinthians,14,24,"But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or [one] unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:"
1 Corinthians,14,25,"And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on [his] face he will worship God-The Father, and report that God-The Father is in you of a truth."
1 Corinthians,14,26,"How is it then, brethren? when you 2f come together, every one of you has a Psalm (sacred song about or to God) , has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying."
1 Corinthians,14,27,"If any man speak in an [unknown] tongue, [let it be] by two, or at the most [by] three, and [that] by course; and let one interpret."
1 Corinthians,14,28,"But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,14,29,"Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge."
1 Corinthians,14,30,"If [any thing] be revealed to another that sits by, let the first hold his peace."
1 Corinthians,14,31,"For you 2f may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted."
1 Corinthians,14,32,And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
1 Corinthians,14,33,"For God-The Father is not [the author] of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints."
1 Corinthians,14,34,"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but [they are commanded] to be under obedience, as also says the law."
1 Corinthians,14,35,"And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church."
1 Corinthians,14,36,What? came the word of God-The Father out from you? or came it unto you only?
1 Corinthians,14,37,"If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord - Kurios."
1 Corinthians,14,38,"But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant."
1 Corinthians,14,39,"For what reason, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues (foreign languages)."
1 Corinthians,14,40,Let all things be done decently and in order.
1 Corinthians,15,1,"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the Gospel (joyful message) which I preached unto you, which also you 2f have received, and wherein you 2f stand;"
1 Corinthians,15,2,"By which also you 2f are saved, if you 2f keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless you 2f have believed in vain."
1 Corinthians,15,3,"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Moshiach [Messiah] died for our sins according to the scriptures;"
1 Corinthians,15,4,"And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:"
1 Corinthians,15,5,"And that he was seen of Kefa [pebble] , then of the twelve:"
1 Corinthians,15,6,"After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep."
1 Corinthians,15,7,"After that, he was seen of Ya’akov [heal-grabber] ; then of all the apostles."
1 Corinthians,15,8,"And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time."
1 Corinthians,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God-The Father."
1 Corinthians,15,10,"But by the grace of God-The Father I am what I am: and his grace which [was bestowed] upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God-The Father which was with me."
1 Corinthians,15,11,"Therefore whether [it were] I or they, so we preach, and so you 2f believed."
1 Corinthians,15,12,"Now if Moshiach [Messiah] be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
1 Corinthians,15,13,"But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Moshiach [Messiah] not risen:"
1 Corinthians,15,14,"And if Moshiach [Messiah] be not risen, then [is] our preaching vain, and your faith [is] also vain."
1 Corinthians,15,15,"Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God-The Father; because we have testified of God-The Father that he raised up Moshiach [Messiah] : whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not."
1 Corinthians,15,16,"For if the dead rise not, then is not Moshiach [Messiah] raised:"
1 Corinthians,15,17,"And if Moshiach [Messiah] be not raised, your faith [is] vain; you 2f are yet in your sins."
1 Corinthians,15,18,Then they also which are fallen asleep in Moshiach [Messiah] are perished.
1 Corinthians,15,19,"If in this life only we have hope in Moshiach [Messiah] , we are of all men most miserable."
1 Corinthians,15,20,"But now is Moshiach [Messiah] risen from the dead, [and] become the firstfruits of them that slept."
1 Corinthians,15,21,"For since by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead."
1 Corinthians,15,22,"For as in Adam (Man, ground; red; earthling) all die, even so in Moshiach [Messiah] shall all be made alive."
1 Corinthians,15,23,But every man in his own order: Moshiach [Messiah] the firstfruits; afterward they that are Moshiach [Messiah] ’s at his coming.
1 Corinthians,15,24,"Then [comes] the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God-The Father, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power."
1 Corinthians,15,25,"For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet."
1 Corinthians,15,26,The last enemy [that] shall be destroyed [is] death.
1 Corinthians,15,27,"For he has put all things under his feet. But when he says all things are put under [him, it is] manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him."
1 Corinthians,15,28,"And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God-The Father may be all in all."
1 Corinthians,15,29,"Else what shall they do which are baptized for the hope of the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?"
1 Corinthians,15,30,And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
1 Corinthians,15,31,"I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] our Lord - Kurios, I die daily."
1 Corinthians,15,32,"If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus [permitted] , what advantage it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die."
1 Corinthians,15,33,"Be not deceived: evil associations, companionships corrupt good manners."
1 Corinthians,15,34,"Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God-The Father: I speak [this] to your shame."
1 Corinthians,15,35,"But some [man] will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?"
1 Corinthians,15,36," [you i ] fool, that which you i sow is not quickened, except it die:"
1 Corinthians,15,37,"And that which you i sows, you i sows not that body that shall be, but bore grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other [grain]:"
1 Corinthians,15,38,"But God-The Father gives it a body as it has pleased him, and to every seed his own body."
1 Corinthians,15,39,"All flesh [is] not the same flesh: but [there is] one [kind of] flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, [and] another of birds."
1 Corinthians,15,40," [There are] also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial [is] one, and the [glory] of the terrestrial [is] another."
1 Corinthians,15,41," [There is] one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for [one] star differs from [another] star in glory."
1 Corinthians,15,42,So also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
1 Corinthians,15,43,It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
1 Corinthians,15,44,"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body."
1 Corinthians,15,45,"And so it is written, The first man Adam (Man, ground; red; earthling) was made a living soul; the last Adam (Man, ground; red; earthling) [was made] a quickening Spirit [Ruach]."
1 Corinthians,15,46,"However that [was] not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual."
1 Corinthians,15,47,"The first man [is] of the earth, earthy: the second man [is] the Lord - Kurios from heaven."
1 Corinthians,15,48,"As [is] the earthy, such [are] they also that are earthy: and as [is] the heavenly, such [are] they also that are heavenly."
1 Corinthians,15,49,"And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly."
1 Corinthians,15,50,"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God-The Father; neither does corruption inherit incorruption."
1 Corinthians,15,51,"Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,"
1 Corinthians,15,52,"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."
1 Corinthians,15,53,"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality."
1 Corinthians,15,54,"So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."
1 Corinthians,15,55,"O death, where [is] your i sting? O grave, where [is] your i victory?"
1 Corinthians,15,56,The sting of death [is] sin; and the strength of sin [is] the law.
1 Corinthians,15,57,"But thanks [be] to God-The Father, which gives us the victory through our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
1 Corinthians,15,58,"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be you 2f stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord - Kurios, forasmuch as you 2f know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord - Kurios."
1 Corinthians,16,1,"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia [land of the Galli, Gauls, A Celt] , even so do you 2f."
1 Corinthians,16,2,"Upon the first [day] of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as [God-The Father] has prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come."
1 Corinthians,16,3,"And when I come, whomsoever you 2f shall approve by [your] letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
1 Corinthians,16,4,"And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me."
1 Corinthians,16,5,"Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia [extended land] : for I do pass through Macedonia [extended land]."
1 Corinthians,16,6,"And it may be that I will abide, yes, and winter with you, that you 2f may bring me on my journey to wherever I go."
1 Corinthians,16,7,"For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to wait a while with you, if the Lord - Kurios permit."
1 Corinthians,16,8,But I will wait at Ephesus [permitted] until Pentecost.
1 Corinthians,16,9,"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and [there are] many adversaries."
1 Corinthians,16,10,"Now if Timothy [honoring God] come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord - Kurios, as I also [do]."
1 Corinthians,16,11,"Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren."
1 Corinthians,16,12,"As touching [our] brother Apollos [given by Apollo (etymology uncertain)] , I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient (fit; appropriate; proper (one’s own; peculiar; particular)) time."
1 Corinthians,16,13,"Watch you 2f , stand fast in the faith, keep on you like men (behave/act as a man should) , be strong."
1 Corinthians,16,14,Let all your things be done with charity.
1 Corinthians,16,15,"I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you, brethren, (you 2f know the house of Stephanas [crowned] , that it is the firstfruits of Achaia [trouble] , and [that] they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)"
1 Corinthians,16,16,"That you 2f submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helps with [us] , and labours."
1 Corinthians,16,17,I am glad of the coming of Stephanas [crowned] and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
1 Corinthians,16,18,For they have refreshed my Spirit [Ruach] and yours: therefore acknowledge you 2f them that are such.
1 Corinthians,16,19,"The churches of Asia [orient] salute you. Aquila [an eagle] and Priscilla [ancient] salute you much in the Lord - Kurios, with the church that is in their house."
1 Corinthians,16,20,All the brethren greet you. Greet you 2f one another with an holy kiss.
1 Corinthians,16,21,The Greeting of [me] Sha’ul [desired] with my own hand.
1 Corinthians,16,22,"If any man love not the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , let him be a thing set up or laid by in order to be kept Maranatha [our Lord - Kurios comes]."
1 Corinthians,16,23,The grace of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] [be] with you.
1 Corinthians,16,24,My love [be] with you all in Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation] . Amen. <[The first [Epistle (important or formal letter)] to the Corinthians [satiated] was written from Philippi [lover of horses] by Stephanas [crowned] and Fortunatus and Achaicus and Timothy [honoring God] .]>
