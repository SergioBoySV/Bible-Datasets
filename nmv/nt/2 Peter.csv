2 Peter,1,1,"Shim’on [he has heard] Kefa [pebble] [pebble] , a slave and an apostle of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God-The Father and our Saviour Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]:"
2 Peter,1,2,"Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God-The Father, and of Yeshua [God is Salvation] our Lord - Kurios,"
2 Peter,1,3,"According as his divine power has given unto us all things that [pertain] unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue (power):"
2 Peter,1,4,"Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these you 2f might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
2 Peter,1,5,"And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue (power) ; and to virtue (power) knowledge;"
2 Peter,1,6,And to knowledge self-control; and to self-control patience; and to patience godliness;
2 Peter,1,7,And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
2 Peter,1,8,"For if these things be in you, and abound, they make [you that you 2f shall] neither [be] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
2 Peter,1,9,"But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins."
2 Peter,1,10,"For what reason the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you 2f do these things, you 2f shall never fall:"
2 Peter,1,11,For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord - Kurios and Saviour Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah].
2 Peter,1,12,"For what reason I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you 2f know [them] , and be established in the present truth."
2 Peter,1,13,"Yes, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting [you] in remembrance;"
2 Peter,1,14,"Knowing that shortly I must put off [this] my tabernacle, even as our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] has showed me."
2 Peter,1,15,Moreover I will endeavour that you 2f may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.
2 Peter,1,16,"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , but were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
2 Peter,1,17,"For he received from God-The Father the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
2 Peter,1,18,"And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount."
2 Peter,1,19,"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you 2f do well that you 2f take heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:"
2 Peter,1,20,"Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation."
2 Peter,1,21,For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God-The Father spoke [as they were] moved by the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh].
2 Peter,2,1,"But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord - Kurios that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction."
2 Peter,2,2,"And many shall follow their pernicious (destructive, something that can injure) ways; by reason of whom the way of tshall be evil spoken of."
2 Peter,2,3,"And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation slumbers not."
2 Peter,2,4,"For if God-The Father spared not the angels that sinned, but cast [them] down to hell, and delivered [them] into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;"
2 Peter,2,5,"And spared not the old world, but saved No’ach [rest] the eighth [person] , preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;"
2 Peter,2,6,"And turning the cities of S’dom [Burning] and ‘Amorah [a ruined heap] into ashes condemned [them] with an overthrow, making [them] an example unto those that after should live ungodly;"
2 Peter,2,7,"And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy Conversation (behavior; way of life; community) of the wicked:"
2 Peter,2,8,"(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed [his] righteous soul from day to day with [their] unlawful deeds;)"
2 Peter,2,9,"The Lord - Kurios knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:"
2 Peter,2,10,"But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous [are they] , selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities."
2 Peter,2,11,"Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord - Kurios."
2 Peter,2,12,"But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;"
2 Peter,2,13,"And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, [as] they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots [they are] and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;"
2 Peter,2,14,"Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:"
2 Peter,2,15,"Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Bil’am [Not of the People] [the son] of B’sor [burning or torch] , who loved the wages of unrighteousness;"
2 Peter,2,16,But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man’s voice forbad the madness of the prophet.
2 Peter,2,17,"These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved forever."
2 Peter,2,18,"For when they speak great swelling [words] of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, [through much] wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error."
2 Peter,2,19,"While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage."
2 Peter,2,20,"For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord - Kurios and Saviour Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , they are again entangled in it, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning."
2 Peter,2,21,"For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known [it] , to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them."
2 Peter,2,22,"But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog [is] turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."
2 Peter,3,1,"This second Epistle (important or formal letter) , beloved, I now write unto you; in [both] which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:"
2 Peter,3,2,"That you 2f may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord - Kurios and Saviour:"
2 Peter,3,3,"Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,"
2 Peter,3,4,"And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as [they were] from the beginning of the creation."
2 Peter,3,5,"For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God-The Father the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:"
2 Peter,3,6,"Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:"
2 Peter,3,7,"But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men."
2 Peter,3,8,"But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day [is] with the Lord - Kurios as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."
2 Peter,3,9,"The Lord - Kurios is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward (in custody, with a guard; prison) , not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."
2 Peter,3,10,"But the day of the Lord - Kurios will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are in it shall be burned up."
2 Peter,3,11," [Seeing] then [that] all these things shall be dissolved, what manner [of persons] ought you 2f to be in [all] holy Conversation (behavior; way of life; community) and godliness,"
2 Peter,3,12,"Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God-The Father, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?"
2 Peter,3,13,"Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness."
2 Peter,3,14,"For what reason, beloved, seeing that you 2f look for such things, be diligent that you 2f may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless."
2 Peter,3,15,And account [that] the longsuffering of our Lord - Kurios [is] salvation; even as our beloved brother Sha’ul [desired] also according to the wisdom given unto him has written unto you;
2 Peter,3,16,"As also in all [his] epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as [they do] also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction."
2 Peter,3,17,"You 2f therefore, beloved, seeing you 2f know [these things] before, beware lest you 2f also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness."
2 Peter,3,18,"But grow in grace, and [in] the knowledge of our Lord - Kurios and Saviour Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] . To him [be] glory both now and forever. Amen."
