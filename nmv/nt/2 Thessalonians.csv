2 Thessalonians,1,1,"Sha’ul [desired] , and Silvanus (Silas) [woody] , and Timothy [honoring God] , unto the church of the Thessalonians [victory of falsity] in God-The Father our Father and the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]:"
2 Thessalonians,1,2,"Grace unto you, and peace, from God-The Father our Father and the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
2 Thessalonians,1,3,"We are bound to thank God-The Father always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other abounds;"
2 Thessalonians,1,4,So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God-The Father for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you 2f endure:
2 Thessalonians,1,5," [Which is] a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God-The Father, that you 2f may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God-The Father, for which you 2f also suffer (allow, to let, permit):"
2 Thessalonians,1,6,Seeing [it is] a righteous thing with God-The Father to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
2 Thessalonians,1,7,"And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,"
2 Thessalonians,1,8,"In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God-The Father, and that obey not the Gospel (joyful message) of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]:"
2 Thessalonians,1,9,"Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord - Kurios, and from the glory of his power;"
2 Thessalonians,1,10,"When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day."
2 Thessalonians,1,11,"For what reason also we pray always for you, that our God-The Father would count you worthy of [this] calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of [his] goodness, and the work of faith with power:"
2 Thessalonians,1,12,"That the name of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] may be glorified in you, and you 2f in him, according to the grace of our God-The Father and the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
2 Thessalonians,2,1,"Now we beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , and [by] our gathering together unto him,"
2 Thessalonians,2,2,"That you 2f be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by Spirit [Ruach] , nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Moshiach [Messiah] is at hand."
2 Thessalonians,2,3,"Let no man deceive you by any means: for [that day shall not come] , except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;"
2 Thessalonians,2,4,"Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God-The Father, or that is worshipped; so that he as God-The Father sits in the temple of God-The Father, showing himself that he is God-The Father."
2 Thessalonians,2,5,"Remember you 2f not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?"
2 Thessalonians,2,6,And now you 2f know what withholds that he might be revealed in his time.
2 Thessalonians,2,7,"For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets [will let] , until he be taken out of the way."
2 Thessalonians,2,8,"And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord - Kurios shall consume with the Spirit [Ruach] of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:"
2 Thessalonians,2,9," [Even him] , whose coming is after the working of Satan [the adversary] with all power and signs and lying wonders,"
2 Thessalonians,2,10,"And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved."
2 Thessalonians,2,11,"And for this cause God-The Father shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:"
2 Thessalonians,2,12,"That they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
2 Thessalonians,2,13,"But we are bound to give thanks always to God-The Father for you, brethren beloved of the Lord - Kurios, because God-The Father has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit [Ruach] and belief of the truth:"
2 Thessalonians,2,14,"Whereunto he called you by our Gospel (joyful message) , to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
2 Thessalonians,2,15,"Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you 2f have been taught, whether by word, or our Epistle (important or formal letter)."
2 Thessalonians,2,16,"Now our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] himself, and God-The Father, even our Father, which has loved us, and has given [us] everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,"
2 Thessalonians,2,17,"Comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work."
2 Thessalonians,3,1,"Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord - Kurios may have [free] course, and be glorified, even as [it is] with you:"
2 Thessalonians,3,2,And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all [men] have not faith.
2 Thessalonians,3,3,"But the Lord - Kurios is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep [you] from evil."
2 Thessalonians,3,4,"And we have confidence in the Lord - Kurios touching you, that you 2f both do and will do the things which we command you."
2 Thessalonians,3,5,"And the Lord - Kurios direct your hearts into the love of God-The Father, and into the patient waiting for Moshiach [Messiah]."
2 Thessalonians,3,6,"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , that you 2f withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us."
2 Thessalonians,3,7,For yourselves know how you 2f ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
2 Thessalonians,3,8,"Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nothing; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:"
2 Thessalonians,3,9,"Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us."
2 Thessalonians,3,10,"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat."
2 Thessalonians,3,11,"For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies."
2 Thessalonians,3,12,"Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread."
2 Thessalonians,3,13,"But you 2f , brethren, be not weary in well doing."
2 Thessalonians,3,14,"And if any man obey not our word by this Epistle (important or formal letter) , note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed."
2 Thessalonians,3,15,"Yet count [him] not as an enemy, but admonish [him] as a brother."
2 Thessalonians,3,16,Now the Lord - Kurios of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord - Kurios [be] with you all.
2 Thessalonians,3,17,"The Greeting of Sha’ul [desired] with my own hand, which is the token in every Epistle (important or formal letter) : so I write."
2 Thessalonians,3,18,The grace of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] [be] with you all. Amen. <The second Epistle (important or formal letter) to the Thessalonians [victory of falsity] was written from Athens [uncertainty] .>
