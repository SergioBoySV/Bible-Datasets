Mark,1,1,"The beginning of the Gospel (joyful message) of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , the Son of God-Theos;"
Mark,1,2,"As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before your i face, which shall prepare your i way before you i."
Mark,1,3,"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you 2f the way of the Lord - Kurios, make his paths straight."
Mark,1,4,"Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the forgiveness (pardon) of sins."
Mark,1,5,"And there went out unto him all the land of Y’hudah [praised] , and they of Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and were all baptized of him in the river of Yarden [descender] , confessing their sins."
Mark,1,6,"And Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a belt of a skin about his waist; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;"
Mark,1,7,"And preached, saying, There comes one mightier than I after me, the sandal lace of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose."
Mark,1,8,I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh].
Mark,1,9,"And it came to pass in those days, that Yeshua [God is Salvation] came from Natzeret [one separated] of Galil [circuit, district] , and was baptized of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] in Yarden [descender]."
Mark,1,10,"And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit [Ruach] like a dove descending upon him:"
Mark,1,11,"And there came a voice from heaven, [saying] , you i are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
Mark,1,12,And immediately the Spirit [Ruach] drives him into the wilderness.
Mark,1,13,"And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tried or tested of Satan [the adversary] ; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him."
Mark,1,14,"Now after that Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] was put in prison, Yeshua [God is Salvation] came into Galil [circuit, district] , preaching the Gospel (joyful message) of the kingdom of God-Theos,"
Mark,1,15,"And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God-Theos is at hand: repent you 2f , and believe the Gospel (joyful message)."
Mark,1,16,"Now as he walked by the sea of Galil [circuit, district] , he saw Shim’on [he has heard] and Andrew [of a man] his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers."
Mark,1,17,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto them, Come you 2f after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men."
Mark,1,18,"And immediately they forsook their nets, and followed him."
Mark,1,19,"And when he had gone a little further there, he saw Ya’akov [heal-grabber] the [son] of Zavdai [Yah has bestowed] , and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets."
Mark,1,20,"And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zavdai [Yah has bestowed] in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him."
Mark,1,21,"And they went into K’far-Nachum [town of comfort] ; and immediately on the Shabbat [rest] day he entered into the synagogue, and taught."
Mark,1,22,"And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the Torah-teachers (Scribes)."
Mark,1,23,"And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean Spirit [Ruach] ; and he cried out,"
Mark,1,24,"Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with you i , you i Yeshua [God is Salvation] of Natzeret [one separated] ? are you i come to destroy us? I know you i who you i are, the Holy One of God-Theos."
Mark,1,25,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] rebuked him, saying, Hold your i peace, and come out of him."
Mark,1,26,"And when the unclean Spirit [Ruach] had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him."
Mark,1,27,"And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine [is] this? for with authority commands he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him."
Mark,1,28,"And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galil [circuit, district]."
Mark,1,29,"And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Shim’on [he has heard] and Andrew [of a man] , with Ya’akov [heal-grabber] and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced]."
Mark,1,30,"But Shim’on [he has heard] ’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her."
Mark,1,31,"And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them."
Mark,1,32,"And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with demons."
Mark,1,33,And all the city was gathered together at the door.
Mark,1,34,"And he healed many that were sick of different diseases, and cast out many demons; and did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew him."
Mark,1,35,"And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed."
Mark,1,36,And Shim’on [he has heard] and they that were with him followed after him.
Mark,1,37,"And when they had found him, they said unto him, All [men] seek for you i."
Mark,1,38,"And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth."
Mark,1,39,"And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galil [circuit, district] , and cast out demons."
Mark,1,40,"And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If you i will, you i can make me clean."
Mark,1,41,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] , moved with compassion, put forth [his] hand, and touched him, and says unto him, I will; be you i clean."
Mark,1,42,"And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed."
Mark,1,43,"And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;"
Mark,1,44,"And says unto him, See you i say nothing to any man: but go your i way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your i cleansing those things which Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] commanded, for a testimony unto them."
Mark,1,45,"But he went out, and began to publish [it] much, and to blaze (to make known; proclaim) abroad the matter, insomuch that Yeshua [God is Salvation] could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter."
Mark,2,1,And again he entered into K’far-Nachum [town of comfort] after [some] days; and it was noised that he was in the house.
Mark,2,2,"And immediately many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive [them] , no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them."
Mark,2,3,"And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four."
Mark,2,4,"And when they could not come near unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken [it] up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay."
Mark,2,5,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, your i sins be forgiven you i."
Mark,2,6,"But there were certain of the Torah-teachers (Scribes) sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,"
Mark,2,7,Why does this [man] thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God-Theos only?
Mark,2,8,"And immediately when Yeshua [God is Salvation] perceived in his Spirit [Ruach] that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason you 2f these things in your hearts?"
Mark,2,9,"Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, [You 1s ] sins be forgiven you i ; or to say, Arise, and take up your i bed, and walk?"
Mark,2,10,"But that you 2f may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins, (he says to the sick of the palsy,)"
Mark,2,11,"I say unto you i , Arise, and take up your i bed, and go your i way into your i house."
Mark,2,12,"And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God-Theos, saying, We never saw it on this fashion."
Mark,2,13,"And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them."
Mark,2,14,"And as he passed by, he saw Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] the [son] of Bar-Halfai [son of “changing”] sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him."
Mark,2,15,"And it came to pass, that, as Yeshua [God is Salvation] sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Yeshua [God is Salvation] and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him."
Mark,2,16,"And when the Torah-teachers (Scribes) and P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eats and drink with publicans and sinners?"
Mark,2,17,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] heard [it] , he says unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
Mark,2,18,"And the disciples of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] and of the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] and of the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] fast, but your i disciples fast not?"
Mark,2,19,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
Mark,2,20,"But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days."
Mark,2,21,"No man also sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up takes away from the old, and the rent is made worse."
Mark,2,22,"And no man puts New Wine into old bottles: else the New Wine does burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but New Wine must be put into new bottles."
Mark,2,23,"And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the Shabbat [rest] day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn."
Mark,2,24,"And the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] said unto him, Behold, why do they on the Shabbat [rest] day that which is not lawful?"
Mark,2,25,"And he said unto them, Have you 2f never read what David [Beloved] did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?"
Mark,2,26,"How he went into the house of God-Theos in the days of Avyatar [my father is great] the High Priest, and did eat the showbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?"
Mark,2,27,"And he said unto them, The Shabbat [rest] was made for man, and not man for the Shabbat [rest]:"
Mark,2,28,Therefore the Son of Man is Lord - Kurios also of the Shabbat [rest].
Mark,3,1,And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.
Mark,3,2,"And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the Shabbat [rest] day; that they might accuse him."
Mark,3,3,"And he says unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth."
Mark,3,4,"And he says unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the Shabbat [rest] days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace."
Mark,3,5,"And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he says unto the man, Stretch forth your i hand. And he stretched [it] out: and his hand was restored whole as the other."
Mark,3,6,"And the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] went forth, and immediately took counsel with the Herod [heroic] ’s Party against him, how they might destroy him."
Mark,3,7,"But Yeshua [God is Salvation] withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galil [circuit, district] followed him, and from Y’hudah [praised],"
Mark,3,8,"And from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and from Edom (Idumaea) [red] , and [from] beyond Yarden [descender] ; and they about Tzor [a rock] and Tzidon [hunting] , a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him."
Mark,3,9,"And he spoke to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him."
Mark,3,10,"For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues."
Mark,3,11,"And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, you i are the Son of God-The Father!"
Mark,3,12,And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
Mark,3,13,"And he goes up into a mountain, and calls [unto him] whom he would: and they came unto him."
Mark,3,14,"And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,"
Mark,3,15,"And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out demons:"
Mark,3,16,And Shim’on [he has heard] he surnamed Kefa [pebble];
Mark,3,17,"And Ya’akov [heal-grabber] the [son] of Zavdai [Yah has bestowed] , and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the brother of Ya’akov [heal-grabber] ; and he surnamed them B’nei-Regesh [sons of thunder] , which is, The sons of thunder:"
Mark,3,18,"And Andrew [of a man] , and Philip [friend of horses] , and Bartholomew, and Mattityahu [gift of Yah] , and T’oma [twin] , and Ya’akov [heal-grabber] Bar-Halfai [son of “changing”], and Taddai [possib. Heart], and Shim’on [he has heard] the Kena’ani [Merchants],"
Mark,3,19,"And Y’hudah [praised] From K’riot [cities] , which also betrayed him: and they went into an house."
Mark,3,20,"And the multitude comes together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread."
Mark,3,21,"And when his friends heard [of it] , they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself."
Mark,3,22,"And the Torah-teachers (Scribes) which came down from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] said, He has Beelzebub, and by the prince of the demons casts he out demons."
Mark,3,23,"And he called them [unto him] , and said unto them in parables, How can Satan [the adversary] cast out Satan [the adversary]?"
Mark,3,24,"And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand."
Mark,3,25,"And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand."
Mark,3,26,"And if Satan [the adversary] rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but has an end."
Mark,3,27,"No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil (plunder; prey; booty) his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil (plunder; prey; booty) his house."
Mark,3,28,"Truly I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies which soever they shall blaspheme:"
Mark,3,29,"But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] has never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:"
Mark,3,30,"Because they said, He has an unclean Spirit [Ruach]."
Mark,3,31,"There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him."
Mark,3,32,"And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, you i mother and your i brethren without seek for you i."
Mark,3,33,"And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?"
Mark,3,34,"And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!"
Mark,3,35,"For whosoever shall do the will of God-Theos, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother."
Mark,4,1,"And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land."
Mark,4,2,"And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,"
Mark,4,3,"Listen; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:"
Mark,4,4,"And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up."
Mark,4,5,"And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:"
Mark,4,6,"But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away."
Mark,4,7,"And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit."
Mark,4,8,"And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred."
Mark,4,9,"And he said unto them, He that has ears to hear, let him hear."
Mark,4,10,"And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable."
Mark,4,11,"And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God-Theos: but unto them that are without, all [these] things are done in parables:"
Mark,4,12,"That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and [their] sins should be forgiven them."
Mark,4,13,"And he said unto them, Know you 2f not this parable? and how then will you 2f know all parables?"
Mark,4,14,The sower sows the word.
Mark,4,15,"And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan [the adversary] comes immediately, and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts."
Mark,4,16,"And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;"
Mark,4,17,"And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution arises for the word’s sake, immediately they are offended."
Mark,4,18,"And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,"
Mark,4,19,"And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful."
Mark,4,20,"And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive [it] , and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred."
Mark,4,21,"And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?"
Mark,4,22,"For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad."
Mark,4,23,"If any man have ears to hear, let him hear."
Mark,4,24,"And he said unto them, Take heed what you 2f hear: with what measure you 2f measure (deal out) , it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given."
Mark,4,25,"For he that has, to him shall be given: and he that has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has."
Mark,4,26,"And he said, So is the kingdom of God-Theos, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;"
Mark,4,27,"And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knows not how."
Mark,4,28,"For the earth brings forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear."
Mark,4,29,"But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest is come."
Mark,4,30,"And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God-Theos? or with what comparison shall we compare it?"
Mark,4,31," [It is] like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:"
Mark,4,32,"But when it is sown, it grows up, and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it."
Mark,4,33,"And with many such parables spoke he the word unto them, as they were able to hear [it]."
Mark,4,34,"But without a parable spoke he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples."
Mark,4,35,"And the same day, when the even was come, he says unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side."
Mark,4,36,"And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships."
Mark,4,37,"And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full."
Mark,4,38,"And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, care you i not that we perish?"
Mark,4,39,"And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm."
Mark,4,40,"And he said unto them, Why are you 2f so fearful? how is it that you 2f have no faith?"
Mark,4,41,"And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
Mark,5,1,"And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes’ [those who come from pilgrimage or fight]."
Mark,5,2,"And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean Spirit [Ruach],"
Mark,5,3,"Who had [his] dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:"
Mark,5,4,"Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any [man] tame him."
Mark,5,5,"And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones."
Mark,5,6,"But when he saw Yeshua [God is Salvation] afar off, he ran and worshipped him,"
Mark,5,7,"And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with you i , Yeshua [God is Salvation], [you i ] Son of the most high God-Theos? I adjure you i by God-Theos, that you i torment me not."
Mark,5,8,"For he said unto him, Come out of the man, [you i ] unclean Spirit [Ruach]."
Mark,5,9,"And he asked him, What [is] your i name? And he answered, saying, My name [is] Legion: for we are many."
Mark,5,10,And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
Mark,5,11,Now there was there near unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.
Mark,5,12,"And all the demons besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them."
Mark,5,13,"And forthwith Yeshua [God is Salvation] gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea."
Mark,5,14,"And they that fed the swine fled, and told [it] in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done."
Mark,5,15,"And they come to Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid."
Mark,5,16,"And they that saw [it] told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and [also] concerning the swine."
Mark,5,17,And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.
Mark,5,18,"And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him."
Mark,5,19,"However Yeshua [God is Salvation] suffered him not, but says unto him, Go home to your i friends, and tell them how great things the Lord - Kurios has done for you i , and has had compassion on you i."
Mark,5,20,"And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis [The 10-Towns] how great things Yeshua [God is Salvation] had done for him: and all [men] did marvel."
Mark,5,21,"And when Yeshua [God is Salvation] was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was near unto the sea."
Mark,5,22,"And, behold, there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue, Ya’ir [God enlightens] by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,"
Mark,5,23,"And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death: [I pray you i ], come and lay your i hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live."
Mark,5,24,"And [Yeshua [God is Salvation]] went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him."
Mark,5,25,"And a certain woman, which had an issue (what comes forth) of blood twelve years,"
Mark,5,26,"And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,"
Mark,5,27,"When she had heard of Yeshua [God is Salvation] , came in the press behind, and touched his garment."
Mark,5,28,"For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole."
Mark,5,29,And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in [her] body that she was healed of that plague.
Mark,5,30,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] , immediately knowing in himself that virtue (power) had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?"
Mark,5,31,"And his disciples said unto him, you i see the multitude thronging you i , and say you i , Who touched me?"
Mark,5,32,And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
Mark,5,33,"But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth."
Mark,5,34,"And he said unto her, Daughter, your i faith has made you i whole; go in peace, and be whole of your i plague."
Mark,5,35,"While he yet spoke, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s [house certain] which said, You 1s daughter is dead: why trouble you i the Master any further?"
Mark,5,36,"As soon as Yeshua [God is Salvation] heard the word that was spoken, he says unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe."
Mark,5,37,"And he suffered no man to follow him, save Kefa [pebble] , and Ya’akov [heal-grabber] , and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the brother of Ya’akov [heal-grabber]."
Mark,5,38,"And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sees the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly."
Mark,5,39,"And when he was come in, he says unto them, Why make you 2f this ado, and weep? the girl is not dead, but sleeps."
Mark,5,40,"And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he takes the father and the mother of the girl, and them that were with him, and enters in where the girl was lying."
Mark,5,41,"And he took the girl by the hand, and said unto her, Talita, kumi!; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto you i , arise."
Mark,5,42,"And immediately the girl arose, and walked; for she was [of the age] of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment."
Mark,5,43,And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
Mark,6,1,"And he went out from there, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him."
Mark,6,2,"And when the Shabbat [rest] day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing [him] were astonished, saying, From from what place has this [man] these things? and what wisdom [is] this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?"
Mark,6,3,"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Miryam [waters of strength] , the brother of Ya’akov [heal-grabber] , and Yosi [may God multiply] , and of Y’hudah [praised] , and Shim’on [he has heard] ? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him."
Mark,6,4,"But Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own family, and in his own house."
Mark,6,5,"And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed [them]."
Mark,6,6,"And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching."
Mark,6,7,"And he called [unto him] the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;"
Mark,6,8,"And commanded them that they should take nothing for [their] journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in [their] purse:"
Mark,6,9,But [be] shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.
Mark,6,10,"And he said unto them, In what place soever you 2f enter into an house, there abide till you 2f depart from that place."
Mark,6,11,"And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when you 2f depart there, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Truly I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for S’dom [Burning] and ‘Amorah [a ruined heap] in the day of judgment, than for that city."
Mark,6,12,"And they went out, and preached that men should repent."
Mark,6,13,"And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed [them]."
Mark,6,14,"And king Herod [heroic] heard [of him]; (for his name was spread abroad) and he said, That Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him."
Mark,6,15,"Others said, That it is Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] . And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets."
Mark,6,16,"But when Herod [heroic] heard [thereof] , he said, It is Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead."
Mark,6,17,"For Herod [heroic] himself had sent forth and laid hold upon Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , and bound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip [friend of horses] ’s wife: for he had married her."
Mark,6,18,"For Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] had said unto Herod [heroic] , It is not lawful for you i to have your i brother’s wife."
Mark,6,19,"Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:"
Mark,6,20,"For Herod [heroic] feared Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly."
Mark,6,21,"And when a convenient (fit; appropriate; proper (one’s own; peculiar; particular)) day was come, that Herod [heroic] on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief [estates] of Galil [circuit, district];"
Mark,6,22,"And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod [heroic] and them that sat with him, the king said unto the girl, Ask of me whatsoever you i will, and I will give [it] you i."
Mark,6,23,"And he swore unto her, Whatsoever you i shall ask of me, I will give [it] you i , unto the half of my kingdom."
Mark,6,24,"And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the Baptist."
Mark,6,25,"And she came in immediately with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that you i give me by and by in a charger (a large platter or dish) the head of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the Baptist."
Mark,6,26,"And the king was exceeding sorry; [yet] for his oath’s sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her."
Mark,6,27,"And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,"
Mark,6,28,"And brought his head in a charger (a large platter or dish) , and gave it to the girl: and the girl gave it to her mother."
Mark,6,29,"And when his disciples heard [of it] , they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb."
Mark,6,30,"And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught."
Mark,6,31,"And he said unto them, Come you 2f yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat."
Mark,6,32,And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
Mark,6,33,"And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot there out of all cities, and outwent (went before; went faster) them, and came together unto him."
Mark,6,34,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] , when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things."
Mark,6,35,"And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time [is] far passed:"
Mark,6,36,"Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat."
Mark,6,37,"He answered and said unto them, Give you 2f them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?"
Mark,6,38,"He says unto them, How many loaves have you 2f ? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes."
Mark,6,39,And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.
Mark,6,40,"And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties."
Mark,6,41,"And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) , and broke the loaves, and gave [them] to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all."
Mark,6,42,"And they did all eat, and were filled."
Mark,6,43,"And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes."
Mark,6,44,And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.
Mark,6,45,"And immediately he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Beit-Tzaidah [house of fish] , while he sent away the people."
Mark,6,46,"And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray."
Mark,6,47,"And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land."
Mark,6,48,"And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he comes unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them."
Mark,6,49,"But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a Spirit [Ruach] , and cried out:"
Mark,6,50,"For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and says unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid."
Mark,6,51,"And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered."
Mark,6,52,For they considered not [the miracle] of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.
Mark,6,53,"And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Kinneret [a harp] , and drew to the shore."
Mark,6,54,"And when they were come out of the ship, immediately they knew him,"
Mark,6,55,"And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was."
Mark,6,56,"And to wherever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole."
Mark,7,1,"Then came together unto him the P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] , and certain of the Torah-teachers (Scribes) , which came from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Mark,7,2,"And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault."
Mark,7,3,"For the P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] , and all the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , except they wash [their] hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders."
Mark,7,4,"And [when they come] from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, [as] the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables."
Mark,7,5,"Then the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] and Torah-teachers (Scribes) asked him, Why walk not your i disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?"
Mark,7,6,"He answered and said unto them, Well has Yesha’yahu [Yah is salvation] prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honours me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from me."
Mark,7,7,"However in vain do they worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men."
Mark,7,8,"For laying aside the commandment of God-Theos, you 2f hold the tradition of men, [as] the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things you 2f do."
Mark,7,9,"And he said unto them, Full well you 2f reject the commandment of God-Theos, that you 2f may keep your own tradition."
Mark,7,10,"For Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] said, Honour your i father and your i mother; and, Whoso curses father or mother, let him die the death:"
Mark,7,11,"But you 2f say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, [It is] Karban [as a gift to God] , that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever you i might be profited by me; [he shall be free]."
Mark,7,12,"And you 2f suffer (allow, to let, permit) him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;"
Mark,7,13,"Making the word of God-Theos of none effect through your tradition, which you 2f have delivered: and many such like things do you 2f."
Mark,7,14,"And when he had called all the people [unto him] , he said unto them, Listen unto me every one [of you] , and understand:"
Mark,7,15,"There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man."
Mark,7,16,"If any man have ears to hear, let him hear."
Mark,7,17,"And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable."
Mark,7,18,"And he says unto them, Are you 2f so without understanding also? Do you 2f not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without enters into the man, [it] cannot defile him;"
Mark,7,19,"Because it enters not into his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the draught, purging all meats?"
Mark,7,20,"And he said, That which comes out of the man, that defiles the man."
Mark,7,21,"For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,"
Mark,7,22,"Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness (being lustful, loose or lewd; promoting lustful desires in others), an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:"
Mark,7,23,"All these evil things come from within, and defile the man."
Mark,7,24,"And from there he arose, and went into the borders of Tzor [a rock] and Tzidon [hunting] , and entered into an house, and would have no man know [it] : but he could not be hid."
Mark,7,25,"For a [certain] woman, whose young daughter had an unclean Spirit [Ruach] , heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:"
Mark,7,26,"The woman was a Greek [unstable: the miry one], a Syro-phoenician [Syria (meaning disputed, blood red)] by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter."
Mark,7,27,"But Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast [it] unto the dogs."
Mark,7,28,"And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord - Kurios: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs."
Mark,7,29,"And he said unto her, For this saying go your i way; the devil is gone out of your i daughter."
Mark,7,30,"And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed."
Mark,7,31,"And again, departing from the coasts of Tzor [a rock] and Tzidon [hunting] , he came unto the sea of Galil [circuit, district] , through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis [The 10-Towns]."
Mark,7,32,"And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) him to put his hand upon him."
Mark,7,33,"And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;"
Mark,7,34,"And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and says unto him, Hippatach!, that is, Be opened."
Mark,7,35,"And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plain."
Mark,7,36,"And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published [it];"
Mark,7,37,"And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He has done all things well: he makes both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak."
Mark,8,1,"In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Yeshua [God is Salvation] called his disciples [unto him] , and says unto them,"
Mark,8,2,"I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:"
Mark,8,3,"And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will give up by the way: for different of them came from far."
Mark,8,4,"And his disciples answered him, From what place can a man satisfy these [men] with bread here in the wilderness?"
Mark,8,5,"And he asked them, How many loaves have you 2f ? And they said, Seven."
Mark,8,6,"And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave to his disciples to set before [them] ; and they did set [them] before the people."
Mark,8,7,"And they had a few small fishes: and he Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) , and commanded to set them also before [them]."
Mark,8,8,"So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken [meat] that was left seven baskets."
Mark,8,9,And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
Mark,8,10,"And immediately he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanuta [a bucket; a branch]."
Mark,8,11,"And the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him."
Mark,8,12,"And he sighed deeply in his Spirit [Ruach] , and says, Why does this generation seek after a sign? truly I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation."
Mark,8,13,"And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side."
Mark,8,14,"Now [the disciples] had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf."
Mark,8,15,"And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] , and [of] the leaven of Herod [heroic]."
Mark,8,16,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have no bread."
Mark,8,17,"And when Yeshua [God is Salvation] knew [it] , he says unto them, Why reason you 2f , because you 2f have no bread? perceive you 2f not yet, neither understand? have you 2f your heart yet hardened?"
Mark,8,18,"Having eyes, see you 2f not? and having ears, hear you 2f not? and do you 2f not remember?"
Mark,8,19,"When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took you 2f up? They say unto him, Twelve."
Mark,8,20,"And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took you 2f up? And they said, Seven."
Mark,8,21,"And he said unto them, How is it that you 2f do not understand?"
Mark,8,22,"And he comes to Beit-Tzaidah [house of fish] ; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him."
Mark,8,23,"And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought."
Mark,8,24,"And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking."
Mark,8,25,"After that he put [his] hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly."
Mark,8,26,"And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell [it] to any in the town."
Mark,8,27,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea [severed] Philippi [lover of horses] : and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?"
Mark,8,28,"And they answered, Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] the Baptist: but some [say] , Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] ; and others, One of the prophets."
Mark,8,29,"And he says unto them, But whom say you 2f that I am? And Kefa [pebble] answer and says unto him, you i are the Moshiach [Messiah]."
Mark,8,30,And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
Mark,8,31,"And he began to teach them, that the Son of Man must suffer (allow, to let, permit) many things, and be rejected of the elders, and [of] the chief priests, and Torah-teachers (Scribes) , and be killed, and after three days rise again."
Mark,8,32,"And he spoke that saying openly. And Kefa [pebble] took him, and began to rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) him."
Mark,8,33,"But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Kefa [pebble] , saying, Get you i behind me, Satan [the adversary] : for you i savour not the things that be of God-Theos, but the things that be of men."
Mark,8,34,"And when he had called the people [unto him] with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his stake (cross) , and follow me."
Mark,8,35,"For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the Gospel (joyful message) ’s, the same shall save it."
Mark,8,36,"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"
Mark,8,37,Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
Mark,8,38,"Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."
Mark,9,1,"And he said unto them, Truly I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God-Theos come with power."
Mark,9,2,"And after six days Yeshua [God is Salvation] takes [with him] Kefa [pebble] , and Ya’akov [heal-grabber] , and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , and leads them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them."
Mark,9,3,"And his clothing became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller (washer and/or bleacher of clothes) on earth can white them."
Mark,9,4,And there appeared unto them Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] with Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] : and they were talking with Yeshua [God is Salvation].
Mark,9,5,"And Kefa [pebble] answered and said to Yeshua [God is Salvation] , Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for you i , and one for Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , and one for Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah]."
Mark,9,6,For he did not know not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
Mark,9,7,"And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him."
Mark,9,8,"And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Yeshua [God is Salvation] only with themselves."
Mark,9,9,"And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of Man were risen from the dead."
Mark,9,10,"And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean."
Mark,9,11,"And they asked him, saying, Why say the Torah-teachers (Scribes) that Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] must first come?"
Mark,9,12,"And he answered and told them, Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] truly comes first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of Man, that he must suffer (allow, to let, permit) many things, and be set at nothing (despised)."
Mark,9,13,"But I say unto you, That Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed (choose; be inclined to do) , as it is written of him."
Mark,9,14,"And when he came to [his] disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the Torah-teachers (Scribes) questioning with them."
Mark,9,15,"And immediately all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to [him] saluted him."
Mark,9,16,"And he asked the Torah-teachers (Scribes) , What question you 2f with them?"
Mark,9,17,"And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto you i my son, which has a dumb Spirit [Ruach];"
Mark,9,18,"And wherever he takes him, he tears him: and he foams, and gnashes with his teeth, and pines away: and I spoke to your i disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not."
Mark,9,19,"He answer him, and says, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer (allow, to let, permit) you? bring him unto me."
Mark,9,20,"And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, immediately the Spirit [Ruach] tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming."
Mark,9,21,"And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child."
Mark,9,22,"And ofttimes it has cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if you i can do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us."
Mark,9,23,"Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto him, If you i can believe, all things [are] possible to him that believes."
Mark,9,24,"And immediately the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord - Kurios, I believe; help you i my unbelief."
Mark,9,25,"When Yeshua [God is Salvation] saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul Spirit [Ruach] , saying unto him, [you i ] dumb and deaf Spirit [Ruach] , I charge you i , come out of him, and enter no more into him."
Mark,9,26,"And [the Spirit [Ruach] ] cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead."
Mark,9,27,"But Yeshua [God is Salvation] took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose."
Mark,9,28,"And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?"
Mark,9,29,"And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting."
Mark,9,30,"And they departed there, and passed through Galil [circuit, district] ; and he would not that any man should know [it]."
Mark,9,31,"For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of Man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day."
Mark,9,32,"But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him."
Mark,9,33,"And he came to K’far-Nachum [town of comfort] : and being in the house he asked them, What was it that you 2f disputed among yourselves by the way?"
Mark,9,34,"But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who [should be] the greatest."
Mark,9,35,"And he sat down, and called the twelve, and says unto them, If any man desire to be first, [the same] shall be last of all, and slave of all."
Mark,9,36,"And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,"
Mark,9,37,"Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receives me: and whosoever shall receive me, receives not me, but him that sent me."
Mark,9,38,"And Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out demons in your i name, and he follows not us: and we forbad him, because he follows not us."
Mark,9,39,"But Yeshua [God is Salvation] said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me."
Mark,9,40,For he that is not against us is on our part.
Mark,9,41,"For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you 2f belong to Moshiach [Messiah] , truly I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward."
Mark,9,42,"And whosoever shall offend (make angry; make one stumble; violate) one of [these] little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea."
Mark,9,43,"And if your i hand offend (make angry; make one stumble; violate) you i , cut it off: it is better for you i to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:"
Mark,9,44,"Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched."
Mark,9,45,"And if your i foot offend (make angry; make one stumble; violate) you i , cut it off: it is better for you i to enter lame (crippled in the feet) into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:"
Mark,9,46,"Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched."
Mark,9,47,"And if your i eye offend (make angry; make one stumble; violate) you i , pluck it out: it is better for you i to enter into the kingdom of God-Theos with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:"
Mark,9,48,"Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched."
Mark,9,49,"For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt."
Mark,9,50,"Salt [is] good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, which will you 2f season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another."
Mark,10,1,"And he arose from there, and comes into the coasts of Y’hudah [praised] by the farther side of Yarden [descender] : and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont (used to; in the habit of) , he taught them again."
Mark,10,2,"And the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away [his] wife? tempting him."
Mark,10,3,"And he answered and said unto them, What did Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] command you?"
Mark,10,4,"And they said, Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put [her] away."
Mark,10,5,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto them, For the blindness of your heart he wrote you this precept."
Mark,10,6,But from the beginning of the creation God-Theos made them male and female.
Mark,10,7,"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave (split open; cut open; divide) to his wife;"
Mark,10,8,"And they two shall be one flesh: so then they are no more two, but one flesh."
Mark,10,9,"What therefore God-Theos has joined together, let not man put asunder."
Mark,10,10,And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same [matter].
Mark,10,11,"And he says unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, commit adultery against her."
Mark,10,12,"And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she commit adultery."
Mark,10,13,"And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and [his] disciples rebuked those that brought [them]."
Mark,10,14,"But when Yeshua [God is Salvation] saw [it] , he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer (allow, to let, permit) the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God-Theos."
Mark,10,15,"Truly I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God-Theos as a little child, he shall not enter in it."
Mark,10,16,"And he took them up in his arms, put [his] hands upon them, and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) them."
Mark,10,17,"And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
Mark,10,18,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto him, Why call you i me good? [there is] none good but one, [that is] , God-Theos."
Mark,10,19,"you i know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour your i father and mother."
Mark,10,20,"And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth."
Mark,10,21,"Then Yeshua [God is Salvation] beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing you i lack: go your i way, sell whatsoever you i have, and give to the poor, and you i shall have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the stake (cross) , and follow me."
Mark,10,22,"And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions."
Mark,10,23,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] looked round about, and says unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God-Theos!"
Mark,10,24,"And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Yeshua [God is Salvation] answer again, and says unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God-Theos!"
Mark,10,25,"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God-Theos."
Mark,10,26,"And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?"
Mark,10,27,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] looking upon them says, With men [it is] impossible, but not with God-Theos: for with God-Theos all things are possible."
Mark,10,28,"Then Kefa [pebble] began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed you i."
Mark,10,29,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said, Truly I say unto you, There is no man that has left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the Gospel (joyful message)’s,"
Mark,10,30,"But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life."
Mark,10,31,But many [that are] first shall be last; and the last first.
Mark,10,32,"And they were in the way going up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; and Yeshua [God is Salvation] went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,"
Mark,10,33," [Saying] , Behold, we go up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] ; and the Son of Man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the Torah-teachers (Scribes) ; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Goyim [Gentiles]:"
Mark,10,34,"And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again."
Mark,10,35,"And Ya’akov [heal-grabber] and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , the sons of Zavdai [Yah has bestowed] , come unto him, saying, Master, we would that you i hould do for us whatsoever we shall desire."
Mark,10,36,"And he said unto them, What would you 2f that I should do for you?"
Mark,10,37,"They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on your i right hand, and the other on your i left hand, in your i glory."
Mark,10,38,"But Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto them, You 2f know not what you 2f ask: can you 2f drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"
Mark,10,39,"And they said unto him, We can. And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto them, You 2f shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall you 2f be baptized:"
Mark,10,40,But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not my to give; but [it shall be given to them] for whom it is prepared.
Mark,10,41,"And when the ten heard [it] , they began to be much displeased with Ya’akov [heal-grabber] and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced]."
Mark,10,42,"But Yeshua [God is Salvation] called them [to him] , and says unto them, You 2f know that they which are accounted to rule over the Goyim [Gentiles] exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them."
Mark,10,43,"But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:"
Mark,10,44,"And whosoever of you will be the most important, shall be slave of all."
Mark,10,45,"For even the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."
Mark,10,46,"And they came to Yericho [Its Moon] : and as he went out of Yericho [Its Moon] with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bar-Timai (son of the unclean) , sat by the highway side begging."
Mark,10,47,"And when he heard that it was Yeshua [God is Salvation] of Natzeret [one separated] , he began to cry out, and say, Yeshua [God is Salvation], [you i ] Son of David [Beloved] , have mercy on me."
Mark,10,48,"And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, [you i ] Son of David [Beloved] , have mercy on me."
Mark,10,49,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calls you i."
Mark,10,50,"And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
Mark,10,51,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto him, What will you i that I should do unto you i ? The blind man said unto him, Lord - Kurios, that I might receive my sight."
Mark,10,52,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto him, Go your i way; you i faith has made you i whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Yeshua [God is Salvation] in the way."
Mark,11,1,"And when they came near to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , unto Beit-Pagei [house of unripe figs] and Beit-Anyah [house of figs] , at the Mount of Olives, he send forth two of his disciples,"
Mark,11,2,"And says unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as you 2f be entered into it, you 2f shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring [him]."
Mark,11,3,"And if any man say unto you, Why do you 2f this? say you 2f that the Lord - Kurios has need of him; and immediately he will send him here."
Mark,11,4,"And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him."
Mark,11,5,"And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do you 2f , loosing the colt?"
Mark,11,6,And they said unto them even as Yeshua [God is Salvation] had commanded: and they let them go.
Mark,11,7,"And they brought the colt to Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him."
Mark,11,8,"And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and scattered [them] in the way."
Mark,11,9,"And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [is] he that comes in the name of the Lord - Kurios:"
Mark,11,10,"Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [be] the kingdom of our father David [Beloved] , that comes in the name of the Lord - Kurios: Hosanna in the highest."
Mark,11,11,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] entered into Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Beit-Anyah [house of figs] with the twelve."
Mark,11,12,"And on the morrow, when they were come from Beit-Anyah [house of figs] , he was hungry:"
Mark,11,13,"And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if perhaps (maybe) he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not [yet]."
Mark,11,14,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of you i hereafter forever. And his disciples heard [it]."
Mark,11,15,"And they come to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : and Yeshua [God is Salvation] went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;"
Mark,11,16,"And would not suffer (allow, to let, permit) that any man should carry [any] vessel through the temple."
Mark,11,17,"And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but you 2f have made it a den of thieves."
Mark,11,18,"And the Torah-teachers (Scribes) and chief priests heard [it] , and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine."
Mark,11,19,"And when even was come, he went out of the city."
Mark,11,20,"And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots."
Mark,11,21,"And Kefa [pebble] calling to remembrance says unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which you i cursed is withered away."
Mark,11,22,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering says unto them, Have faith in God-Theos."
Mark,11,23,"For truly I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be you i removed, and be you i cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he says shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he says."
Mark,11,24,"Therefore I say unto you, What things soever you 2f desire, when you 2f pray, believe that you 2f receive [them] , and you 2f shall have [them]."
Mark,11,25,"And when you 2f stand praying, forgive, if you 2f have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."
Mark,11,26,"But if you 2f do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses."
Mark,11,27,"And they come again to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the Torah-teachers (Scribes) , and the elders,"
Mark,11,28,"And say unto him, By what authority do you i these things? and who gave you i this authority to do these things?"
Mark,11,29,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
Mark,11,30,"The baptism of Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , was [it] from heaven, or of men? answer me."
Mark,11,31,"And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you 2f not believe him?"
Mark,11,32,"But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all [men] counted Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , that he was a prophet indeed."
Mark,11,33,"And they answered and said unto Yeshua [God is Salvation] , We cannot tell. And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering says unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things."
Mark,12,1,"And he began to speak unto them by parables. A [certain] man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about [it] , and excavated [a place for] the winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country."
Mark,12,2,"And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a slave, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard."
Mark,12,3,"And they caught [him] , and beat him, and sent [him] away empty."
Mark,12,4,"And again he sent unto them another slave; and at him they cast stones, and wounded [him] in the head, and sent [him] away shamefully handled."
Mark,12,5,"And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some."
Mark,12,6,"Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son."
Mark,12,7,"But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours."
Mark,12,8,"And they took him, and killed [him] , and cast [him] out of the vineyard."
Mark,12,9,"What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others."
Mark,12,10,And have you 2f not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:
Mark,12,11,"This was the Lord - Kurios’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?"
Mark,12,12,"And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way."
Mark,12,13,"And they send unto him certain of the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] and of the Herod [heroic] ’s Party, to catch him in [his] words."
Mark,12,14,"And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that you i are true, and care for no man: for you i regard not the person of men, but teaches the way of God-Theos in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar [venerable] , or not?"
Mark,12,15,"Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt you 2f me? bring me a penny, that I may see [it]."
Mark,12,16,"And they brought [it] . And he says unto them, Whose [is] this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar [venerable] ’s."
Mark,12,17,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering said unto them, Render to Caesar [venerable] the things that are Caesar [venerable] ’s, and to God-Theos the things that are God-Theos’s. And they marvelled at him."
Mark,12,18,"Then come unto him the Tz’dukim (Sadducees) [followers of the right] , which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,"
Mark,12,19,"Master, Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave [his] wife [behind him] , and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother."
Mark,12,20,"Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed."
Mark,12,21,"And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise."
Mark,12,22,"And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also."
Mark,12,23,"In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife."
Mark,12,24,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering said unto them, Do you 2f not therefore err, because you 2f know not the scriptures, neither the power of God-Theos?"
Mark,12,25,"For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven."
Mark,12,26,"And as touching the dead, that they rise: have you 2f not read in the book of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , how in the bush God-Theos spoke unto him, saying, I [am] the God-Theos of Avraham [Exalted Father] , and the God-Theos of Yitz’khak [Laughter] , and the God-Theos of Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] [Heal of God]?"
Mark,12,27,"He is not the God-Theos of the dead, but the God-Theos of the living: you 2f therefore do greatly err."
Mark,12,28,"And one of the Torah-teachers (Scribes) came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?"
Mark,12,29,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered him, The first of all the commandments [is] , Hear, O Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] ; The Lord - Kurios our God-Theos is one Lord - Kurios:"
Mark,12,30,"And you i shall love the Lord - Kurios your i God-Theos with all your i heart, and with all your i soul, and with all your i mind, and with all your i strength: this [is] the first commandment."
Mark,12,31,"And the second [is] like, [namely] this, you i shall love your i neighbour as yourself. There is none other commandment greater than these."
Mark,12,32,"And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, you i have said the truth: for there is one God-Theos; and there is none other but he:"
Mark,12,33,"And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love [his] neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."
Mark,12,34,"And when Yeshua [God is Salvation] saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, you i are not far from the kingdom of God-Theos. And no man after that dared (was bold enough) ask him [any question]."
Mark,12,35,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the Torah-teachers (Scribes) that Moshiach [Messiah] is the Son of David [Beloved]?"
Mark,12,36,"For David [Beloved] himself said by the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] , The Lord-Yehōvah (Messiah Pre-Incarnate) said to my Lord – (Adon – Lord of the earth) , Sit you i on my right hand, till I make your i enemies your i footstool."
Mark,12,37,David [Beloved] therefore himself calls him Lord - Kurios; and from what place is he [then] his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
Mark,12,38,"And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the Torah-teachers (Scribes) , which love to go in long clothing, and [love] salutations in the marketplaces,"
Mark,12,39,"And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:"
Mark,12,40,"Which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation."
Mark,12,41,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much."
Mark,12,42,"And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing."
Mark,12,43,"And he called [unto him] his disciples, and says unto them, Truly I say unto you, That this poor widow has cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:"
Mark,12,44,"For all [they] did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, [even] all her living."
Mark,13,1,"And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples says unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings [are here]!"
Mark,13,2,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering said unto him, See you i these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."
Mark,13,3,"And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives over against the temple, Kefa [pebble] and Ya’akov [heal-grabber] and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] and Andrew [of a man] asked him privately,"
Mark,13,4,"Tell us, when shall these things be? and what [shall be] the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?"
Mark,13,5,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answering them began to say, Take heed lest any [man] deceive you:"
Mark,13,6,"For many shall come in my name, saying, I am [Moshiach [Messiah] ]; and shall deceive many."
Mark,13,7,"And when you 2f shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be you 2f not troubled: for [such things] must needs be; but the end [shall] not [be] yet."
Mark,13,8,"For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in different places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these [are] the beginnings of sorrows."
Mark,13,9,"But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues you 2f shall be beaten: and you 2f shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them."
Mark,13,10,And the Gospel (joyful message) must first be published among all nations.
Mark,13,11,"But when they shall lead [you] , and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what you 2f shall speak, neither do you 2f premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak you 2f : for it is not you 2f that speak, but the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh]."
Mark,13,12,"Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against [their] parents, and shall cause them to be put to death."
Mark,13,13,"And you 2f shall be hated of all [men] for my name’s sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved."
Mark,13,14,"But when you 2f shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Dani’el [God is Judge] the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that reads understand,) then let them that be in Y’hudah [praised] flee to the mountains:"
Mark,13,15,"And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter [in it] , to take any thing out of his house:"
Mark,13,16,And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.
Mark,13,17,"But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!"
Mark,13,18,And pray you 2f that your flight be not in the winter.
Mark,13,19,"For [in] those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God-Theos created unto this time, neither shall be."
Mark,13,20,"And except that the Lord - Kurios had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he has chosen, he has shortened the days."
Mark,13,21,"And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here [is] Moshiach [Messiah] ; or, lo, [he is] there; believe [him] not:"
Mark,13,22,"For false Christs [messiahs] and false prophets shall rise, and shall show signs and wonders, to seduce, if [it were] possible, even the elect."
Mark,13,23,"But take you 2f heed: behold, I have foretold you all things."
Mark,13,24,"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,"
Mark,13,25,"And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken."
Mark,13,26,And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
Mark,13,27,"And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven."
Mark,13,28,"Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, you 2f know that summer is near:"
Mark,13,29,"So you 2f in like manner, when you 2f shall see these things come to pass, know that it is near, [even] at the doors."
Mark,13,30,"Truly I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done."
Mark,13,31,Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
Mark,13,32,"But of that day and [that] hour knows no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father."
Mark,13,33,"Take you 2f heed, watch and pray: for you 2f know not when the time is."
Mark,13,34," [For the Son of Man is] as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch."
Mark,13,35,"Watch you 2f therefore: for you 2f know not when the master of the house comes, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:"
Mark,13,36,Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
Mark,13,37,"And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch."
Mark,14,1,"After two days was [the feast of] the Passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the Torah-teachers (Scribes) sought how they might take him by craft, and put [him] to death."
Mark,14,2,"But they said, Not on the feast [day] , lest there be an uproar of the people."
Mark,14,3,"And being in Beit-Anyah [house of figs] in the house of Shim’on [he has heard] the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she broke the box, and poured [it] on his head."
Mark,14,4,"And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?"
Mark,14,5,"For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her."
Mark,14,6,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said, Let her alone; why trouble you 2f her? she has wrought a good work on me."
Mark,14,7,"For you 2f have the poor with you always, and whensoever you 2f will you 2f may do them good: but me you 2f have not always."
Mark,14,8,She has done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.
Mark,14,9,"Truly I say unto you, Wheresoever this Gospel (joyful message) shall be preached throughout the whole world, [this] also that she has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her."
Mark,14,10,"And Y’hudah [praised] From K’riot [cities] , one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them."
Mark,14,11,"And when they heard [it] , they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him."
Mark,14,12,"And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the Passover, his disciples said unto him, Where will you i that we go and prepare that you i may eat the Passover?"
Mark,14,13,"And he send forth two of his disciples, and says unto them, Go you 2f into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him."
Mark,14,14,"And wherever he shall go in, say you 2f to the goodman of the house, The Master says, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?"
Mark,14,15,And he will show you a large upper room furnished [and] prepared: there make ready for us.
Mark,14,16,"And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the Passover."
Mark,14,17,And in the evening he comes with the twelve.
Mark,14,18,"And as they sat and did eat, Yeshua [God is Salvation] said, Truly I say unto you, One of you which eats with me shall betray me."
Mark,14,19,"And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, [Is] it I? and another [said, Is] it I?"
Mark,14,20,"And he answered and said unto them, [It is] one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish."
Mark,14,21,"The Son of Man indeed goes, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born."
Mark,14,22,"And as they did eat, Yeshua [God is Salvation] took bread, and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) , and broke [it] , and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body."
Mark,14,23,"And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave [it] to them: and they all drank of it."
Mark,14,24,"And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament (a covenant, ratified in death) , which is shed for many."
Mark,14,25,"Truly I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God-Theos."
Mark,14,26,"And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the Mount of Olives."
Mark,14,27,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto them, All you 2f shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered."
Mark,14,28,"But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galil [circuit, district]."
Mark,14,29,"But Kefa [pebble] said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet [will] not I."
Mark,14,30,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] says unto him, Truly I say unto you i , That this day, [even] in this night, before the cock crow twice, you i shall deny me thrice."
Mark,14,31,"But he spoke the more vehemently, If I should die with you i , I will not deny you i in any wise. Likewise also said they all."
Mark,14,32,"And they came to a place which was named Gat-Sh’manim [Olive Press] : and he says to his disciples, Sit you 2f here, while I shall pray."
Mark,14,33,"And he takes with him Kefa [pebble] and Ya’akov [heal-grabber] and Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;"
Mark,14,34,"And says unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: wait you 2f here, and watch."
Mark,14,35,"And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him."
Mark,14,36,"And he said, Abba, Father, all things [are] possible unto you i ; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what you i will."
Mark,14,37,"And he comes, and finds them sleeping, and says unto Kefa [pebble] , Shim’on [he has heard] , sleep you i ? could not you i watch one hour?"
Mark,14,38,"Watch you 2f and pray, lest you 2f enter into temptation. The Spirit [Ruach] truly [is] ready, but the flesh [is] weak."
Mark,14,39,"And again he went away, and prayed, and spoke the same words."
Mark,14,40,"And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither did not know they what to answer him."
Mark,14,41,"And he comes the third time, and says unto them, Sleep on now, and take [your] rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Mark,14,42,"Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrays me is at hand."
Mark,14,43,"And immediately, while he yet spoke, comes Y’hudah [praised] , one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and rods (clubs) , from the chief priests and the Torah-teachers (Scribes) and the elders."
Mark,14,44,"And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead [him] away safely."
Mark,14,45,"And as soon as he was come, he goes immediately to him, and says, Master, master; and kissed him."
Mark,14,46,"And they laid their hands on him, and took him."
Mark,14,47,"And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and struck a slave of the High Priest, and cut off his ear."
Mark,14,48,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] answered and said unto them, Are you 2f come out, as against a thief, with swords and [with] rods (clubs) to take me?"
Mark,14,49,"I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you 2f took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled."
Mark,14,50,"And they all forsook him, and fled."
Mark,14,51,"And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about [his] naked [body] ; and the young men laid hold on him:"
Mark,14,52,"And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked."
Mark,14,53,And they led Yeshua [God is Salvation] away to the High Priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the Torah-teachers (Scribes).
Mark,14,54,"And Kefa [pebble] followed him afar off, even into the palace of the High Priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire."
Mark,14,55,And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Yeshua [God is Salvation] to put him to death; and found none.
Mark,14,56,"For many bore false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together."
Mark,14,57,"And there arose certain, and bore false witness against him, saying,"
Mark,14,58,"We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands."
Mark,14,59,But neither so did their witness agree together.
Mark,14,60,"And the High Priest stood up in the midst, and asked Yeshua [God is Salvation] , saying, Answer you i nothing? what [is it which] these witness against you i?"
Mark,14,61,"But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the High Priest asked him, and said unto him, Are you i the Moshiach [Messiah] , the Son of the Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous)?"
Mark,14,62,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] said, I am: and you 2f shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven."
Mark,14,63,"Then the High Priest rent his clothes, and says, What need we any further witnesses?"
Mark,14,64,You 2f have heard the blasphemy: what think you 2f ? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
Mark,14,65,"And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet (to strike with a clenched fist) him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands."
Mark,14,66,"And as Kefa [pebble] was beneath in the palace, there comes one of the maids of the High Priest:"
Mark,14,67,"And when she saw Kefa [pebble] warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And you i also were with Yeshua [God is Salvation] of Natzeret [one separated]."
Mark,14,68,"But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what you i say. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew."
Mark,14,69,"And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is [one] of them."
Mark,14,70,"And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Kefa [pebble] , Surely you i are [one] of them: for you i are a Galilaean [circle] , and you i speech agree [thereto]."
Mark,14,71,"But he began to curse and to swear, [saying] , I know not this man of whom you 2f speak."
Mark,14,72,"And the second time the cock crew. And Kefa [pebble] called to mind the word that Yeshua [God is Salvation] said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, you i shall deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept."
Mark,15,1,"And immediately in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and Torah-teachers (Scribes) and the whole council, and bound Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and carried [him] away, and delivered [him] to Pilate [armed with a spear]."
Mark,15,2,"And Pilate [armed with a spear] asked him, Are you i the King of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] ? And he answering said unto him, you i say [it]."
Mark,15,3,And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
Mark,15,4,"And Pilate [armed with a spear] asked him again, saying, Answer you i nothing? behold how many things they witness against you i."
Mark,15,5,But Yeshua [God is Salvation] yet answered nothing; so that Pilate [armed with a spear] marvelled.
Mark,15,6,"Now at [that] feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired."
Mark,15,7,"And there was [one] named Bar-Abba [son of a father], [which lay] bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection."
Mark,15,8,And the multitude crying aloud began to desire [him to do] as he had ever done unto them.
Mark,15,9,"But Pilate [armed with a spear] answered them, saying, Will you 2f that I release unto you the King of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah]?"
Mark,15,10,For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
Mark,15,11,"But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Bar-Abba [son of a father] unto them."
Mark,15,12,"And Pilate [armed with a spear] answered and said again unto them, What will you 2f then that I shall do [unto him] whom you 2f call the King of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah]?"
Mark,15,13,"And they cried out again, Crucify him."
Mark,15,14,"Then Pilate [armed with a spear] said unto them, Why, what evil has he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him."
Mark,15,15,"And [so] Pilate [armed with a spear] , willing to content the people, released Bar-Abba [son of a father] unto them, and delivered Yeshua [God is Salvation] , when he had scourged [him] , to be crucified."
Mark,15,16,"And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium [head-quarters] ; and they call together the whole band."
Mark,15,17,"And they clothed him with purple, and braided a crown of thorns, and put it about his [head],"
Mark,15,18,"And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah]!"
Mark,15,19,"And they struck him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing [their] knees worshipped him."
Mark,15,20,"And when they had deceived him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him."
Mark,15,21,"And they compel one Shim’on [he has heard] a Cyrenian [supremacy of the bridle] , who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander [one who assists men] and Rufus [red] , to bear his stake (cross)."
Mark,15,22,"And they bring him unto the place Gulgolta [place of the skull] , which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull."
Mark,15,23,And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received [it] not.
Mark,15,24,"And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take."
Mark,15,25,"And it was the third hour, and they crucified him."
Mark,15,26,"And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Mark,15,27,"And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left."
Mark,15,28,"And the scripture was fulfilled, which says, And he was numbered with the transgressors."
Mark,15,29,"And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, you i that destroy the temple, and build [it] in three days,"
Mark,15,30,"Save yourself, and come down from the stake (cross)."
Mark,15,31,"Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the Torah-teachers (Scribes) , He saved others; himself he cannot save."
Mark,15,32,"Let Moshiach [Messiah] the King of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] descend now from the stake (cross) , that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him."
Mark,15,33,"And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour."
Mark,15,34,"And at the ninth hour Yeshua [God is Salvation] cried with a loud voice, saying, Elohi! Elohi! L’mah sh’vaktani? which is, being interpreted, My God-Theos, my God-Theos, why have you i forsaken me?"
Mark,15,35,"And some of them that stood by, when they heard [it] , said, Behold, he calls Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah]."
Mark,15,36,"And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put [it] on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] will come to take him down."
Mark,15,37,"And Yeshua [God is Salvation] cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost."
Mark,15,38,And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.
Mark,15,39,"And when the Centurion (Roman commander of an hundred men) , which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God-Theos."
Mark,15,40,"There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Miryam [waters of strength] Magdala [a tower] , and Miryam [waters of strength] the mother of Ya’akov [heal-grabber] the less and of Yosi [may God multiply] , and Salome;"
Mark,15,41,"(Who also, when he was in Galil [circuit, district] , followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Mark,15,42,"And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the Shabbat [rest],"
Mark,15,43,"Yosef [God will add] of Ramatayim [heights] , an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God-Theos, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate [armed with a spear] , and craved the body of Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
Mark,15,44,"And Pilate [armed with a spear] marvelled if he were already dead: and calling [unto him] the Centurion (Roman commander of an hundred men) , he asked him whether he had been any while dead."
Mark,15,45,"And when he knew [it] of the Centurion (Roman commander of an hundred men) , he gave the body to Yosef [God will add]."
Mark,15,46,"And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was cut out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre."
Mark,15,47,And Miryam [waters of strength] Magdala [a tower] and Miryam [waters of strength] [the mother] of Yosi [may God multiply] beheld where he was laid.
Mark,16,1,"And when the Shabbat [rest] was past, Miryam [waters of strength] Magdala [a tower] , and Miryam [waters of strength] the [mother] of Ya’akov [heal-grabber] , and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him."
Mark,16,2,"And very early in the morning the first [day] of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun."
Mark,16,3,"And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?"
Mark,16,4,"And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great."
Mark,16,5,"And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted."
Mark,16,6,"And he says unto them, Be not affrighted: You 2f seek Yeshua [God is Salvation] of Natzeret [one separated] , which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him."
Mark,16,7,"But go your way, tell his disciples and Kefa [pebble] that he goes before you into Galil [circuit, district] : there shall you 2f see him, as he said unto you."
Mark,16,8,"And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any [man] ; for they were afraid."
Mark,16,9,"Now when [Yeshua [God is Salvation] ] was risen early the first [day] of the week, he appeared first to Miryam [waters of strength] Magdala [a tower] , out of whom he had cast seven demons."
Mark,16,10," [And] she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept."
Mark,16,11,"And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not."
Mark,16,12,"After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country."
Mark,16,13,"And they went and told [it] unto the residue (part that remains, the rest) : neither believed they them."
Mark,16,14,"Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and blindness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen."
Mark,16,15,"And he said unto them, Go you 2f into all the world, and preach the Gospel (joyful message) to every creature."
Mark,16,16,He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not shall be judged.
Mark,16,17,And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues (foreign languages);
Mark,16,18,"They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."
Mark,16,19,"So then after the Lord - Kurios had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God-Theos."
Mark,16,20,"And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord - Kurios working with [them] , and confirming the word with signs following. Amen."
