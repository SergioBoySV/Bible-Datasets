Jude,1,1,"Y’hudah [Praised] , the slave of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , and brother of Ya’akov [heal-grabber] , to them that are sanctified by God-The Father the Father, and preserved in Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah], [and] called:"

Jude,1,3,"Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort [you] that you 2f should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints."
Jude,1,4,"For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God-The Father into lasciviousness (being lustful, loose or lewd; promoting lustful desires in others) , and denying the only Lord - Kurios God-The Father, and our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah]."
Jude,1,5,"I will therefore put you in remembrance, though you 2f once knew this, how that the Lord - Kurios, having saved the people out of the land of Mitzrayim (Egypt) [the black land, The Narrow Place] , afterward destroyed them that believed not."
Jude,1,6,"And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day."
Jude,1,7,"Even as S’dom [Burning] and ‘Amorah [a ruined heap] , and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire."
Jude,1,8,"Likewise also these [filthy] dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities."
Jude,1,9,"Yet Mikha’el [Who is Like God?] the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , dared (was bold enough) not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord - Kurios rebuke (reprimand; strongly warn; restrain) you i."
Jude,1,10,"But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves."
Jude,1,11,"Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Kayin [something produced, spear] , and ran greedily after the error of Bil’am [Not of the People] for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core."
Jude,1,12,"These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds [they are] without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withers, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;"
Jude,1,13,"Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever."
Jude,1,14,"And Hanokh (trained and vowed, dedicated; profound (go deep into something)) also, the seventh from Adam (Man, ground; red; earthling), prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord - Kurios comes with ten thousands of his saints,"
Jude,1,15,"To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard [speeches] which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
Jude,1,16,"These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaks great swelling [words] , having men’s persons in admiration because of advantage."
Jude,1,17,"But, beloved, remember you 2f the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah];"
Jude,1,18,"How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts."
Jude,1,19,"These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit [Ruach]."
Jude,1,20,"But you 2f , beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh],"
Jude,1,21,"Keep yourselves in the love of God-The Father, looking for the mercy of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] unto eternal life."
Jude,1,22,"And of some have compassion, making a difference:"
Jude,1,23,"And others save with fear, pulling [them] out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh."
Jude,1,24,"Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present [you] faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,"
Jude,1,25,"To the only wise God-The Father our Saviour, [be] glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen."
