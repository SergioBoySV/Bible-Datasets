Hebrews,1,1,"God-The Father, who at sundry times and in different manners spoke in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,"
Hebrews,1,2,"Has in these last days spoken unto us by [his] Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;"
Hebrews,1,3,"Who being the brightness of [his] glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;"
Hebrews,1,4,"Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they."
Hebrews,1,5,"For unto which of the angels said he at any time, you i are my Son, this day have I begotten you i ? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?"
Hebrews,1,6,"And again, when he brings in the firstbegotten into the world, he says, And let all the angels of God-The Father worship him."
Hebrews,1,7,"And of the angels he says, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire."
Hebrews,1,8,"But unto the Son [he says] , You 1s throne, O God-The Father, [is] forever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness [is] the sceptre of your i kingdom."
Hebrews,1,9,"you i have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God-The Father, [even] your i God-The Father, has anointed you i with the oil of gladness above your i fellows."
Hebrews,1,10,"And, you i , Lord - Kurios, in the beginning have laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of your i hands:"
Hebrews,1,11,They shall perish; but you i remaine; and they all shall grow (become; advance) old as does a garment;
Hebrews,1,12,"And as a vesture shall you i fold them up, and they shall be changed: but you i are the same, and your i years shall not fail."
Hebrews,1,13,"But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make your i enemies your i footstool?"
Hebrews,1,14,"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?"
Hebrews,2,1,"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let [them] slip."
Hebrews,2,2,"For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence (punishment for evil, reward) of reward;"
Hebrews,2,3,"How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord - Kurios, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard [him];"
Hebrews,2,4,"God-The Father also bearing [them] witness, both with signs and wonders, and with different miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] , according to his own will?"
Hebrews,2,5,"For unto the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak."
Hebrews,2,6,"But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that you i are mindful of him? or the Son of Man, that you i visit him?"
Hebrews,2,7,"you i made him a little lower than the angels; you i crowned him with glory and honour, and did set him over the works of your i hands:"
Hebrews,2,8,"you i have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing [that is] not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him."
Hebrews,2,9,"But we see Yeshua [God is Salvation] , who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God-The Father should taste death for every man."
Hebrews,2,10,"For it became him (was fitting for; was exactly suited for) , for whom [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
Hebrews,2,11,"For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified [are] all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,"
Hebrews,2,12,"Saying, I will declare your i name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto you i."
Hebrews,2,13,"And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God-The Father has given me."
Hebrews,2,14,"Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;"
Hebrews,2,15,And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
Hebrews,2,16,For truly he took not on [him the nature of] angels; but he took on [him] the seed of Avraham [Exalted Father].
Hebrews,2,17,"For what reason in all things it behoved him to be made like unto [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things [pertaining] to God-The Father, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people."
Hebrews,2,18,"For in that he himself has suffered being tried or tested, he is able to help (aid) them that are tried or tested."
Hebrews,3,1,"For what reason, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Moshiach [Messiah] Yeshua [God is Salvation];"
Hebrews,3,2,"Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] [was faithful] in all his house."
Hebrews,3,3,"For this [man] was counted worthy of more glory than Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honour than the house."
Hebrews,3,4,For every house is built by some [man] ; but he that built all things [is] God-The Father.
Hebrews,3,5,"And Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] truly [was] faithful in all his house, as a slave, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;"
Hebrews,3,6,"But Moshiach [Messiah] as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end."
Hebrews,3,7,"For what reason (as the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] says, To day if you 2f will hear his voice,"
Hebrews,3,8,"Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:"
Hebrews,3,9,"When your fathers tried or tested me, proved me, and saw my works forty years."
Hebrews,3,10,"For what reason I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always err in [their] heart; and they have not known my ways."
Hebrews,3,11,"So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)"
Hebrews,3,12,"Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God-The Father."
Hebrews,3,13,"But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin."
Hebrews,3,14,"For we are made partakers of Moshiach [Messiah] , if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;"
Hebrews,3,15,"While it is said, To day if you 2f will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation."
Hebrews,3,16,"For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Mitzrayim (Egypt) [the black land, The Narrow Place] by Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters]."
Hebrews,3,17,"But with whom was he grieved forty years? [was it] not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?"
Hebrews,3,18,"And to whom swore he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?"
Hebrews,3,19,So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
Hebrews,4,1,"Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left [us] of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it."
Hebrews,4,2,"For unto us was the Gospel (joyful message) preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard [it]."
Hebrews,4,3,"For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world."
Hebrews,4,4,"For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh [day] on this wise, And God-The Father did rest the seventh day from all his works."
Hebrews,4,5,"And in this [place] again, If they shall enter into my rest."
Hebrews,4,6,"Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter in it, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:"
Hebrews,4,7,"Again, he limits a certain day, saying in David [Beloved] , To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if you 2f will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."
Hebrews,4,8,"For if Yehoshua [God is Salvation] had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day."
Hebrews,4,9,There remains therefore a keeping of a Sabbath to the people of God-The Father.
Hebrews,4,10,"For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God-The Father [did] from his."
Hebrews,4,11,"Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief."
Hebrews,4,12,"For the word of God-The Father [is] quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the expounding (dissecting) asunder of soul and Spirit [Ruach] , and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."
Hebrews,4,13,Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things [are] naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
Hebrews,4,14,"Seeing then that we have a great High Priest, that is passed into the heavens, Yeshua [God is Salvation] the Son of God-The Father, let us hold fast [our] profession."
Hebrews,4,15,"For we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tried or tested like as [we are, yet] without sin."
Hebrews,4,16,"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."
Hebrews,5,1,"For every High Priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things [pertaining] to God-The Father, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:"
Hebrews,5,2,"Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity."
Hebrews,5,3,"And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins."
Hebrews,5,4,"And no man takes this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God-The Father, as [was] Aharon [Bright, Very High]."
Hebrews,5,5,"So also Moshiach [Messiah] glorified not himself to be made an High Priest; but he that said unto him, you i are my Son, to day have I begotten you i."
Hebrews,5,6,"As he says also in another [place] , you i [are] a priest forever after the order of Malki-Tzedek [king of righteousness]."
Hebrews,5,7,"Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;"
Hebrews,5,8,"Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;"
Hebrews,5,9,"And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;"
Hebrews,5,10,Called of God-The Father an High Priest after the order of Malki-Tzedek [king of righteousness].
Hebrews,5,11,"Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing you 2f are dull of hearing."
Hebrews,5,12,"For when for the time you 2f ought to be teachers, you 2f have need that one teach you again which [be] the first principles of the oracles of God-The Father; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat."
Hebrews,5,13,For every one that uses milk [is] unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
Hebrews,5,14,"But strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, [even] those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."
Hebrews,6,1,"Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Moshiach [Messiah] , let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God-The Father,"
Hebrews,6,2,"Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment."
Hebrews,6,3,"And this will we do, if God-The Father permit."
Hebrews,6,4,"For [it is] impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh],"
Hebrews,6,5,"And have tasted the good word of God-The Father, and the powers of the world to come,"
Hebrews,6,6,"If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God-The Father afresh, and put [him] to an open shame."
Hebrews,6,7,"For the earth which drink in the rain that comes oft upon it, and brings forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receives blessing from God-The Father:"
Hebrews,6,8,"But that which bears thorns and briers [is] rejected, and [is] near unto cursing; whose end [is] to be burned."
Hebrews,6,9,"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak."
Hebrews,6,10,"For God-The Father [is] not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which you 2f have showed toward his name, in that you 2f have ministered to the saints, and do minister."
Hebrews,6,11,And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:
Hebrews,6,12,"That you 2f be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
Hebrews,6,13,"For when God-The Father made promise to Avraham [Exalted Father] , because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,"
Hebrews,6,14,"Saying, Surely blessing I will bless you i , and multiplying I will multiply you i."
Hebrews,6,15,"And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise."
Hebrews,6,16,For men truly swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation [is] to them an end of all strife.
Hebrews,6,17,"Wherein God-The Father, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it] by an oath:"
Hebrews,6,18,"That by two Immutable (Unchangeable) things, in which [it was] impossible for God-The Father to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:"
Hebrews,6,19,"Which [hope] we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which enters into that within the veil;"
Hebrews,6,20,"Where the forerunner is for us entered, [even] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , made an High Priest forever after the order of Malki-Tzedek [king of righteousness]."
Hebrews,7,1,"For this Malki-Tzedek [king of righteousness] , king of Salem, priest of the most high God-The Father, who met Avraham [Exalted Father] returning from the slaughter of the kings, and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) him;"
Hebrews,7,2,"To whom also Avraham [Exalted Father] gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;"
Hebrews,7,3,"Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God-The Father; abides a priest continually."
Hebrews,7,4,"Now consider how great this man [was] , unto whom even the patriarch Avraham [Exalted Father] gave the tenth of the spoils."
Hebrews,7,5,"And truly they that are of the sons of Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] , who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the waist of Avraham [Exalted Father]:"
Hebrews,7,6,"But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Avraham [Exalted Father] , and Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) him that had the promises."
Hebrews,7,7,And without all contradiction the less is Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) of the better.
Hebrews,7,8,"And here men that die receive tithes; but there he [receives them] , of whom it is witnessed that he lives."
Hebrews,7,9,"And as I may so say, Levi (Levite) [Adhesion, Joiner] also, who receives tithes, payed tithes in Avraham [Exalted Father]."
Hebrews,7,10,"For he was yet in the waist of his father, when Malki-Tzedek [king of righteousness] met him."
Hebrews,7,11,"If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Malki-Tzedek [king of righteousness] , and not be called after the order of Aharon [Bright, Very High]?"
Hebrews,7,12,"For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law."
Hebrews,7,13,"For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar."
Hebrews,7,14,For [it is] evident that our Lord - Kurios sprang out of Y’hudah [praised] ; of which tribe Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] spoke nothing concerning priesthood.
Hebrews,7,15,"And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Malki-Tzedek [king of righteousness] there arises another priest,"
Hebrews,7,16,"Who is made, not after the law of a carnal (of the flesh, sensual) commandment, but after the power of an endless life."
Hebrews,7,17,"For he testifies, you i [are] a priest forever after the order of Malki-Tzedek [king of righteousness]."
Hebrews,7,18,For there is truly a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
Hebrews,7,19,"For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did] ; by the which we draw near unto God-The Father."
Hebrews,7,20,And inasmuch as not without an oath [he was made priest]:
Hebrews,7,21,"(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord - Kurios swore and will not repent, you i [are] a priest forever after the order of Malki-Tzedek [king of righteousness])"
Hebrews,7,22,"By so much was Yeshua [God is Salvation] made a surety of a better testament (a covenant, ratified in death)."
Hebrews,7,23,"And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:"
Hebrews,7,24,"But this [man] , because he continues ever, has an unchangeable priesthood."
Hebrews,7,25,"For what reason he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God-The Father by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them."
Hebrews,7,26,"For such an High Priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;"
Hebrews,7,27,"Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself."
Hebrews,7,28,"For the law makes men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, [makes] the Son, who is consecrated forevermore."
Hebrews,8,1,"Now of the things which we have spoken [this is] the sum: We have such an High Priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;"
Hebrews,8,2,"A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord - Kurios pitched, and not man."
Hebrews,8,3,For every High Priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore [it is] of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
Hebrews,8,4,"For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:"
Hebrews,8,5,"Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] was admonished of God-The Father when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, says he, [that] you i make all things according to the pattern showed to you i in the mount."
Hebrews,8,6,"But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises."
Hebrews,8,7,"For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second."
Hebrews,8,8,"For finding fault to them, he says, Behold, the days come, says the Lord - Kurios, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] and with the house of Y’hudah [Praise] [Let Him (God) Be Praised]:"
Hebrews,8,9,"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Mitzrayim (Egypt) [the black land, The Narrow Place] ; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, says the Lord - Kurios."
Hebrews,8,10,"For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Yisra’el [He Holds Onto The Heal Of God] after those days, says the Lord - Kurios; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God-The Father, and they shall be to me a people:"
Hebrews,8,11,"And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord - Kurios: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest."
Hebrews,8,12,"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more."
Hebrews,8,13,"In that he says, A new [covenant] , he has made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old [is] ready to vanish away."
Hebrews,9,1,"Then truly the first [covenant] had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary."
Hebrews,9,2,"For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein [was] the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the sanctuary."
Hebrews,9,3,"And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;"
Hebrews,9,4,"Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein [was] the golden pot that had manna, and Aharon [Bright, Very High] ’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;"
Hebrews,9,5,And over it the k’vurim (cherubim) of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.
Hebrews,9,6,"Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service [of God-The Father]."
Hebrews,9,7,"But into the second [went] the High Priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and [for] the errors of the people:"
Hebrews,9,8,"The Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:"
Hebrews,9,9,"Which [was] a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;"
Hebrews,9,10," [Which stood] only in meats and drinks, and different washings, and carnal (of the flesh, sensual) ordinances, imposed [on them] until the time of reformation."
Hebrews,9,11,"But Moshiach [Messiah] being come an High Priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;"
Hebrews,9,12,"Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption [for us]."
Hebrews,9,13,"For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:"
Hebrews,9,14,"How much more shall the blood of Moshiach [Messiah] , who through the eternal Spirit [Ruach] offered himself without spot to God-The Father, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God-The Father?"
Hebrews,9,15,"And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament (a covenant, ratified in death) , that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions [that were] under the first testament (a covenant, ratified in death) , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance."
Hebrews,9,16,"For where a testament (a covenant, ratified in death) [is] , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator."
Hebrews,9,17,"For a testament (a covenant, ratified in death) [is] of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator lives."
Hebrews,9,18,"Whereupon neither the first [testament (a covenant, ratified in death)] was dedicated without blood."
Hebrews,9,19,"For when Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,"
Hebrews,9,20,"Saying, This [is] the blood of the testament (a covenant, ratified in death) which God-The Father has enjoined unto you."
Hebrews,9,21,"Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry."
Hebrews,9,22,And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no forgiveness (pardon).
Hebrews,9,23, [It was] therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
Hebrews,9,24,"For Moshiach [Messiah] is not entered into the holy places made with hands, [which are] the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God-The Father for us:"
Hebrews,9,25,"Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the High Priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;"
Hebrews,9,26,For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
Hebrews,9,27,"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:"
Hebrews,9,28,So Moshiach [Messiah] was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them without sin that look for him shall he appear the second time unto salvation..
Hebrews,10,1,"For the law having a shadow of good things to come, [and] not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect."
Hebrews,10,2,For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.
Hebrews,10,3,But in those [sacrifices there is] a remembrance again [made] of sins every year.
Hebrews,10,4,For [it is] not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
Hebrews,10,5,"For what reason when he comes into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering you i would not, but a body have you i prepared me:"
Hebrews,10,6,In burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin you i have had no pleasure.
Hebrews,10,7,"Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do you i will, O God-The Father."
Hebrews,10,8,"Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and [offering] for sin you i would not, neither had pleasure [in it] ; which are offered by the law;"
Hebrews,10,9,"Then said he, Lo, I come to do you i will, O God-The Father. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second."
Hebrews,10,10,By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] once [for all].
Hebrews,10,11,"And every priest stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:"
Hebrews,10,12,"But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God-The Father;"
Hebrews,10,13,From from this time forth (from now on) expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.
Hebrews,10,14,For by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified.
Hebrews,10,15," [Whereof] the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,"
Hebrews,10,16,"This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord - Kurios, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;"
Hebrews,10,17,And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
Hebrews,10,18,"Now where forgiveness (pardon) of these [is, there is] no more offering for sin."
Hebrews,10,19,"Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Yeshua [God is Salvation],"
Hebrews,10,20,"By a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;"
Hebrews,10,21,And [having] an High Priest over the house of God-The Father;
Hebrews,10,22,"Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water."
Hebrews,10,23,Let us hold fast the profession of [our] faith without wavering; (for he [is] faithful that promised;)
Hebrews,10,24,And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:
Hebrews,10,25,"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some [is] ; but exhorting [one another] : and so much the more, as you 2f see the day approaching."
Hebrews,10,26,"For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,"
Hebrews,10,27,"But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."
Hebrews,10,28,He that despised Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] ’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
Hebrews,10,29,"Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you 2f , shall he be thought worthy, who has trampled under foot the Son of God-The Father, and has counted the blood of the covenant, which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite (contempt; angy hatred) unto the Spirit [Ruach] of grace?"
Hebrews,10,30,"For we know him that has said, Vengeance [belongs] unto me, I will recompense, says the Lord - Kurios. And again, The Lord - Kurios shall judge his people."
Hebrews,10,31, [It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God-The Father.
Hebrews,10,32,"But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you 2f were illuminated, you 2f endured a great fight of afflictions;"
Hebrews,10,33,"Partly, whilst you 2f were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst you 2f became companions of them that were so used."
Hebrews,10,34,"For you 2f had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you 2f have in heaven a better and an enduring substance."
Hebrews,10,35,"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompence (punishment for evil, reward) of reward."
Hebrews,10,36,"For you 2f have need of patience, that, after you 2f have done the will of God-The Father, you 2f might receive the promise."
Hebrews,10,37,"For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not wait."
Hebrews,10,38,"Now the just shall live by faith: but if [any man] draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him."
Hebrews,10,39,But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
Hebrews,11,1,"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
Hebrews,11,2,For by it the elders obtained a good report.
Hebrews,11,3,"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God-The Father, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."
Hebrews,11,4,"By faith Hevel (heardsman) offered unto God-The Father a more excellent sacrifice than Kayin [something produced, spear] , by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God-The Father testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks."
Hebrews,11,5,"By faith Hanokh (trained and vowed, dedicated; profound (go deep into something)) was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God-The Father had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God-The Father."
Hebrews,11,6,"But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him] : for he that comes to God-The Father must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."
Hebrews,11,7,"By faith No’ah [Motion] , being warned of God-The Father of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith."
Hebrews,11,8,"By faith Avraham [Exalted Father] , when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing to which he went."

Hebrews,11,10,"For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker [is] God-The Father."
Hebrews,11,11,"Through faith also Sarah [princess] herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised."
Hebrews,11,12,"Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, [so many] as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable."
Hebrews,11,13,"These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them] , and embraced [them] , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth."
Hebrews,11,14,For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
Hebrews,11,15,"And truly, if they had been mindful of that [country] from what place they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned."
Hebrews,11,16,"But now they desire a better [country] , that is, an heavenly: wherefore God-The Father is not ashamed to be called their God-The Father: for he has prepared for them a city."
Hebrews,11,17,"By faith Avraham [Exalted Father] , when he was tried, offered up Yitz’khak [Laughter] : and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten [son],"
Hebrews,11,18,"Of whom it was said, That in Yitz’khak [Laughter] shall your i seed be called:"
Hebrews,11,19,"Accounting that God-The Father [was] able to raise [him] up, even from the dead; from what place also he received him in a figure."
Hebrews,11,20,By faith Yitz’khak [Laughter] Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] [Heal of God] and ‘Esav [Hairy] concerning things to come.
Hebrews,11,21,"By faith Ya’akov [He who grabs onto the heal of] [Heal of God] , when he was a dying, Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) both the sons of Yosef [God will add] ; and worshipped, [leaning] upon the top of his staff."

Hebrews,11,23,"By faith Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw [he was] a proper (one’s own; peculiar; particular) child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment."
Hebrews,11,24,"By faith Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] , when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Par’oh’s [Pharaoh - Great House] daughter;"
Hebrews,11,25,"Choosing rather to suffer (allow, to let, permit) affliction with the people of God-The Father, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;"
Hebrews,11,26,"Esteeming the reproach (disgrace; shame) of Moshiach [Messiah] greater riches than the treasures in Mitzrayim (Egypt) [the black land, The Narrow Place] : for he had respect unto the recompence (punishment for evil, reward) of the reward."
Hebrews,11,27,"By faith he forsook Mitzrayim (Egypt) [the black land, The Narrow Place] , not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible."

Hebrews,11,32,"And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gid’on [the cutter down] , and [of] Barak [Lightning] , and [of] Shimshon [Like the Sun] , and [of] Yiftach [whom God sets free]; [of] David [Beloved] also, and Sh’mu’el [His name is El] , and [of] the prophets:"
Hebrews,11,33,"Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,"
Hebrews,11,34,"Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens."
Hebrews,11,35,"Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:"
Hebrews,11,36,"And others had trial of [cruel] mockings and scourgings, yes, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:"
Hebrews,11,37,"They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tried or tested, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;"
Hebrews,11,38,"(Of whom the world was not worthy) they wandered in deserts, and [in] mountains, and [in] dens and caves of the earth."
Hebrews,11,39,"And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:"
Hebrews,11,40,"God-The Father having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."
Hebrews,12,1,"For what reason seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset [us] , and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,"
Hebrews,12,2,"Looking unto Yeshua [God is Salvation] the author and finisher of [our] faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the stake (cross) , despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God-The Father."

Hebrews,12,4,"You 2f have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin."
Hebrews,12,5,"And you 2f have forgotten the Exhortation (encouragement; counsel) which speaks unto you as unto children, My son, despise not you i the chastening of the Lord - Kurios, nor give up when you i are rebuked of him:"
Hebrews,12,6,"For whom the Lord - Kurios loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives."
Hebrews,12,7,"If you 2f endure chastening, God-The Father deals with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chastens not?"
Hebrews,12,8,"But if you 2f be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are you 2f bastards, and not sons."
Hebrews,12,9,"Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected [us] , and we gave [them] reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?"
Hebrews,12,10,"For they truly for a few days chastened [us] after their own pleasure; but he for [our] profit, that [we] might be partakers of his holiness."
Hebrews,12,11,"Now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby."

Hebrews,12,17,"For you 2f know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears."
Hebrews,12,18,"For you 2f are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,"
Hebrews,12,19,"And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which [voice] they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:"
Hebrews,12,20,"(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:"

Hebrews,12,25,"See that you 2f refuse not him that speaks. For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke on earth, much more [shall not] we [escape] , if we turn away from him that [speaks] from heaven:"
Hebrews,12,26,"Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven."

Hebrews,13,10,"We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle."
Hebrews,13,11,"For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the High Priest for sin, are burned without the camp."
Hebrews,13,12,"For what reason Yeshua [God is Salvation] also, that he might sanctify (make holy; set apart for God’s use) the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate."
