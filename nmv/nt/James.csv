James,1,1,"Ya’akov [heal-grabber] , a slave of God-The Father and of the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting."
James,1,2,"My brethren, count it all joy when you 2f fall into different temptations;"
James,1,3,"Knowing [this] , that the trying of your faith works patience."
James,1,4,"But let patience have [her] perfect work, that you 2f may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing."
James,1,5,"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God-The Father, that gives to all [men] liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."
James,1,6,"But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed."
James,1,7,For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord - Kurios.
James,1,8,A double minded man [is] unstable in all his ways.
James,1,9,Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
James,1,10,"But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away."
James,1,11,"For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withers the grass, and the flower thereof falls, and the grace of the fashion of it perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways."
James,1,12,"Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) [is] the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord - Kurios has promised to them that love him."
James,1,13,"Let no man say when he is tried or tested, I am tried or tested of God-The Father: for God-The Father cannot be tried or tested with evil, neither tempts he any man:"
James,1,14,"But every man is tried or tested, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed."
James,1,15,"Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death."
James,1,16,"Do not err, my beloved brethren."
James,1,17,"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."
James,1,18,"Of his own will begat (to be father of; be ancestor of) he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures."
James,1,19,"For what reason, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:"
James,1,20,For the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God-The Father.
James,1,21,"For what reason lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls."
James,1,22,"But be you 2f doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves."
James,1,23,"For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror:"
James,1,24,"For he beholds himself, and goes his way, and immediately forgets what manner of man he was."
James,1,25,"But whoso looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues [in it] , he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be Blessed (Favored by God; happy; prosperous) in his deed."
James,1,26,"If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man’s religion [is] vain."
James,1,27,"Pure religion and undefiled before God-The Father and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, [and] to keep himself unspotted from the world."
James,2,1,"My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah], [the Lord - Kurios] of glory, with respect of persons."
James,2,2,"For if there come unto your Synagogue a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile clothing;"
James,2,3,"And you 2f have respect to him that wears the expensive (costly) clothing, and say unto him, Sit you i here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand you i there, or sit here under my footstool:"
James,2,4,"Are you 2f not then partial in yourselves, and are become of evil thoughts?"
James,2,5,"Listen, my beloved brethren, Has not God-The Father chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?"
James,2,6,"But you 2f have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?"
James,2,7,Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which you 2f are called?
James,2,8,"If you 2f fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, you i shall love your i neighbour as yourself, you 2f do well:"
James,2,9,"But if you 2f have respect to persons, you 2f commit sin, and are convicted of the law as transgressors."
James,2,10,"For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend (make angry; make one stumble; violate) in one [point] , he is guilty of all."
James,2,11,"For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if you i commit no adultery, yet if you i kill, you i are become a transgressor of the law."
James,2,12,"So speak you 2f , and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty."
James,2,13,"For he shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy; and mercy rejoices against judgment."
James,2,14,"What [does it] profit, my brethren, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?"
James,2,15,"If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,"
James,2,16,"And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be [you 2f ] warmed and filled; notwithstanding you 2f give them not those things which are needful to the body; what [does it] profit?"
James,2,17,"Even so faith, if it has not works, is dead, being alone."
James,2,18,"Yes, a man may say, you i have faith, and I have works: show me your i faith without your i works, and I will show you i my faith by my works."
James,2,19,"you i believe that there is one God-The Father; you i do well: the demons also believe, and tremble."
James,2,20,"But will you i know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?"
James,2,21,"Was not Avraham [Exalted Father] our father justified by works, when he had offered Yitz’khak [Laughter] his son upon the altar?"
James,2,22,"See you i how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?"
James,2,23,"And the scripture was fulfilled which says, Avraham [Exalted Father] believed God-The Father, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God-The Father."
James,2,24,"You 2f see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only."
James,2,25,"Likewise also was not Rachav [Pride] [Wide] the prostitute justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent [them] out another way?"
James,2,26,"For as the body without the Spirit [Ruach] is dead, so faith without works is dead also."
James,3,1,"My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation."
James,3,2,"For in many things we offend (make angry; make one stumble; violate) all. If any man offend (make angry; make one stumble; violate) not in word, the same [is] a perfect man, [and] able also to bridle the whole body."
James,3,3,"Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body."
James,3,4,"Behold also the ships, which though [they be] so great, and [are] driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm (rudder and tiller to steer a ship) , to wherever the governor lists."
James,3,5,"Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindles!"
James,3,6,"And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell."
James,3,7,"For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed of mankind:"
James,3,8,"But the tongue can no man tame; [it is] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison."
James,3,9,"Therewith bless we God-The Father, even the Father; and with that curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God-The Father."
James,3,10,"Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be."
James,3,11,Does a fountain send forth at the same place sweet [water] and bitter?
James,3,12,"Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so [can] no fountain both yield salt water and fresh."
James,3,13,Who [is] a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good Conversation (behavior; way of life; community) his works with meekness of wisdom.
James,3,14,"But if you 2f have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth."
James,3,15,"This wisdom descendeth not from above, but [is] earthly, sensual, devilish."
James,3,16,"For where envying and strife [is] , there [is] confusion and every evil work."
James,3,17,"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, [and] easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy."
James,3,18,And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
James,4,1,"From from what place [come] wars and fightings among you? [come they] not hence, [even] of your lusts that war in your members?"
James,4,2,"You 2f lust, and have not: you 2f kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: you 2f fight and war, yet you 2f have not, because you 2f ask not."
James,4,3,"You 2f ask, and receive not, because you 2f ask amiss, that you 2f may consume [it] upon your lusts."
James,4,4,"You 2f adulterers and adulteresses, know you 2f not that the friendship of the world is hatred (being an enemy) with God-The Father? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God-The Father."
James,4,5,"Do you 2f think that the scripture says in vain, The Spirit [Ruach] that dwells in us lusts to envy?"
James,4,6,"But he gives more grace. For what reason he says, God-The Father resists the proud, but gives grace unto the humble."
James,4,7,"Submit yourselves therefore to God-The Father. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
James,4,8,"Draw near to God-The Father, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse [your] hands, [you 2f ] sinners; and purify [your] hearts, [you 2f ] double minded."
James,4,9,"Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and [your] joy to heaviness."
James,4,10,"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord - Kurios, and he shall lift you up."
James,4,11,"Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaks evil of [his] brother, and his brother, speaks evil of the law, and the law: but if you i judge the law, you i are not a doer of the law, but a judge."
James,4,12,"There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who are you i that judge another?"
James,4,13,"Go to now, you 2f that say, To day or tomorrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:"
James,4,14,"Whereas you 2f know not what [shall be] on the morrow. For what [is] your life? It is even a vapour, that appears for a little time, and then vanisheth away."
James,4,15,"For that you 2f [ought] to say, If the Lord - Kurios will, we shall live, and do this, or that."
James,4,16,But now you 2f rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
James,4,17,"Therefore to him that knows to do good, and does [it] not, to him it is sin."
James,5,1,"Go to now, [you 2f ] rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon [you]."
James,5,2,"Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten."
James,5,3,"Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. You 2f have heaped treasure together for the last days."
James,5,4,"Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, cries: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord - Kurios of Tzva’ot [Lord - Kurios of the Armies of Israel]."
James,5,5,"You 2f ave lived in pleasure on the earth, and been reckless; you 2f have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter."
James,5,6,You 2f have condemned [and] killed the just; [and] he does not resist you.
James,5,7,"Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord - Kurios. Behold, the farmer (or rancher) waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain."
James,5,8,Be you 2f also patient; establish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord - Kurios draws near.
James,5,9,"Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest you 2f be condemned: behold, the judge stands before the door."
James,5,10,"Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord - Kurios, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience."
James,5,11,"Behold, we count them happy which endure. You 2f have heard of the patience of Iyov [hated] , and have seen the end of the Lord - Kurios; that the Lord - Kurios is very pitiful, and of tender mercy."
James,5,12,"But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and [your] No, No; lest you 2f fall into hypocrisy."
James,5,13,Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.
James,5,14,"Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord - Kurios:"
James,5,15,"And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord - Kurios shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."
James,5,16,"Confess [your] faults one to another, and pray one for another, that you 2f may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much."
James,5,17,"Eliyahu [my God is Yehovah] was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months."
James,5,18,"And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit."
James,5,19,"Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;"
James,5,20,"Let him know, that he which converts the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins."
