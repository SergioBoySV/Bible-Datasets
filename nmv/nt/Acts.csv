Acts,8,21,you i have neither part nor lot in this matter: for your i heart is not right in the sight of God-The Father.
Acts,8,22,"Repent therefore of this your i wickedness, and pray God-The Father, if perhaps the thought of your i heart may be forgiven you i."
Acts,8,23,"For I perceive that you i are in the gall (something bitter or poisonous) of bitterness, and [in] the bond of iniquity."

Acts,8,32,"The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:"
Acts,8,33,In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.
Acts,8,34,"And the eunuch answered Philip [friend of horses] , and said, I pray you i , of whom speaks the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?"

Acts,12,14,"And when she knew Kefa [pebble] ’s voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Kefa [pebble] stood before the gate."
Acts,12,15,"And they said unto her, you i are mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel."
Acts,12,16,"But Kefa [pebble] continued knocking: and when they had opened [the door] , and saw him, they were astonished."
Acts,12,17,"But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord - Kurios had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go show these things unto Ya’akov [heal-grabber] , and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place."

Acts,15,19,"For what reason my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Goyim [Gentiles] are turned to God-The Father:"
Acts,15,20,"But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and [from] fornication, and [from] things strangled, and [from] blood."
Acts,15,21,"For Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] of old time has in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every Shabbat [rest] day."
Acts,15,22,"Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch [speedy as a chariot] with Sha’ul [desired] and Bar-Nabba [son of rest]; [namely] , Y’hudah [praised] surnamed Bar-Sabba [Son of consolation or son of Exhortation (encouragement; counsel)] , and Silas [woody] , chief men among the brethren:"
Acts,15,23,And they wrote [letters] by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren [send] greeting unto the brethren which are of the Goyim [Gentiles] in Antioch [speedy as a chariot] and Aram [exalted] (Syria [etymology is uncertain] ) and Cilicia [the land which rolls]:
Acts,15,24,"Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, [You 2f must] be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no [such] commandment:"
Acts,15,25,"It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Bar-Nabba [son of rest] and Sha’ul [desired],"
Acts,15,26,Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah].
Acts,15,27,"We have sent therefore Y’hudah [praised] and Silas [woody] , who shall also tell [you] the same things by mouth."
Acts,15,28,"For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] , and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;"
Acts,15,29,"That you 2f abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if you 2f keep yourselves, you 2f shall do well. Fare you 2f well."
Acts,15,30,"So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch [speedy as a chariot] : and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the Epistle (important or formal letter):"
Acts,15,31," [Which] when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation."
Acts,15,32,"And Y’hudah [praised] and Silas [woody] , being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed [them]."
Acts,15,33,"And after they had tarried [there] a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles."
Acts,15,34,Yet it pleased Silas [woody] to abide there still.
Acts,15,35,"Sha’ul [desired] also and Bar-Nabba [son of rest] continued in Antioch [speedy as a chariot] , teaching and preaching the word of the Lord - Kurios, with many others also."
Acts,15,36,"And some days after Sha’ul [desired] said unto Bar-Nabba [son of rest] , Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord - Kurios, [and see] how they do."
Acts,15,37,"And Bar-Nabba [son of rest] determined to take with them Yochanan [Yehovah has graced] , whose surname was Mark [a defense]."
Acts,15,38,"But Sha’ul [desired] thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia [of every tribe] , and went not with them to the work."
Acts,15,39,"And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Bar-Nabba [son of rest] took Mark [a defense] , and sailed unto Cyprus [love: a blossom];"
Acts,15,40,"And Sha’ul [desired] chose Silas [woody] , and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God-The Father."
Acts,15,41,"And he went through Aram [exalted] (Syria [etymology is uncertain] ) and Cilicia [the land which rolls] , confirming the churches."
Acts,16,1,"Then came he to Derbe [tanner of skin] and Lystra [ransoming] : and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy [honoring God] , the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewish person, and believed; but his father [was] a Greek [unstable: the miry one]:"
Acts,16,2,Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra [ransoming] and Iconium [little image].
Acts,16,3,Him would Sha’ul [desired] have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek [unstable: the miry one].
Acts,16,4,"And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Acts,16,5,"And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily."
Acts,16,6,"Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia [dry, barren] and the region of Galatia [land of the Galli, Gauls, A Celt] , and were forbidden of the Holy Spirit [Ruach HaKodesh] to preach the word in Asia [orient],"
Acts,16,7,"After they were come to Mysia [land of beach trees] , they assayed (attempted; tested; analyzed) to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit [Ruach] suffered them not."
Acts,16,8,And they passing by Mysia [land of beach trees] came down to Troas (Trojan) [penetrated].
Acts,16,9,"And a vision appeared to Sha’ul [desired] in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia [extended land] , and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia [extended land] , and help us."
Acts,16,10,"And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia [extended land] , assuredly gathering that the Lord - Kurios had called us for to preach the Gospel (joyful message) unto them."
Acts,16,11,"Therefore loosing from Troas (Trojan) [penetrated] , we came with a straight course to Samothracia [a sign of rags] , and the next [day] to Neapolis [new city];"
Acts,16,12,"And from there to Philippi [lover of horses] , which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia [extended land], [and] a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days."
Acts,16,13,"And on the Shabbat [rest] we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont (used to; in the habit of) to be made; and we sat down, and spoke unto the women which resorted [there]."
Acts,16,14,"And a certain woman named Lydia [travail] , a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira [odour of affliction] , which worshipped God-The Father, heard [us] : whose heart the Lord - Kurios opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Sha’ul [desired]."
Acts,16,15,"And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought [us] , saying, If you 2f have judged me to be faithful to the Lord - Kurios, come into my house, and abide [there] . And she constrained us."
Acts,16,16,"And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain girl possessed with a Spirit [Ruach] of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:"
Acts,16,17,"The same followed Sha’ul [desired] and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God-The Father, which show unto us the way of salvation."
Acts,16,18,"And this did she many days. But Sha’ul [desired] , being grieved, turned and said to the Spirit [Ruach] , I command you i in the name of Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] to come out of her. And he came out the same hour."
Acts,16,19,"And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Sha’ul [desired] and Silas [woody] , and drew [them] into the marketplace unto the rulers,"
Acts,16,20,"And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , do exceedingly trouble our city,"
Acts,16,21,"And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans [strength]."
Acts,16,22,"And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat [them]."
Acts,16,23,"And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast [them] into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:"
Acts,16,24,"Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks."
Acts,16,25,"And at midnight Sha’ul [desired] and Silas [woody] prayed, and sang praises unto God-The Father: and the prisoners heard them."
Acts,16,26,"And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed."
Acts,16,27,"And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled."
Acts,16,28,"But Sha’ul [desired] cried with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm: for we are all here."
Acts,16,29,"Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Sha’ul [desired] and Silas [woody],"
Acts,16,30,"And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
Acts,16,31,"And they said, Believe on the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] Moshiach [Messiah] , and you i shall be saved, and your i house."
Acts,16,32,"And they spoke unto him the word of the Lord - Kurios, and to all that were in his house."
Acts,16,33,"And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed [their] stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately."
Acts,16,34,"And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God-The Father with all his house."
Acts,16,35,"And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go."
Acts,16,36,"And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Sha’ul [desired] , The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace."
Acts,16,37,"But Sha’ul [desired] said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans [strength] , and have cast [us] into prison; and now do they thrust us out privately? No truly; but let them come themselves and fetch us out."
Acts,16,38,"And the sergeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans [strength]."
Acts,16,39,"And they came and besought them, and brought [them] out, and desired [them] to depart out of the city."
Acts,16,40,"And they went out of the prison, and entered into [the house of] Lydia [travail] : and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed."
Acts,17,1,"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica [victory of falsity] , where was a synagogue of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah]:"
Acts,17,2,"And Sha’ul [desired] , as his manner was, went in unto them, and three Shabbat [rest] days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,"
Acts,17,3,"Opening and alleging, that Moshiach [Messiah] must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Yeshua [God is Salvation] , whom I preach unto you, is Moshiach [Messiah]."
Acts,17,4,"And some of them believed, and consorted with Sha’ul [desired] and Silas [woody] ; and of the devout Greeks [unstable: miry ones] a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few."
Acts,17,5,"But the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason [one who will heal] , and sought to bring them out to the people."
Acts,17,6,"And when they found them not, they drew Jason [one who will heal] and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come here also;"
Acts,17,7,"Whom Jason [one who will heal] has received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar [venerable] , saying that there is another king, [one] Yeshua [God is Salvation]."
Acts,17,8,"And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things."
Acts,17,9,"And when they had taken security of Jason [one who will heal] , and of the other, they let them go."
Acts,17,10,And the brethren immediately sent away Sha’ul [desired] and Silas [woody] by night unto Berea [well watered] : who coming [there] went into the synagogue of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah].
Acts,17,11,"These were more noble than those in Thessalonica [victory of falsity] , in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."
Acts,17,12,"Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks [unstable: miry ones], and of men, not a few."
Acts,17,13,"But when the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] of Thessalonica [victory of falsity] had knowledge that the word of God-The Father was preached of Sha’ul [desired] at Berea [well watered] , they came there also, and stirred up the people."
Acts,17,14,And then immediately the brethren sent away Sha’ul [desired] to go as it were to the sea: but Silas [woody] and Timothy [honoring God] abode there still.
Acts,17,15,"And they that conducted Sha’ul [desired] brought him unto Athens [uncertainty] : and receiving a commandment unto Silas [woody] and Timothy [honoring God] for to come to him with all speed, they departed."
Acts,17,16,"Now while Sha’ul [desired] waited for them at Athens [uncertainty] , his Spirit [Ruach] was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry."
Acts,17,17,"Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him."
Acts,17,18,"Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans [a helper: defender], and of the Stoicks [of the portico] , encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seems to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Yeshua [God is Salvation] , and the resurrection."
Acts,17,19,"And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus [martial peak (high council)] , saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof you i speak, [is]?"
Acts,17,20,For you i brings certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.
Acts,17,21,"(For all the Athenians [uncertainty] and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)"
Acts,17,22,"Then Sha’ul [desired] stood in the midst of Mars’ [etymology uncertain] hill, and said, [You 2f ] men of Athens [uncertainty] , I perceive that in all things you 2f are too superstitious."
Acts,17,23,"For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you 2f ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you."
Acts,17,24,"God-The Father that made the world and all things in it, seeing that he is Lord - Kurios of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;"
Acts,17,25,"Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he gives to all life, and breath, and all things;"
Acts,17,26,"And has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;"
Acts,17,27,"That they should seek the Lord - Kurios, if perhaps (maybe) they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:"
Acts,17,28,"For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring."
Acts,17,29,"Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God-The Father, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by are and man’s device."
Acts,17,30,And the times of this ignorance God-The Father winked at; but now commands all men every where to repent:
Acts,17,31,"Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by [that] man whom he has ordained; [whereof] he has given assurance unto all [men] , in that he has raised him from the dead."
Acts,17,32,"And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some deceived: and others said, We will hear you i again of this [matter]."
Acts,17,33,So Sha’ul [desired] departed from among them.
Acts,17,34,"However certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which [was] Dionysius [devoted to shouting (Bacchus)] the Areopagite [a judge of the High Council] , and a woman named Damaris [a heifer] , and others with them."
Acts,18,1,"After these things Sha’ul [desired] departed from Athens [uncertainty] , and came to Corinth [satiated];"
Acts,18,2,"And found a certain Jewish person named Aquila [an eagle] , born in Pontus [the sea] , lately come from Italy [calf-like] , with his wife Priscilla [ancient] ; (because that Claudius [lame] had commanded all Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] to depart from Rome [strength] ) and came unto them."
Acts,18,3,"And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers."
Acts,18,4,"And he reasoned in the synagogue every Shabbat [rest] , and persuaded the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] and the Greeks [unstable: miry ones]."
Acts,18,5,"And when Silas [woody] and Timothy [honoring God] were come from Macedonia [extended land] , Sha’ul [desired] was pressed in the Spirit [Ruach] , and testified to the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] [that] Yeshua [God is Salvation] [was] Moshiach [Messiah]."
Acts,18,6,"And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook [his] clothing, and said unto them, Your blood [be] upon your own heads; I [am] clean: from from this time forth (from now on) I will go unto the Goyim [Gentiles]."
Acts,18,7,"And he departed there, and entered into a certain [man’s] house, named Justus [just], [one] that worshipped God-The Father, whose house bordered (was adjacent to) to the synagogue."
Acts,18,8,"And Crispus [curled] , the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord - Kurios with all his house; and many of the Corinthians [satiated] hearing believed, and were baptized."
Acts,18,9,"Then spoke the Lord - Kurios to Sha’ul [desired] in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your i peace:"
Acts,18,10,"For I am with you i , and no man shall set on you i to hurt you i : for I have much people in this city."
Acts,18,11,"And he continued [there] a year and six months, teaching the word of God-The Father among them."
Acts,18,12,"And when Gallio [one who lives on milk] was the deputy of Achaia [trouble] , the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] made insurrection with one accord against Sha’ul [desired] , and brought him to the judgment seat,"
Acts,18,13,"Saying, This [fellow] persuades men to worship God-The Father contrary to the law."
Acts,18,14,"And when Sha’ul [desired] was now about to open [his] mouth, Gallio [one who lives on milk] said unto the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O [you 2f ] Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , reason would that I should bear with you:"
Acts,18,15,"But if it be a question of words and names, and [of] your law, look you 2f [to it] ; for I will be no judge of such [matters]."
Acts,18,16,And he drove them from the judgment seat.
Acts,18,17,"Then all the Greeks [unstable: miry ones] took Sosthenes [saviour of his nation] , the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat [him] before the judgment seat. And Gallio [one who lives on milk] cared for none of those things."
Acts,18,18,"And Sha’ul [desired] [after this] tarried [there] yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed there into Aram [exalted] (Syria [etymology is uncertain]) [exalted] , and with him Priscilla [ancient] and Aquila [an eagle] ; having shorn [his] head in Cenchrea [millet] : for he had a vow."
Acts,18,19,"And he came to Ephesus [permitted] , and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah]."
Acts,18,20,"When they desired [him] to wait longer time with them, he consented not;"
Acts,18,21,"But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : but I will return again unto you, if God-The Father will. And he sailed from Ephesus [permitted]."
Acts,18,22,"And when he had landed at Caesarea [severed] , and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch [speedy as a chariot]."
Acts,18,23,"And after he had spent some time [there] , he departed, and went over [all] the country of Galatia [land of the Galli, Gauls, A Celt] and Phrygia [dry, barren] in order, strengthening all the disciples."
Acts,18,24,"And a certain Jewish man named Apollos [given by Apollo (etymology uncertain)] , born at Alexandria [one who assists men] , an eloquent man, [and] mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus [permitted]."

Acts,18,27,"And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia [trouble] , the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:"

Acts,19,11,And God-The Father wrought special miracles by the hands of Sha’ul [desired]:
Acts,19,12,"So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them."
Acts,19,13,"Then certain of the vagabond Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord - Kurios [he to whom a person belongs] Yeshua [God is Salvation] , saying, We adjure you by Yeshua [God is Salvation] whom Sha’ul [desired] preaches."

Acts,19,21,"After these things were ended, Sha’ul [desired] purposed in the Spirit [Ruach] , when he had passed through Macedonia [extended land] and Achaia [trouble] , to go to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome [strength]."
Acts,19,22,"So he sent into Macedonia [extended land] two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy [honoring God] and Erastus [beloved] ; but he himself detained (held) in Asia [orient] for a season."
Acts,19,23,And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.
Acts,19,24,"For a certain [man] named Demetrius [belonging to Ceres - goddess of agriculture (etymology uncertain)] , a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana [complete light] , brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;"

Acts,19,27,"So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nothing (despised) ; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana [complete light] should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia [orient] and the world worships."
Acts,19,28,"And when they heard [these sayings] , they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great [is] Diana [complete light] of the Ephesians [permitted]."
Acts,19,29,"And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius [lord] and Aristarchus [the best ruler] , men of Macedonia [extended land] , Sha’ul [desired] ’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre."
Acts,19,30,"And when Sha’ul [desired] would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not."

Acts,19,36,"Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, you 2f ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly."
Acts,19,37,"For you 2f have brought here these men, which are neither robbers of temples, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess."
Acts,19,38,"For what reason if Demetrius [belonging to Ceres - goddess of agriculture (etymology uncertain)] , and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another."
Acts,19,39,"But if you 2f enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly."
Acts,19,40,"For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse."
Acts,19,41,"And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly."

Acts,23,4,"And they that stood by said, Revile you i God-The Father’s High Priest?"
Acts,23,5,"Then said Sha’ul [desired] , I did not know not, brethren, that he was the High Priest: for it is written, you i shall not speak evil of the ruler of your i people."
Acts,23,6,"But when Sha’ul [desired] perceived that the one part were Tz’dukim (Sadducees) [followers of the right] , and the other P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist]s) [separatists] , he cried out in the council, Men [and] brethren, I am a Pharisee [separatist] , the son of a Pharisee [separatist] : of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question."
Acts,23,7,"And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] and the Tz’dukim (Sadducees) [followers of the right] : and the multitude was divided."
Acts,23,8,"For the Tz’dukim (Sadducees) [followers of the right] say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor Spirit [Ruach] : but the P’rushim (Pharisees) [separatists] confess both."
Acts,23,9,"And there arose a great cry: and the Torah-teachers (Scribes) [that were] of the P’rushim (Pharisee [separatist] s) [separatists] ’ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a Spirit [Ruach] or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God-The Father."
Acts,23,10,"And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Sha’ul [desired] should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring [him] into the castle."
Acts,23,11,"And the night following the Lord - Kurios stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Sha’ul [desired] : for as you i have testified of me in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , so must you i bear witness also at Rome [strength]."
Acts,23,12,"And when it was day, certain of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Sha’ul [desired]."
Acts,23,13,And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
Acts,23,14,"And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Sha’ul [desired]."
Acts,23,15,"Now therefore you 2f with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you tomorrow, as though you 2f would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him."
Acts,23,16,"And when Sha’ul [desired] ’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Sha’ul [desired]."
Acts,23,17,"Then Sha’ul [desired] called one of the centurions unto [him] , and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he has a certain thing to tell him."
Acts,23,18,"So he took him, and brought [him] to the chief captain, and said, Sha’ul [desired] the prisoner called me unto [him] , and prayed me to bring this young man unto you i , who has something to say unto you i."
Acts,23,19,"Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went [with him] aside privately, and asked [him] , What is that you i have to tell me?"
Acts,23,20,"And he said, The Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] have agreed to desire you i that you i would bring down Sha’ul [desired] tomorrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly."
Acts,23,21,"But do not you i yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from you i."
Acts,23,22,"So the chief captain [then] let the young man depart, and charged [him, See you i ] tell no man that you i have showed these things to me."
Acts,23,23,"And he called unto [him] two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea [severed] , and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;"
Acts,23,24,"And provide [them] beasts, that they may set Sha’ul [desired] on, and bring [him] safe unto Felix [happy] the governor."
Acts,23,25,And he wrote a letter after this manner:
Acts,23,26,Claudius [lame] Lysias [releaser] unto the most excellent governor Felix [happy] [send] greeting.
Acts,23,27,"This man was taken of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman [strength]."
Acts,23,28,"And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:"
Acts,23,29,"Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds."
Acts,23,30,"And when it was told me how that the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] laid wait for the man, I sent immediately to you i , and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before you i what [they had] against him. Farewell."
Acts,23,31,"Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Sha’ul [desired] , and brought [him] by night to Antipatris [for forefather]."
Acts,23,32,"On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:"
Acts,23,33,"Who, when they came to Caesarea [severed] , and delivered the Epistle (important or formal letter) to the governor, presented Sha’ul [desired] also before him."
Acts,23,34,"And when the governor had read [the letter] , he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that [he was] of Cilicia [the land which rolls];"
Acts,23,35,"I will hear you i , said he, when your i accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod [heroic] ’s judgment hall."
Acts,24,1,"And after five days Ananias [whom Yehovah has graciously given] the High Priest descended with the elders, and [with] a certain orator [named] Tertullus [triple-hardened] , who informed the governor against Sha’ul [desired]."
Acts,24,2,"And when he was called forth, Tertullus [triple-hardened] began to accuse [him] , saying, Seeing that by you i we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by your i providence,"
Acts,24,3,"We accept [it] always, and in all places, most noble Felix [happy] , with all thankfulness."
Acts,24,4,"Yet, that I be not further tedious unto you i , I pray you i that you i would hear us of your i clemency a few words."
Acts,24,5,"For we have found this man [a] pestilent [fellow] , and a mover of sedition among all the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:"
Acts,24,6,"Who also has gone about to Profane (treat as common; defile) the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law."
Acts,24,7,"But the chief captain Lysias [releaser] came [upon us] , and with great violence took [him] away out of our hands,"
Acts,24,8,"Commanding his accusers to come unto you i : by examining of whom yourself may take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him."
Acts,24,9,"And the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] also assented, saying that these things were so."
Acts,24,10,"Then Sha’ul [desired] , after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that you i have been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:"
Acts,24,11,"Because that you i may understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] for to worship."
Acts,24,12,"And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:"
Acts,24,13,Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.
Acts,24,14,"But this I confess unto you i , that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God-The Father of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:"
Acts,24,15,"And have hope toward God-The Father, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."
Acts,24,16,"And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God-The Father, and [toward] men."
Acts,24,17,"Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings."
Acts,24,18,"Whereupon certain Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] from Asia [orient] found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult."
Acts,24,19,"Who ought to have been here before you i , and object, if they had ought against me."
Acts,24,20,"Or else let these same [here] say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,"
Acts,24,21,"Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day."
Acts,24,22,"And when Felix [happy] heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of [that] way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias [releaser] the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter."
Acts,24,23,"And he commanded a Centurion (Roman commander of an hundred men) to keep Sha’ul [desired] , and to let [him] have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him."
Acts,24,24,"And after certain days, when Felix [happy] came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewish person, he sent for Sha’ul [desired] , and heard him concerning the faith in Moshiach [Messiah]."
Acts,24,25,"And as he reasoned of righteousness, self-control, and judgment to come, Felix [happy] trembled, and answered, Go your i way for this time; when I have a convenient (fit; appropriate; proper (one’s own; peculiar; particular)) season, I will call for you i."
Acts,24,26,"He hoped also that money should have been given him of Sha’ul [desired] , that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him."
Acts,24,27,"But after two years Porcius Festus [swinish festival] came into Felix [happy] ’ room: and Felix [happy] , willing to show the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] a pleasure, left Sha’ul [desired] bound."
Acts,25,1,"Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea [severed] to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace]."
Acts,25,2,"Then the High Priest and the chief of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] informed him against Sha’ul [desired] , and besought him,"
Acts,25,3,"And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , laying wait in the way to kill him."
Acts,25,4,"But Festus answered, that Sha’ul [desired] should be kept at Caesarea [severed] , and that he himself would depart shortly [there]."
Acts,25,5,"Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with [me] , and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him."
Acts,25,6,"And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea [severed] ; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Sha’ul [desired] to be brought."
Acts,25,7,"And when he was come, the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] which came down from Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Sha’ul [desired] , which they could not prove."
Acts,25,8,"While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] , neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar [venerable] , have I offended any thing at all."
Acts,25,9,"But Festus, willing to do the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] a pleasure, answered Sha’ul [desired] , and said, Will you i go up to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and there be judged of these things before me?"
Acts,25,10,"Then said Sha’ul [desired] , I stand at Caesar [venerable] ’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] have I done no wrong, as you i very well know."
Acts,25,11,"For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar [venerable]."
Acts,25,12,"Then Festus [festival] , when he had conferred with the council, answered, Have you i appealed unto Caesar [venerable] ? unto Caesar [venerable] shall you i go."
Acts,25,13,And after certain days king Agrippa [Hero like] and Bernice [bring victory] came unto Caesarea [severed] to salute Festus [festival].
Acts,25,14,"And when they had been there many days, Festus [festival] declared Sha’ul [desired] ’s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix [happy]:"
Acts,25,15,"About whom, when I was at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , the chief priests and the elders of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] informed [me] , desiring [to have] judgment against him."
Acts,25,16,"To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans [strength] to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have license to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him."
Acts,25,17,"Therefore, when they were come here, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth."
Acts,25,18,"Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:"
Acts,25,19,"But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Yeshua [God is Salvation] , which was dead, whom Sha’ul [desired] affirmed to be alive."
Acts,25,20,"And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked [him] whether he would go to Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and there be judged of these matters."
Acts,25,21,"But when Sha’ul [desired] had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar [venerable]."
Acts,25,22,"Then Agrippa [Hero like] said unto Festus [festival] , I would also hear the man myself. Tomorrow, said he, you i shall hear him."
Acts,25,23,"And on the morrow, when Agrippa [Hero like] was come, and Bernice [bring victory] , with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus [festival] ’ commandment Sha’ul [desired] was brought forth."
Acts,25,24,"And Festus [festival] said, King Agrippa [Hero like] , and all men which are here present with us, you 2f see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] have dealt with me, both at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and [also] here, crying that he ought not to live any longer."
Acts,25,25,"But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him."
Acts,25,26,"Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. For what reason I have brought him forth before you, and specially before you i , O king Agrippa [Hero like] , that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write."
Acts,25,27,"For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes [laid] against him."
Acts,26,1,"Then Agrippa [Hero like] said unto Sha’ul [desired] , you i are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Sha’ul [desired] stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:"
Acts,26,2,"I think myself happy, king Agrippa [Hero like] , because I shall answer for myself this day before you i touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah]:"
Acts,26,3,Especially [because I know] you i to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] : wherefore I beseech (to call upon; appeal; beg) you i to hear me patiently.
Acts,26,4,"My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , know all the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah];"
Acts,26,5,"Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee [separatist]."
Acts,26,6,And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God-The Father unto our fathers:
Acts,26,7,"Unto which [promise] our twelve tribes, instantly serving [God-The Father] day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa [Hero like] , I am accused of the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah]."
Acts,26,8,"Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God-The Father should raise the dead?"
Acts,26,9,"I truly thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Yeshua [God is Salvation] of Natzeret [one separated]."
Acts,26,10,"Which thing I also did in Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] : and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against [them]."
Acts,26,11,"And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled [them] to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted [them] even unto strange cities."
Acts,26,12,"Whereupon as I went to Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] with authority and commission from the chief priests,"
Acts,26,13,"At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me."
Acts,26,14,"And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the ‘Evri’ot [Hebrew] tongue, Sha’ul [desired] , Sha’ul [desired] , why persecute you i me? [it is] hard for you i to kick against the pricks."
Acts,26,15,"And I said, Who are you i , Lord - Kurios? And he said, I am Yeshua [God is Salvation] whom you i persecute."
Acts,26,16,"But rise, and stand upon your i feet: for I have appeared unto you i for this purpose, to make you i a minister and a witness both of these things which you i have seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto you i;"
Acts,26,17,"Delivering you i from the people, and [from] the Goyim [Gentiles] , unto whom now I send you i,"
Acts,26,18,"To open their eyes, [and] to turn [them] from darkness to light, and [from] the power of Satan [the adversary] unto God-The Father, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me."
Acts,26,19,"Whereupon, O king Agrippa [Hero like] , I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:"
Acts,26,20,"But showed first unto them of Dammesek (Damascus) [silent is the sackcloth weaver] , and at Yerushalayim [Foundation of Peace] , and throughout all the coasts of Y’hudah [praised] , and [then] to the Goyim [Gentiles] , that they should repent and turn to God-The Father, and do works meet for repentance."
Acts,26,21,"For these causes the Y’hudim (Judeans) [praised of Yah] caught me in the temple, and went about to kill [me]."
Acts,26,22,"Having therefore obtained help of God-The Father, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moshe [He Who Draws Out Of The Waters] did say should come:"
Acts,26,23,"That Moshiach [Messiah] should suffer (allow, to let, permit), [and] that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should show light unto the people, and to the Goyim [Gentiles]."
Acts,26,24,"And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus [festival] said with a loud voice, Sha’ul [desired] , you i are beside yourself; much learning does make you i mad."
Acts,26,25,"But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus [festival] ; but speak forth the words of tand soberness."
Acts,26,26,"For the king knows of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner."
Acts,26,27,"King Agrippa [Hero like] , believe you i the prophets? I know that you i believe."
Acts,26,28,"Then Agrippa [Hero like] said unto Sha’ul [desired] , Almost you i persuade me to be a Christian [Messianic - Follower of Messiah]."
Acts,26,29,"And Sha’ul [desired] said, I would to God-The Father, that not only you i , but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds."
Acts,26,30,"And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice [bring victory] , and they that sat with them:"
Acts,26,31,"And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds."
Acts,26,32,"Then said Agrippa [Hero like] unto Festus [festival] , This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar [venerable]."
Acts,27,1,"And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy [calf-like] , they delivered Sha’ul [desired] and certain other prisoners unto [one] named Julius [soft-haired] , a Centurion (Roman commander of an hundred men) of Augustus’ band."
Acts,27,2,"And entering into a ship of Adramyttium [I shall abide in death] , we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia [orient]; [one] Aristarchus [the best ruler] , a Macedonian [burning] of Thessalonica [victory of falsity] , being with us."
Acts,27,3,"And the next [day] we touched at Tzidon [hunting] . And Julius [soft-haired] courteously entreated Sha’ul [desired] , and gave [him] liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself."
Acts,27,4,"And when we had launched from there, we sailed under Cyprus [love: a blossom] , because the winds were contrary."
Acts,27,5,"And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia [the land which rolls] and Pamphylia [of every tribe] , we came to Myra, [a city] of Lycia [wolfish]."
Acts,27,6,And there the Centurion (Roman commander of an hundred men) found a ship of Alexandria [one who assists men] sailing into Italy [calf-like] ; and he put us in it.
Acts,27,7,"And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus [netted] , the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete [fleshy] , over against Salmone [clothed];"
Acts,27,8,"And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The Fair Havens; near whereunto was the city [of] Lasea [shaggy]."
Acts,27,9,"Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Sha’ul [desired] admonished [them],"
Acts,27,10,"And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives."
Acts,27,11,"Nevertheless the Centurion (Roman commander of an hundred men) believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Sha’ul [desired]."
Acts,27,12,"And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart there also, if by any means they might attain to Phoenicia [land of palm trees], [and there] to winter; [which is] an haven of Crete [fleshy] , and lies toward the south west and north west."
Acts,27,13,"And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained [their] purpose, loosing [there] , they sailed close by Crete [fleshy]."
Acts,27,14,"But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon (furious, northeasterly wind) [a violent agitation]."
Acts,27,15,"And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let [her] drive."
Acts,27,16,"And running under a certain island which is called Clauda [lame] , we had much work to come by the boat:"
Acts,27,17,"Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, struck sail, and so were driven."
Acts,27,18,"And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next [day] they lightened the ship;"
Acts,27,19,And the third [day] we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.
Acts,27,20,"And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on [us] , all hope that we should be saved was then taken away."
Acts,27,21,"But after long abstinence Sha’ul [desired] stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, you 2f should have listened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete [fleshy] , and to have gained this harm and loss."
Acts,27,22,"And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of [any man’s] life among you, but of the ship."
Acts,27,23,"For there stood by me this night the angel of God-The Father, whose I am, and whom I serve,"
Acts,27,24,"Saying, Fear not, Sha’ul [desired] ; you i must be brought before Caesar [venerable] : and, lo, God-The Father has given you i all them that sail with you i."
Acts,27,25,"For what reason, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God-The Father, that it shall be even as it was told me."
Acts,27,26,However we must be cast upon a certain island.
Acts,27,27,"But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria (Adriatic) [without wood] , about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;"
Acts,27,28,"And sounded, and found [it] twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found [it] fifteen fathoms."
Acts,27,29,"Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day."
Acts,27,30,"And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,"
Acts,27,31,"Sha’ul [desired] said to the Centurion (Roman commander of an hundred men) and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, you 2f cannot be saved."
Acts,27,32,"Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off."
Acts,27,33,"And while the day was coming on, Sha’ul [desired] besought [them] all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that you 2f have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing."
Acts,27,34,For what reason I pray you to take [some] meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.
Acts,27,35,"And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God-The Father in presence of them all: and when he had broken [it] , he began to eat."
Acts,27,36,"Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took [some] meat."
Acts,27,37,And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
Acts,27,38,"And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea."
Acts,27,39,"And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship."
Acts,27,40,"And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed [themselves] unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore."
Acts,27,41,"And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves."
Acts,27,42,"And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape."
Acts,27,43,"But the Centurion (Roman commander of an hundred men) , willing to save Sha’ul [desired] , kept them from [their] purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast [themselves] first [into the sea] , and get to land:"
Acts,27,44,"And the rest, some on boards, and some on [broken pieces] of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land."
Acts,28,1,"And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita (Malta) [honey]."
Acts,28,2,"And the barbarous (foreign) people showed us exceptional kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold."
Acts,28,3,"And when Sha’ul [desired] had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid [them] on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand."
