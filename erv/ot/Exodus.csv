Exodus,1,1,"When Jacob (Israel) went to Egypt, his sons and their families went with him. Here are the names of those sons"
Exodus,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah"
Exodus,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin"
Exodus,1,4,"Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher."
Exodus,1,5,"Another son, Joseph, was already in Egypt. So Jacob’s whole family was with him in Egypt—70 descendants in all."
Exodus,1,6,"Later, Joseph, his brothers, and all the people of that generation died."
Exodus,1,7,"But the Israelites had many children, and their number grew until the country of Egypt was filled with them."
Exodus,1,8,Then a new king began to rule Egypt. He did not know Joseph.
Exodus,1,9,"This king said to his people, “Look at the Israelites. There are too many of them, and they are stronger than we are!"
Exodus,1,10,"We must make plans to stop them from growing stronger. If there is a war, they might join our enemies, defeat us, and escape from the land!”"
Exodus,1,11,"The Egyptians decided to make life hard for the Israelites, so they put slave masters over the people. These masters forced the Israelites to build the cities of Pithom and Rameses for the king. The king used these cities to store grain and other things."
Exodus,1,12,"The Egyptians forced the Israelites to work harder and harder. But the harder they worked, the more they grew and spread, and the more the Egyptians became afraid of them."
Exodus,1,13,So the Egyptians made them work even harder.
Exodus,1,14,They made life hard for the Israelites. They forced the Israelites to work hard at making bricks and mortar and to work hard in the fields. The Egyptians showed no mercy in all the hard work they made the Israelites do!
Exodus,1,15,There were two Hebrew nurses who helped the Israelite women give birth. They were named Shiphrah and Puah. The king of Egypt said to the nurses
Exodus,1,16,"“You will continue to help the Hebrew women give birth to their children. If a girl baby is born, let the baby live. But if the baby is a boy, you must kill him!”"
Exodus,1,17,"But the nurses trusted God, so they did not obey the king’s command. They let all the baby boys live."
Exodus,1,18,"The king of Egypt called for the nurses and asked them, “Why did you do this? Why did you let the baby boys live?”"
Exodus,1,19,"The nurses said to the king, “The Hebrew women are much stronger than the Egyptian women. They give birth to their babies before we can go to help them.”"
Exodus,1,20,"The nurses trusted God, so he was good to them and allowed them to have their own families.
The Hebrews continued to have more children, and they became very strong."
Exodus,1,21,"The nurses trusted God, so he was good to them and allowed them to have their own families.
The Hebrews continued to have more children, and they became very strong."
Exodus,1,22,"So Pharaoh gave this command to his own people: “If the Hebrew women give birth to a baby girl, let it live. But if they have a baby boy, you must throw it into the Nile River.”"
Exodus,2,1,There was a man from the family of Levi who decided to marry a woman from the tribe of Levi.
Exodus,2,2,She became pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy. The mother saw how beautiful the baby was and hid him for three months.
Exodus,2,3,She hid him for as long as she could. After three months she made a basket and covered it with tar so that it would float. Then she put the baby in the basket and put the basket in the river in the tall grass.
Exodus,2,4,The baby’s sister stayed and watched to see what would happen to the baby.
Exodus,2,5,"Just then, Pharaoh’s daughter went to the river to bathe. She saw the basket in the tall grass. Her servants were walking beside the river, so she told one of them to go get the basket."
Exodus,2,6,The king’s daughter opened the basket and saw a baby boy. The baby was crying and she felt sorry for him. Then she noticed that it was one of the Hebrew babies.
Exodus,2,7,"The baby’s sister was still hiding. She stood and asked the king’s daughter, “Do you want me to go find a Hebrew woman who can nurse the baby and help you care for it?”"
Exodus,2,8,"The king’s daughter said, “Yes, please.”
So the girl went and brought the baby’s own mother."
Exodus,2,9,"The king’s daughter said to the mother, “Take this baby and feed him for me. I’ll pay you to take care of him.”
So the woman took her baby and cared for him."
Exodus,2,10,"The baby grew, and after some time, the woman gave the baby to the king’s daughter. The king’s daughter accepted the baby as her own son. She named him Moses because she had pulled him from the water."
Exodus,2,11,"Moses grew and became a man. He saw that his own people, the Hebrews, were forced to work very hard. One day he saw an Egyptian man beating a Hebrew man."
Exodus,2,12,"Moses looked around and saw that no one was watching, so he killed the Egyptian and buried him in the sand."
Exodus,2,13,"The next day Moses saw two Hebrew men fighting each other. He saw that one man was wrong and said to him, “Why are you hurting your neighbor?”"
Exodus,2,14,"The man answered, “Did anyone say you could be our ruler and judge? Tell me, will you kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?”
Then Moses was afraid. He thought to himself, “Now everyone knows what I did.”"
Exodus,2,15,"Pharaoh heard about what Moses did, so he decided to kill him. But Moses ran away from Pharaoh and went to the land of Midian.
Moses stopped near a well in Midian."
Exodus,2,16,There was a priest there who had seven daughters. These girls came to that well to get water for their father’s sheep. They were trying to fill the water trough with water.
Exodus,2,17,But there were some shepherds there who chased the girls away and would not let them get water. So Moses helped the girls and gave water to their animals.
Exodus,2,18,"Then they went back to their father, Reuel. He asked them, “Why have you come home early today?”"
Exodus,2,19,"The girls answered, “The shepherds chased us away, but an Egyptian rescued us. He got water for us and gave it to our animals.”"
Exodus,2,20,"So Reuel said to his daughters, “Where is this man? Why did you leave him? Go invite him to eat with us.”"
Exodus,2,21,"Moses was happy to stay with that man. Reuel let Moses marry his daughter, Zipporah."
Exodus,2,22,Zipporah became pregnant and had a son. Moses named him Gershom because Moses was a stranger in a land that was not his own.
Exodus,2,23,"A long time passed and that king of Egypt died. But the Israelites were still forced to work very hard. They cried for help, and God heard them."
Exodus,2,24,"God heard their painful cries and remembered the agreement he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
Exodus,2,25,"God saw the troubles of the Israelites, and he knew that he would soon help them."
Exodus,3,1,"Moses’ father-in-law was named Jethro. Jethro was a priest of Midian. Moses took care of Jethro’s sheep. One day Moses led the sheep to the west side of the desert. He went to a mountain called Horeb, the mountain of God."
Exodus,3,2,"On that mountain, Moses saw the angel of the LORD in a burning bush.
Moses saw a bush that was burning without being destroyed."
Exodus,3,3,So he decided to go closer to the bush and see how a bush could continue burning without being burned up.
Exodus,3,4,"The LORD saw Moses was coming to look at the bush. So he called to him from the bush. He said, “Moses, Moses!”
Moses said, “Yes, Lord.”"
Exodus,3,5,"Then God said, “Don’t come any closer. Take off your sandals. You are standing on holy ground."
Exodus,3,6,"I am the God of your ancestors. I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.”
Moses covered his face because he was afraid to look at God."
Exodus,3,7,"Then the LORD said, “I have seen the troubles my people have suffered in Egypt, and I have heard their cries when the Egyptians hurt them. I know about their pain."
Exodus,3,8,"Now I will go down and save my people from the Egyptians. I will take them from that land and lead them to a good land where they can be free from these troubles. It is a land filled with many good things. Many different people live in that land: the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites."
Exodus,3,9,"I have heard the cries of the Israelites, and I have seen the way the Egyptians have made life hard for them."
Exodus,3,10,"So now I am sending you to Pharaoh. Go! Lead my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,3,11,"But Moses said to God, “I am not a great man! How can I be the one to go to Pharaoh and lead the Israelites out of Egypt?”"
Exodus,3,12,"God said, “You can do it because I will be with you. This will be the proof that I am sending you: After you lead the people out of Egypt, you will come and worship me on this mountain.”"
Exodus,3,13,"Then Moses said to God, “But if I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your ancestors sent me,’ then the people will ask, ‘What is his name?’ What should I tell them?”"
Exodus,3,14,"Then God said to Moses, “Tell them, ‘I AM WHO I AM.’ When you go to the Israelites, tell them, ‘I AM’ sent me to you.”"
Exodus,3,15,"And God said, “Tell the Israelites that you were sent by YAHWEH, the God of your ancestors—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob. This will always be my name. It is how I want the people to remember me from now on."
Exodus,3,16,"“Now go and call together the elders of the people. Tell them that YAHWEH, the God of your ancestors—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—appeared to you. Give them this message from me: ‘I have been watching over you and have seen what people in Egypt have done to you."
Exodus,3,17,"And I have decided that I will take you away from the troubles you are suffering in Egypt. I will lead you to the land that now belongs to others—the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. I will lead you to a land filled with many good things.’"
Exodus,3,18,"“The elders will listen to you. And then you and the elders will go to the Pharaoh. You will tell him, ‘YAHWEH is the God of the Hebrews. He came to us and told us to travel three days into the desert. There we must offer sacrifices to YAHWEH our God.’"
Exodus,3,19,“But I know that the Pharaoh will not let you go. Only a great power will force him to let you go
Exodus,3,20,"so I will use my great power against Egypt. I will cause amazing things to happen in that land. After I do this, he will let you go."
Exodus,3,21,And I will cause the Egyptians to be kind to the Israelites. They will give many gifts to your people when they leave Egypt.
Exodus,3,22,"“All the Hebrew women will ask their Egyptian neighbors and the Egyptian women living in their houses for gifts. And those Egyptian women will give them gifts of silver, gold, and fine clothing. Then you will put those gifts on your children. In this way you will take away the wealth of the Egyptians.”"
Exodus,4,1,"Then Moses said to God, “But the Israelites will not believe me when I tell them that you sent me. They will say, ‘The LORD did not appear to you.’”"
Exodus,4,2,"But the LORD said to Moses, “What is that you have in your hand?”
Moses answered, “It is my walking stick.”"
Exodus,4,3,"Then God said, “Throw your walking stick on the ground.”
So Moses threw his walking stick on the ground, and it became a snake. Moses ran from it"
Exodus,4,4,"but the LORD said to him, “Reach out and grab the snake by its tail.”
When Moses reached out and caught the snake’s tail, the snake became a walking stick again."
Exodus,4,5,"Then God said, “Use your stick in this way, and the people will believe that you saw the LORD, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.”"
Exodus,4,6,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “I will give you another proof. Put your hand under your robe.”
So Moses opened his robe and put his hand inside. Then he brought his hand out of the robe and it was changed. His hand was covered with spots that were white like snow."
Exodus,4,7,"Then God said, “Now put your hand into your robe again.” So Moses put his hand into his robe again. Then he brought his hand out, and his hand was changed. Now his hand was good again, as it was before."
Exodus,4,8,"Then God said, “If the people don’t believe you when you use your walking stick, then they will believe you when you show them this sign."
Exodus,4,9,"If they still refuse to believe after you show them both of these signs, then take some water from the Nile River. Pour the water on the ground, and as soon as it touches the ground, it will become blood.”"
Exodus,4,10,"Then Moses said to the LORD, “But, Lord, I am telling you, I am not a good speaker. I have never been able to speak well. And that hasn’t changed since you started talking to me. I am still not a good speaker. You know that I speak slowly and don’t use the best words.”"
Exodus,4,11,"Then the LORD said to him, “Who made a person’s mouth? And who can make someone deaf or not able to speak? Who can make a person blind? Who can make a person able to see? I am the one. I am the said to him, “Who made a person’s mouth? And who can make someone deaf or not able to speak? Who can make a person blind? Who can make a person able to see? I am the one. I am the LORD."
Exodus,4,12,So go. I will be with you when you speak. I will give you the words to say.”
Exodus,4,13,"But Moses said, “My Lord, I beg you to send someone else, not me.”"
Exodus,4,14,"Then the LORD became angry with Moses and said, “All right! I’ll give you someone to help you. Aaron the Levite is your brother, isn’t he? He is a good speaker. In fact, Aaron is already coming to meet you, and he will be happy to see you."
Exodus,4,15,"I will tell you what to say. Then you will tell Aaron, and I will help him say it well. I will tell both of you what to do."
Exodus,4,16,"So Aaron will speak for you. Like God, you will speak to him, and he will tell the people what you say."
Exodus,4,17,So go and carry your walking stick with you. Use it and the other miracles to show the people that I am with you.”
Exodus,4,18,"Then Moses went back to Jethro, his father-in-law. Moses said to him, “Please let me go back to Egypt. I want to see if my people are still alive.”
Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”"
Exodus,4,19,"Then, while Moses was still in Midian, the LORD said to him, “It is safe for you to go back to Egypt now. The men who wanted to kill you are now dead.”"
Exodus,4,20,So Moses put his wife and children on the donkey and returned to Egypt. He carried his walking stick with him—the walking stick with the power of God.
Exodus,4,21,"While Moses was traveling back to Egypt, the LORD spoke to him, “When you talk to Pharaoh remember to show him all the miracles that I have given you the power to do. But I will cause Pharaoh to be very stubborn. He will not let the people go."
Exodus,4,22,"Then you should say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the LORD says: Israel is my firstborn son."
Exodus,4,23,"And I am telling you to let my son go and worship me. If you refuse to let Israel go, then I will kill your firstborn son.’”"
Exodus,4,24,"On the way to Egypt, Moses stopped at a place to spend the night. The LORD met Moses at that place and tried to kill him."
Exodus,4,25,"But Zipporah took a flint knife and circumcised her son. She took the skin and touched his feet. Then she said to Moses, “You are a bridegroom of blood to me.”"
Exodus,4,26,Zipporah said this because she had to circumcise her son. So God let Moses live.
Exodus,4,27,"The LORD had spoken to Aaron and told him, “Go out into the desert and meet Moses.” So Aaron went and met Moses at the Mountain of God. He saw Moses and kissed him."
Exodus,4,28,Moses told Aaron everything the LORD had commanded him to say and all the miracles he must do to prove that God had sent him.
Exodus,4,29,So Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the Israelites.
Exodus,4,30,Then Aaron spoke to the people and told them everything the LORD had told Moses. Then Moses did the miracles for all the people to see
Exodus,4,31,and they believed what they had heard. Then the Israelites understood that the LORD had seen their troubles and had come to help them. So they bowed down and worshiped God.
Exodus,5,1,"After Moses and Aaron talked to the people, they went to Pharaoh and said, “The LORD, the God of Israel, says, ‘Let my people go into the desert so that they can have a festival to honor me.’”"
Exodus,5,2,"But Pharaoh said, “Who is the LORD? Why should I obey him? Why should I let Israel go? I don’t even know who this ? Why should I obey him? Why should I let Israel go? I don’t even know who this LORD is, so I refuse to let Israel go.”"
Exodus,5,3,"Then Aaron and Moses said, “The God of the Hebrews has talked with us. So we beg you to let us travel three days into the desert. There we will offer a sacrifice to the LORD our God. If we don’t do this, he might become angry and destroy us. He might make us die from sickness or war.”"
Exodus,5,4,"But Pharaoh said to them, “Moses and Aaron, you are bothering the workers. Let them do their work. Go back to your own work!"
Exodus,5,5,"There are very many workers, and you are keeping them from doing their jobs.”"
Exodus,5,6,That same day Pharaoh gave a command to the slave masters and Hebrew foremen.
Exodus,5,7,"He said, “You have always given the people straw to use to make bricks. But now, tell them they have to go and find their own straw to make bricks."
Exodus,5,8,But they must still make the same number of bricks as they did before. They have gotten lazy. That is why they are asking me to let them go. They don’t have enough work to do. That is why they asked me to let them make sacrifices to their God.
Exodus,5,9,So make these people work harder. Keep them busy. Then they will not have enough time to listen to the lies of Moses.”
Exodus,5,10,"So the Egyptian slave masters and the Hebrew foremen went to the Israelites and said, “Pharaoh has decided that he will not give you straw for your bricks."
Exodus,5,11,"You must go and get the straw for yourselves. So go and find straw, but you must still make as many bricks as you made before.”"
Exodus,5,12,So the people went everywhere in Egypt looking for straw.
Exodus,5,13,The slave masters forced the people to work even harder. They forced the people to make as many bricks as before.
Exodus,5,14,"The Egyptian slave masters had chosen the Hebrew foremen and had made them responsible for the work the people did. The Egyptian slave masters beat these foremen and said to them, “Why aren’t you making as many bricks as you made in the past? If you could do it then, you can do it now!”"
Exodus,5,15,"Then the Hebrew foremen went to Pharaoh. They complained and said, “We are your servants. Why are you treating us like this?"
Exodus,5,16,"You give us no straw, but you tell us to make as many bricks as before. And now our masters are beating us. Your people are wrong for doing this.”"
Exodus,5,17,"Pharaoh answered, “You are lazy, and you don’t want to work! That is why you ask me to let you go. And that is why you want to leave here and make sacrifices to the LORD."
Exodus,5,18,"Now, go back to work! We will not give you any straw. And you must still make as many bricks as you did before.”"
Exodus,5,19,"The Hebrew foremen knew they were in trouble, because the Pharaoh had told them, “You must still make as many bricks as you made before.”"
Exodus,5,20,"When they were leaving the meeting with Pharaoh, they passed Moses and Aaron. Moses and Aaron were waiting for them."
Exodus,5,21,"So they said to Moses and Aaron, “May the LORD judge and punish you for what you did! You made Pharaoh and his rulers hate us. You have given them an excuse to kill us.”"
Exodus,5,22,"Then Moses prayed to the LORD and said, “Lord, why have you done this terrible thing to your people? Why did you send me here?"
Exodus,5,23,"I went to Pharaoh and said what you told me to say. But since that time he has made the people suffer, and you have done nothing to help them!”"
Exodus,6,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh. I will use my great power against him, and he will let my people go. He will be so ready for them to leave that he will force them to go.”"
Exodus,6,2,"Then God said to Moses, “I am the LORD."
Exodus,6,3,"I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They called me God All-Powerful. They did not know my name, the LORD."
Exodus,6,4,"I made an agreement with them. I promised to give them the land of Canaan. They lived in that land, but it was not their own."
Exodus,6,5,"Now, I have heard their painful cries. I know that they are slaves in Egypt. And I remember my agreement."
Exodus,6,6,"So tell the Israelites that I say to them, ‘I am the LORD. I will save you. You will no longer be slaves of the Egyptians. I will use my great power to make you free, and I will bring terrible punishment to the Egyptians."
Exodus,6,7,"You will be my people and I will be your God. I am the LORD your God, and you will know that I made you free from Egypt."
Exodus,6,8,"I made a great promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I promised to give them a special land. So I will lead you to that land. I will give you that land. It will be yours. I am the LORD.’”"
Exodus,6,9,"So Moses told this to the Israelites, but the people would not listen to him. They were working so hard that they were not patient with Moses."
Exodus,6,10,Then the LORD said to Moses
Exodus,6,11,“Go tell Pharaoh that he must let the Israelites leave his land.”
Exodus,6,12,"But Moses answered, “LORD, the Israelites refuse to listen to me. So surely Pharaoh will also refuse to listen. I am a very bad speaker.”"
Exodus,6,13,"But the LORD talked with Moses and Aaron and commanded them to go and talk to the Israelites and to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. He commanded them to lead the Israelites out of the land of Egypt."
Exodus,6,14,"These are the names of the leaders of the families of Israel:
Israel’s first son, Reuben, had four sons. They were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi."
Exodus,6,15,"Simeon’s sons were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul. (Shaul was the son from a Canaanite woman)."
Exodus,6,16,"Levi lived 137 years. His sons were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
Exodus,6,17,"Gershon had two sons, Libni and Shimei."
Exodus,6,18,"Kohath lived 133 years. His sons were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel."
Exodus,6,19,"Merari’s sons were Mahli and Mushi.
All these families were from Israel’s son Levi."
Exodus,6,20,"Amram lived 137 years. He married his father’s sister, Jochebed. Amram and Jochebed gave birth to Aaron and Moses."
Exodus,6,21,"Izhar’s sons were Korah, Nepheg, and Zicri."
Exodus,6,22,"Uzziel’s sons were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri."
Exodus,6,23,"Aaron married Elisheba. (Elisheba was the daughter of Amminadab, and the sister of Nahshon.) Aaron and Elisheba gave birth to Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
Exodus,6,24,"The sons of Korah (that is, the ancestors of the Korahites) were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph."
Exodus,6,25,"Aaron’s son, Eleazar, married a daughter of Putiel. She gave birth to Phinehas.
All these people were from Israel’s son, Levi."
Exodus,6,26,"Aaron and Moses were from this tribe. And they are the men the LORD spoke to and said, “Lead my people out of Egypt in groups.”"
Exodus,6,27,"Aaron and Moses are the men who talked to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and told him to let the Israelites leave Egypt."
Exodus,6,28,The LORD spoke to Moses again in the land of Egypt.
Exodus,6,29,"He said, “I am the LORD. Tell the king of Egypt everything I tell you.”"
Exodus,6,30,"But Moses, standing there before the LORD, said, “You know me. I’m a very bad speaker. How will I make the king listen to me?”"
Exodus,7,1,"The LORD said to Moses, “See how important I have made you? In speaking to Pharaoh, you will be like God, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet."
Exodus,7,2,You will tell Aaron everything that I command you. Then he will tell the king what I say. And Pharaoh will let the Israelites leave this country.
Exodus,7,3,But I will make Pharaoh stubborn so that he will not do what you tell him. Then I will do many miracles in Egypt to prove who I am.
Exodus,7,4,"But he will still refuse to listen. So then I will punish Egypt very much. And I will lead my army, my people, out of that land."
Exodus,7,5,"I will punish the people of Egypt, and they will learn that I am the LORD. Then I will lead my people out of their country.”"
Exodus,7,6,Moses and Aaron did what the LORD told them.
Exodus,7,7,"Moses was 80 years old at the time, and Aaron was 83."
Exodus,7,8,The LORD said to Moses and Aaron
Exodus,7,9,"“Pharaoh will ask you to prove your power. He will ask you to do a miracle. Tell Aaron to throw his walking stick on the ground. While Pharaoh is watching, the stick will become a snake.”"
Exodus,7,10,"So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and obeyed the LORD. Aaron threw his walking stick down. While Pharaoh and his officers watched, the stick became a snake."
Exodus,7,11,"So Pharaoh called for his wise men and magicians. These men used their magic, and they were able to do the same thing as Aaron."
Exodus,7,12,"They threw their walking sticks on the ground, and their sticks became snakes. But then Aaron’s walking stick ate theirs."
Exodus,7,13,"Pharaoh still refused to let the people go, just as the LORD had said. Pharaoh refused to listen to Moses and Aaron."
Exodus,7,14,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh is being stubborn. He refuses to let the people go."
Exodus,7,15,In the morning Pharaoh will go out to the river. Go to him by the edge of the Nile River. Take the walking stick that became a snake.
Exodus,7,16,"Tell him this: ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you. He told me to tell you to let his people go worship him in the desert. Until now you have not listened to the Lord."
Exodus,7,17,"So the LORD says that he will do something to show you that he is the says that he will do something to show you that he is the LORD. I will hit the water of the Nile River with this walking stick in my hand, and the river will turn into blood."
Exodus,7,18,"The fish in the river will die, and the river will begin to stink. Then the Egyptians will not be able to drink the water from the river.’”"
Exodus,7,19,"The LORD said to Moses: “Tell Aaron to hold the walking stick in his hand over the rivers, canals, lakes, and every place where they store water. When he does this, all the water will turn into blood. All the water, even the water stored in wood and stone jars, will turn into blood.”"
Exodus,7,20,So Moses and Aaron did what the LORD commanded. Aaron raised the walking stick and hit the water in the Nile River. He did this in front of Pharaoh and his officials. So all the water in the river changed into blood.
Exodus,7,21,"The fish in the river died, and the river began to stink. So the Egyptians could not drink water from the river. The blood was everywhere in Egypt."
Exodus,7,22,The magicians used their magic to do the same thing. So Pharaoh refused to listen to Moses and Aaron. This happened just as the LORD said.
Exodus,7,23,Pharaoh ignored what Moses and Aaron had done. He turned and went into his house.
Exodus,7,24,"The Egyptians could not drink the water from the river, so they dug wells around the river for water to drink."
Exodus,7,25,Seven days passed after the LORD changed the Nile River.
Exodus,8,1,"Then the LORD told Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and tell him that the told Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and tell him that the LORD says, ‘Let my people go to worship me!"
Exodus,8,2,"If you refuse to let my people go, then I will fill Egypt with frogs."
Exodus,8,3,The Nile River will be filled with frogs. They will come from the river and enter your houses. They will be in your bedrooms and in your beds. They will be in the houses of your officials and in your ovens and in your jars of water.
Exodus,8,4,"The frogs will be all over you, your people, and your officials.’”"
Exodus,8,5,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron to hold the walking stick in his hand over the canals, rivers, and lakes. Then the frogs will come out onto the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,8,6,"So Aaron raised his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs began coming out of the water and covered the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,7,The magicians used their magic to do the same thing—so even more frogs came out onto the land in Egypt!
Exodus,8,8,"Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Ask the LORD to remove the frogs from me and my people. I will let the people go to offer sacrifices to the to remove the frogs from me and my people. I will let the people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD.”"
Exodus,8,9,"Moses said to Pharaoh, “I will pray for you, your people, and your officials. Then the frogs will leave you and your houses. They will remain only in the river. When do you want the frogs to go away?”"
Exodus,8,10,"Pharaoh said, “Tomorrow.”
Moses said, “It will happen as you say. In this way you will know that there is no god like the LORD our God."
Exodus,8,11,"The frogs will leave you, your house, your officials, and your people. They will remain only in the river.”"
Exodus,8,12,Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh. Moses prayed to the LORD about the frogs he had sent against Pharaoh.
Exodus,8,13,"And the LORD did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, in the yards, and in the fields."
Exodus,8,14,"They began to rot, and the whole country began to stink."
Exodus,8,15,"But when Pharaoh saw that they were free of the frogs, he again became stubborn. Pharaoh did not do what Moses and Aaron had asked him to do. This happened just as the LORD had said."
Exodus,8,16,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron to raise his stick and hit the dust on the ground, and everywhere in Egypt dust will become lice.”"
Exodus,8,17,"They did this. Aaron raised the stick in his hand and hit the dust on the ground, and everywhere in Egypt the dust became lice. The lice got on the animals and the people."
Exodus,8,18,The magicians used their magic and tried to do the same thing. But the magicians could not make lice come from the dust. The lice remained on the animals and the people.
Exodus,8,19,So the magicians told Pharaoh that the power of God did this. But Pharaoh refused to listen to them. This happened just as the LORD had said.
Exodus,8,20,"The LORD said to Moses, “Get up in the morning and go to Pharaoh. He will go out to the river. Tell him that the said to Moses, “Get up in the morning and go to Pharaoh. He will go out to the river. Tell him that the LORD says, ‘Let my people go and worship me!"
Exodus,8,21,"If you don’t let my people go, then flies will come into your houses. The flies will be on you and your officials. The houses of Egypt will be full of flies. They will be all over the ground too!"
Exodus,8,22,"But I will not treat the Israelites the same as the Egyptians. There will not be any flies in Goshen, where my people live. In this way you will know that I, the LORD, am in this land."
Exodus,8,23,So tomorrow I will treat my people differently from your people. This will be my proof.’”
Exodus,8,24,"So the LORD did just what he said. Millions of flies came into Egypt. The flies were in Pharaoh’s house, and they were in all his officials’ houses. They were all over Egypt. The flies were ruining the country."
Exodus,8,25,"So Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and told them, “Offer sacrifices to your God here in this country.”"
Exodus,8,26,"But Moses said, “It would not be right to do that. The Egyptians think it is terrible to kill animals as sacrifices for the LORD our God. If we do this here, the Egyptians will see us and throw stones at us and kill us."
Exodus,8,27,Let us go three days into the desert and offer sacrifices to the LORD our God. This is what he told us to do.”
Exodus,8,28,"So Pharaoh said, “I will let you go and offer sacrifices to the LORD your God in the desert, but you must not go very far. Now, go and pray for me.”"
Exodus,8,29,"Moses said, “Look, I will leave and ask the LORD to remove the flies from you, your people, and your officials tomorrow. But you must not stop the people from offering sacrifices to the to remove the flies from you, your people, and your officials tomorrow. But you must not stop the people from offering sacrifices to the LORD.”"
Exodus,8,30,So Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
Exodus,8,31,"And the LORD did what Moses asked. He removed the flies from Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. None of the flies remained."
Exodus,8,32,But Pharaoh again became stubborn and did not let the people go.
Exodus,9,1,"Then the LORD told Moses to go to Pharaoh and tell him: “The told Moses to go to Pharaoh and tell him: “The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says, ‘Let my people go to worship me!’"
Exodus,9,2,If you continue to hold them and refuse to let them go
Exodus,9,3,"then the LORD will use his power against your animals in the fields. He will cause all of your horses, donkeys, camels, cattle, and sheep to get sick with a terrible disease."
Exodus,9,4,But the LORD will treat Israel’s animals differently from the animals of Egypt. None of the animals that belong to the Israelites will die.
Exodus,9,5,"The LORD has set the time for this to happen. He said, ‘Tomorrow the has set the time for this to happen. He said, ‘Tomorrow the LORD will make this happen in this country.’”"
Exodus,9,6,"The next morning the LORD did what he said. All the farm animals of the Egyptians died, but none of the animals that belonged to the Israelites died."
Exodus,9,7,Pharaoh sent people to see if any of the animals of Israel died. Not one of them died. But Pharaoh remained stubborn and did not let the people go.
Exodus,9,8,"The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Fill your hands with the ashes from a furnace. Moses, you throw the ashes into the air in front of Pharaoh."
Exodus,9,9,"This will become dust that will go throughout the land of Egypt. Whenever the dust touches a person or an animal in Egypt, sores will break out on the skin.”"
Exodus,9,10,"So Moses and Aaron took ashes from a furnace and went and stood before Pharaoh. Moses threw the ashes into the air, and sores began breaking out on people and animals."
Exodus,9,11,"The magicians could not stop Moses from doing this, because even the magicians had the sores. This happened everywhere in Egypt."
Exodus,9,12,"But the LORD made Pharaoh stubborn, so he refused to listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the made Pharaoh stubborn, so he refused to listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said."
Exodus,9,13,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get up in the morning and go to Pharaoh. Tell him that the said to Moses, “Get up in the morning and go to Pharaoh. Tell him that the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says, ‘Let my people go to worship me!"
Exodus,9,14,"This time, I will use my full power against you, your officials, and your people. Then you will know that there is no god in the world like me."
Exodus,9,15,I could use my power and cause a disease that would wipe you and your people off the earth.
Exodus,9,16,But I have put you here for a reason. I have put you here so that I could show you my power. Then people all over the world will learn about me!
Exodus,9,17,You are still against my people. You are not letting them go free.
Exodus,9,18,"So at this time tomorrow, I will cause a very bad hailstorm. There has never been a hailstorm like this in Egypt, not since Egypt became a nation."
Exodus,9,19,"Now, you must put your animals in a safe place. Everything you own that is now in the fields must be put in a safe place. Any person or animal that remains in the fields will be killed. The hail will fall on everything that is not gathered into your houses.’”"
Exodus,9,20,Some of Pharaoh’s officials paid attention to the LORD’s message. They quickly put all of their animals and slaves into houses.
Exodus,9,21,But other people ignored the LORD’s message and lost all their slaves and animals that were in the fields.
Exodus,9,22,"The LORD told Moses, “Raise your hand into the air and the hail will start falling all over Egypt. The hail will fall on all the people, animals, and plants in all the fields of Egypt.”"
Exodus,9,23,"So Moses raised his walking stick into the air, and the LORD sent hail with thunder and lightning down on the earth. The sent hail with thunder and lightning down on the earth. The LORD caused hail to fall all over Egypt."
Exodus,9,24,"The hail was falling, and lightning was flashing all through it. It was the worst hailstorm that had ever hit Egypt since it had become a nation."
Exodus,9,25,"The storm destroyed everything in the fields in Egypt. The hail destroyed people, animals, and plants. The hail also broke all the trees in the fields."
Exodus,9,26,"The only place that did not get hail was the land of Goshen, where the Israelites lived."
Exodus,9,27,"Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and told them, “This time I have sinned. The LORD is right, and I and my people are wrong."
Exodus,9,28,"We have had enough of this hail and thunder! Ask the LORD to stop the storm, and I will let you go. You don’t have to stay here.”"
Exodus,9,29,"Moses told Pharaoh, “When I leave the city, I will lift my hands in prayer to the LORD, and the thunder and hail will stop. Then you will know that the , and the thunder and hail will stop. Then you will know that the LORD is in this land."
Exodus,9,30,But I know that you and your officials don’t really fear and respect the LORD yet.”
Exodus,9,31,"The flax had already developed its seeds, and the barley was already blooming. So these plants were destroyed."
Exodus,9,32,"But wheat and spelt ripen later than the other grains, so these plants were not destroyed."
Exodus,9,33,"Moses left Pharaoh and went outside the city. He lifted his hands in prayer to the LORD. And the thunder and hail stopped, and then even the rain stopped."
Exodus,9,34,"When Pharaoh saw that the rain, hail, and thunder had stopped, he again did wrong. He and his officials became stubborn again."
Exodus,9,35,"Pharaoh refused to let the Israelites go free, just as the LORD had said through Moses."
Exodus,10,1,"The LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh. I have made him and his officials stubborn. I did this so that I could show them my powerful miracles."
Exodus,10,2,I also did this so that you could tell your children and your grandchildren about the miracles and other wonderful things that I have done in Egypt. Then all of you will know that I am the LORD.”
Exodus,10,3,"So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh. They told him, “The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says, ‘How long will you refuse to obey me? Let my people go to worship me!"
Exodus,10,4,"If you refuse to let my people go, then tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country."
Exodus,10,5,The locusts will cover the land. There will be so many locusts that you will not be able to see the ground. Anything that was left from the hailstorm will be eaten by the locusts. The locusts will eat all the leaves from every tree in the field.
Exodus,10,6,"They will fill all your houses, and all your officials’ houses, and all the houses in Egypt. There will be more locusts than your fathers or your grandfathers have ever seen. There will be more locusts than there have ever been since people began living in Egypt.’” Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh."
Exodus,10,7,"Then the officials asked Pharaoh, “How long will we be trapped by these people? Let the men go to worship the LORD their God. If you don’t let them go, before you know it, Egypt will be destroyed!”"
Exodus,10,8,"So Pharaoh told his officials to bring Moses and Aaron back to him. Pharaoh said to them, “Go and worship the LORD your God. But tell me, just who is going?”"
Exodus,10,9,"Moses answered, “All of our people, young and old, will go. And we will take our sons and daughters, and our sheep and cattle with us. We will all go because the LORD’s festival is for all of us.”"
Exodus,10,10,"Pharaoh said to them, “The LORD really will have to be with you before I let you and all of your children leave Egypt. Look, you are planning something evil."
Exodus,10,11,The men can go worship the LORD. That is what you asked for in the beginning. But all of your people cannot go.” Then Pharaoh sent Moses and Aaron away.
Exodus,10,12,"The LORD told Moses, “Raise your hand over the land of Egypt and the locusts will come! They will spread all over the land of Egypt and will eat all the plants that the hail did not destroy.”"
Exodus,10,13,"So Moses raised his walking stick over the land of Egypt, and the LORD caused a strong wind to blow from the east. The wind blew all that day and night. When morning came, the wind had brought the locusts to the land of Egypt."
Exodus,10,14,The locusts flew into the country of Egypt and landed on the ground. There were more locusts than there had ever been in Egypt. And there will never again be that many locusts there.
Exodus,10,15,"They covered the ground, and the whole country became dark. The locusts ate every plant on the ground and all the fruit in the trees that the hail had not destroyed. There were no leaves left on any of the trees or plants anywhere in Egypt."
Exodus,10,16,"Pharaoh quickly called for Moses and Aaron. Pharaoh said, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you."
Exodus,10,17,"Now, forgive me for my sins this time. Ask the LORD to remove this ‘death’ from me.”"
Exodus,10,18,Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
Exodus,10,19,"So the LORD changed the wind. He made a very strong wind blow from the west, and it blew the locusts out of Egypt and into the Red Sea. Not one locust was left in Egypt!"
Exodus,10,20,"But the LORD caused Pharaoh to be stubborn again, and Pharaoh did not let the Israelites go."
Exodus,10,21,"Then the LORD told Moses, “Raise your hand into the air and darkness will cover Egypt. It will be so dark you can feel it!”"
Exodus,10,22,So Moses raised his hand into the air and a cloud of darkness covered Egypt. The darkness stayed in Egypt for three days.
Exodus,10,23,"None of the people could see each other, and no one got up to go any place for three days. But there was light in all the places where the Israelites lived."
Exodus,10,24,"Again Pharaoh called for Moses. He said, “Go and worship the LORD! You can take your children with you. But you must leave your sheep and cattle here.”"
Exodus,10,25,"Moses said, “No, we will take them all. In fact, you will give us offerings and sacrifices for us to use in worshiping the LORD our God."
Exodus,10,26,"Yes, we will take our animals with us to worship the LORD our God. Not one hoof will be left behind. We don’t know yet exactly what we will need to worship the our God. Not one hoof will be left behind. We don’t know yet exactly what we will need to worship the LORD. We will learn that only when we get there.”"
Exodus,10,27,"The LORD made Pharaoh stubborn again, so he refused to let them go."
Exodus,10,28,"Then Pharaoh told Moses, “Get out of here. I don’t want you to come here again. The next time you come to see me, you will die!”"
Exodus,10,29,"Then Moses told Pharaoh, “You are right about one thing. I will not come to see you again.”"
Exodus,11,1,"Then the LORD told Moses, “I have one more disaster to bring against Pharaoh and Egypt. After this, he will ask you to leave Egypt. In fact, he will force you to leave this country."
Exodus,11,2,"You must give this message to the Israelites: ‘Men and women, you must ask your neighbors to give you things made of silver and gold.’”"
Exodus,11,3,"The LORD caused the Egyptians to be kind to the Israelites. The Egyptians, even Pharaoh’s own officials, already considered Moses to be a great man."
Exodus,11,4,"Moses said to the king, “The LORD says, ‘At midnight tonight, I will go through Egypt"
Exodus,11,5,"and every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, to the firstborn son of the slave girl grinding grain. Even the firstborn animals will die."
Exodus,11,6,The crying in Egypt will be worse than at any time in the past or any time in the future.
Exodus,11,7,But none of the Israelites or their animals will be hurt—not even a dog will bark at them.’ Then you will know that the LORD has treated Israel differently from Egypt.
Exodus,11,8,"All these officials of yours will come down and bow to me. They will say, ‘Leave and take all your people with you.’ Only then will I leave!” Then in anger, Moses left the meeting with Pharaoh."
Exodus,11,9,"Then the LORD told Moses, “The reason Pharaoh did not listen to you is so that I could show my great power in Egypt.”"
Exodus,11,10,That is why Moses and Aaron did all these great miracles in front of Pharaoh. And that is why the LORD made Pharaoh so stubborn that he would not let the Israelites leave his country.
Exodus,12,1,"While Moses and Aaron were still in Egypt, the LORD spoke to them. He said"
Exodus,12,2,“This month will be the first month of the year for you.
Exodus,12,3,This command is for the whole community of Israel: On the tenth day of this month each man must get one lamb for the people in his house.
Exodus,12,4,"If there are not enough people in his house to eat a whole lamb, then he should invite some of his neighbors to share the meal. There must be enough lamb for everyone to eat."
Exodus,12,5,"The lamb must be a one-year-old male, and it must be completely healthy. This animal can be either a young sheep or a young goat."
Exodus,12,6,You should watch over the animal until the 14th day of the month. On that day all the people of the community of Israel must kill these animals just before dark.
Exodus,12,7,You must collect the blood from these animals and put it on the top and sides of the doorframe of every house where the people eat this meal.
Exodus,12,8,“On this night you must roast the lamb and eat all the meat. You must also eat bitter herbs and bread made without yeast.
Exodus,12,9,"You must not eat the lamb raw or boiled in water. You must roast the whole lamb over a fire. The lamb must still have its head, legs, and inner parts."
Exodus,12,10,"You must eat all the meat that night. If any of the meat is left until morning, you must burn it in the fire."
Exodus,12,11,"“When you eat the meal, you must be fully dressed and ready to travel. You must have your sandals on your feet and your walking stick in your hand. You must eat in a hurry, because this is the LORD’s Passover."
Exodus,12,12,“Tonight I will go through Egypt and kill every firstborn man and animal in Egypt. In this way I will judge all the gods of Egypt and show that I am the LORD.
Exodus,12,13,"But the blood on your houses will be a special sign. When I see the blood, I will pass over your house. I will cause bad things to happen to the people of Egypt. But none of these bad diseases will hurt you."
Exodus,12,14,“You will always remember tonight—it will be a special festival for you. Your descendants will honor the LORD with this festival forever.
Exodus,12,15,"For this festival you will eat bread made without yeast for seven days. On the first day, you will remove all the yeast from your houses. No one should eat any yeast for the full seven days of this festival. Anyone who eats yeast must be separated from the rest of Israel."
Exodus,12,16,There will be holy assemblies on the first day and the last day of the festival. You must not do any work on these days. The only work you can do is preparing the food for your meals.
Exodus,12,17,"You must remember the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because on this day I took all of your people out of Egypt in groups. All of your descendants must remember this day. This is a law that will last forever."
Exodus,12,18,"So on the evening of the 14th day of the first month, you will begin eating bread without yeast. You will eat this bread until the evening of the 21st day of the same month."
Exodus,12,19,"For seven days, there must not be any yeast in your houses. Anyone, either a citizen of Israel or a foreigner living among you, who eats yeast at this time must be separated from the rest of Israel."
Exodus,12,20,During this festival you must not eat any yeast. You must eat bread without yeast wherever you live.”
Exodus,12,21,"So Moses called all the elders together and told them, “Get the lambs for your families. Kill the lambs for the Passover."
Exodus,12,22,Take bunches of hyssop and dip them in the bowls filled with blood. Paint the blood on the sides and top of each doorframe. No one must leave their house until morning.
Exodus,12,23,"At the time the LORD goes through Egypt to kill the firstborn, he will see the blood on the sides and top of each doorframe. Then he will protect that house and not let the Destroyer come into any of your houses and hurt you."
Exodus,12,24,You must remember this command. This law is for you and your descendants forever.
Exodus,12,25,You must remember to do this even when you go to the land the LORD is giving you.
Exodus,12,26,"When your children ask you, ‘Why are we doing this ceremony?’"
Exodus,12,27,"you will say, ‘This Passover is to honor the LORD, because when we were in Egypt, he passed over the houses of Israel. He killed the Egyptians, but he saved the people in our houses.’”
Then the people bowed down and worshiped the Lord."
Exodus,12,28,"The LORD had given this command to Moses and Aaron, so the Israelites did what the Lord commanded."
Exodus,12,29,"At midnight the LORD killed all the firstborn sons in Egypt, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh (who ruled Egypt) to the firstborn son of the prisoner sitting in jail. Also all the firstborn animals died."
Exodus,12,30,"That night someone died in every house in Egypt. Pharaoh, his officials, and all the people of Egypt began to cry loudly."
Exodus,12,31,"So that night Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said to them, “Get up and leave my people. You and your people can do as you say. Go and worship the LORD."
Exodus,12,32,"Take all of your sheep and cattle with you, just as you said you would. Go! And say a blessing for me too.”"
Exodus,12,33,"The people of Egypt also asked them to hurry and leave. They said, “If you don’t leave, we will all die!”"
Exodus,12,34,The Israelites did not have time to put the yeast in their bread. They just wrapped the bowls of dough with cloth and carried them on their shoulders.
Exodus,12,35,Then the Israelites did what Moses asked them to do. They went to their Egyptian neighbors and asked for clothing and things made from silver and gold.
Exodus,12,36,"The LORD caused the Egyptians to be kind to the Israelites, so the Egyptians gave their riches to the Israelites."
Exodus,12,37,"The Israelites traveled from Rameses to Succoth. There were about 600,000 men, not counting the small boys."
Exodus,12,38,"A great number of people who were not Israelites went with them, along with many sheep, cattle, and other livestock."
Exodus,12,39,The people did not have time to put yeast in their bread or make any special food for their journey. So they had to bake their bread without yeast.
Exodus,12,40,The Israelites had lived in Egypt for 430 years.
Exodus,12,41,"After 430 years, to the very day, all the armies of the LORD left Egypt."
Exodus,12,42,"The night they left, the LORD watched over them to bring them safely out of Egypt. So the Israelites will always celebrate this night each year to remember what the watched over them to bring them safely out of Egypt. So the Israelites will always celebrate this night each year to remember what the LORD did."
Exodus,12,43,"The LORD told Moses and Aaron, “These are the rules for Passover: No foreigner is allowed to eat the Passover meal."
Exodus,12,44,"A foreigner who is only a hired worker or is only staying in your country is not allowed to eat the meal. But if someone buys a slave and circumcises him, then the slave can eat the Passover meal."
Exodus,12,45,"A foreigner who is only a hired worker or is only staying in your country is not allowed to eat the meal. But if someone buys a slave and circumcises him, then the slave can eat the Passover meal."
Exodus,12,46,“Each family must eat the meal in one house. None of the food is to be taken outside the house. Don’t break any of the lamb’s bones.
Exodus,12,47,The whole community of Israel must do this ceremony.
Exodus,12,48,"If a foreigner living among you wants to share in the LORD’s Passover, he must be circumcised. Then he can share in the meal like any other citizen of Israel. But a man who is not circumcised cannot eat the Passover meal."
Exodus,12,49,The same rules are for everyone. It doesn’t matter if they are citizens or foreigners living among you.”
Exodus,12,50,So all the Israelites obeyed the commands that the LORD gave to Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,12,51,On that same day the LORD led all the Israelites out of the country of Egypt. The people left in groups.
Exodus,13,1,Then the LORD said to Moses
Exodus,13,2,“You must give me every male in Israel who is his mother’s first child. That means that every firstborn baby boy and every firstborn male animal will be mine.”
Exodus,13,3,"Moses said to the people, “Remember this day. You were slaves in Egypt, but on this day the LORD used his great power and made you free. You must not eat bread with yeast."
Exodus,13,4,"Today, in the month of Abib, you are leaving Egypt."
Exodus,13,5,"The LORD made a special promise to your ancestors. He promised to give you the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites. After the Lord leads you to the land filled with many good things, then you must remember this day. You must have a special day of worship on this day during the first month of every year."
Exodus,13,6,"“For seven days, you must eat only bread without yeast. On the seventh day there will be a great festival to show honor to the LORD."
Exodus,13,7,"So for seven days, you must not eat any bread made with yeast. There must be no bread with yeast any place in your land."
Exodus,13,8,"On this day you should tell your children, ‘We are having this festival because the LORD took me out of Egypt.’"
Exodus,13,9,“This festival will help you remember; it will be like a string tied on your hand. It will be like a sign before your eyes. This festival will help you remember the LORD’s teachings. It will help you remember that the ’s teachings. It will help you remember that the LORD used his great power to take you out of Egypt.
Exodus,13,10,So remember this festival every year at the right time.
Exodus,13,11,“The LORD will lead you into the land he promised to give you. The Canaanites live there now. But God promised your ancestors that he would give you this land. When that happens
Exodus,13,12,you must remember to give the LORD every firstborn boy. And every male animal that is the firstborn must also be given to the every firstborn boy. And every male animal that is the firstborn must also be given to the LORD.
Exodus,13,13,"Every firstborn donkey can be bought back. You can offer a lamb and keep the donkey. If you don’t want to buy back the donkey like this, then you must break its neck to kill it. But every firstborn baby boy must be bought back from the Lord."
Exodus,13,14,"“In the future, your children will ask why you do this. They will say, ‘What does all this mean?’ And you will answer, ‘The LORD used his great power to save us from Egypt. We were slaves in that place, but he led us out and brought us here."
Exodus,13,15,"In Egypt, Pharaoh was stubborn and refused to let us leave. So the LORD killed every firstborn in all the land. (The Lord killed the firstborn males—animal and human.) That is why I give every firstborn male animal to the killed every firstborn in all the land. (The Lord killed the firstborn males—animal and human.) That is why I give every firstborn male animal to the LORD, and that is why I buy back each of my firstborn sons from him.’"
Exodus,13,16,"This is like a string tied on your hand, like a sign in front of your eyes. It helps you remember that the LORD brought us out of Egypt with his great power.”"
Exodus,13,17,"Pharaoh made the people leave Egypt. God did not let the people take the road leading to the land of the Philistines. That road by the Mediterranean Sea is the shortest way, but God said, “If the people go that way they will have to fight. Then they might change their minds and go back to Egypt.”"
Exodus,13,18,So God led them another way through the desert by the Red Sea. The Israelites were dressed for war when they left Egypt.
Exodus,13,19,"Moses carried the bones of Joseph with him. Before Joseph died, he made the Israelites promise to do this for him. He said, “When God saves you, remember to carry my bones with you out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,13,20,The Israelites left Succoth and camped at Etham. Etham was near the desert.
Exodus,13,21,"The LORD led the way. During the day, he used a tall cloud to lead the people. And during the night, he used a tall column of fire to lead the way. This fire gave them light so that they could also travel at night."
Exodus,13,22,"The cloud was always with them during the day, and the column of fire was always with them at night."
Exodus,14,1,Then the LORD said to Moses
Exodus,14,2,"“Tell the people to go back to Pi Hahiroth. Tell them to spend the night between Migdol and the Red Sea, near Baal Zephon."
Exodus,14,3,Pharaoh will think that the Israelites are lost in the desert and that the people will have no place to go.
Exodus,14,4,"I will make Pharaoh brave, and he will chase you. But I will defeat Pharaoh and his army. This will bring honor to me. Then the people of Egypt will know that I am the LORD.” So the Israelites did what he told them."
Exodus,14,5,"Pharaoh received a report that the Israelites had escaped. When he heard this, he and his officials changed their minds about what they had done. Pharaoh said, “Why did we let the Israelites leave? Why did we let them run away? Now we have lost our slaves!”"
Exodus,14,6,So Pharaoh prepared his chariot and took his men with him.
Exodus,14,7,He took 600 of his best men and all of his chariots. There was an officer in each chariot.
Exodus,14,8,"The Israelites were leaving with their arms raised in victory. But the LORD caused Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to become brave. And Pharaoh chased the Israelites."
Exodus,14,9,"The Egyptian army had many horse soldiers and chariots. They chased the Israelites and caught up with them while they were camped near the Red Sea at Pi Hahiroth, east of Baal Zephon."
Exodus,14,10,"When the Israelites saw Pharaoh and his army coming toward them, they were very frightened and cried to the LORD for help."
Exodus,14,11,"They said to Moses, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt? Did you bring us out here in the desert to die? We could have died peacefully in Egypt; there were plenty of graves in Egypt."
Exodus,14,12,"We told you this would happen! In Egypt we said, ‘Please don’t bother us. Let us stay and serve the Egyptians.’ It would have been better for us to stay and be slaves than to come out here and die in the desert.”"
Exodus,14,13,"But Moses answered, “Don’t be afraid! Don’t run away! Stand where you are and watch the LORD save you today. You will never see these Egyptians again."
Exodus,14,14,You will not have to do anything but stay calm. The LORD will do the fighting for you.”
Exodus,14,15,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Why are you still crying to me? Tell the Israelites to start moving."
Exodus,14,16,"Raise the walking stick in your hand over the Red Sea, and the sea will split. Then the people can go across on dry land."
Exodus,14,17,"I have made the Egyptians brave, so they will chase you. But I will show you that I am more powerful than Pharaoh and all of his horses and chariots."
Exodus,14,18,Then Egypt will know that I am the LORD. They will honor me when I defeat Pharaoh and his horse soldiers and chariots.”
Exodus,14,19,"Then the angel of God moved to the back of the people. (The angel was usually in front of the people, leading them.) So the tall cloud moved from in front of the people and went to the back of the people."
Exodus,14,20,In this way the cloud stood between the Egyptians and the Israelites. There was light for the Israelites. But there was darkness for the Egyptians. So the Egyptians did not come any closer to the Israelites that night.
Exodus,14,21,"Moses raised his hand over the Red Sea, and the LORD caused a strong wind to blow from the east. The wind blew all night long. The sea split, and the wind made the ground dry."
Exodus,14,22,The Israelites went through the sea on dry land. The water was like a wall on their right and on their left.
Exodus,14,23,Then all of Pharaoh’s chariots and horse soldiers followed them into the sea.
Exodus,14,24,Early that morning the LORD looked down from the tall cloud and column of fire at the Egyptian army. Then he made them panic.
Exodus,14,25,"The wheels of the chariots became stuck. It was very hard to control the chariots. The Egyptians shouted, “Let’s get out of here! The LORD is fighting against us. He is fighting for the Israelites.”"
Exodus,14,26,"Then the LORD told Moses, “Raise your hand over the sea to make the water fall and cover the Egyptian chariots and horse soldiers.”"
Exodus,14,27,"So just before daylight, Moses raised his hand over the sea. And the water rushed back to its proper level. The Egyptians were running as fast as they could from the water, but the LORD swept them away with the sea."
Exodus,14,28,"The water returned to its normal level and covered the chariots and horse soldiers. Pharaoh’s army had been chasing the Israelites, but that army was destroyed. None of them survived!"
Exodus,14,29,But the Israelites crossed the sea on dry land. The water was like a wall on their right and on their left.
Exodus,14,30,"So that day the LORD saved the Israelites from the Egyptians. Later, the Israelites saw the dead bodies of the Egyptians on the shore of the Red Sea."
Exodus,14,31,"The Israelites saw the great power of the LORD when he defeated the Egyptians. So the people feared and respected the when he defeated the Egyptians. So the people feared and respected the LORD, and they began to trust the , and they began to trust the LORD and his servant Moses."
Exodus,15,1,"Then Moses and the Israelites began singing this song to the LORD:
“I will sing to the LORD!
He has done great things.
He threw horse and rider
into the sea."
Exodus,15,2,"The LORD is my strength.
He saves me,
and I sing songs of praise to him.
He is my God,
and I praise him.
He is the God of my ancestors,
and I honor him."
Exodus,15,3,"The LORD is a great soldier.
The LORD is his name."
Exodus,15,4,"He threw Pharaoh’s chariots
and soldiers into the sea.
Pharaoh’s very best soldiers
drowned in the Red Sea."
Exodus,15,5,"The deep water covered them,
and they sank to the bottom like rocks."
Exodus,15,6,"“LORD, your right hand is amazingly strong.
With your right hand, LORD, you broke the enemy to pieces."
Exodus,15,7,"In your great majesty you destroyed
those who stood against you.
Your anger destroyed them,
like fire burning straw."
Exodus,15,8,"The wind you sent in anger
piled the water high.
The flowing water became a wall,
solid to its deepest parts."
Exodus,15,9,"“The enemy said,
‘I’ll chase them and catch them.
I’ll take all their riches.
I’ll take it all with my sword.
I’ll take everything for myself.’"
Exodus,15,10,"But you blew on them
and covered them with the sea.
They sank like lead
into the deep sea."
Exodus,15,11,"“Are there any gods like the LORD?
No, there are no gods like you—
you are wonderfully holy!
You are amazingly powerful!
You do great miracles!"
Exodus,15,12,"You raised your right hand to punish the enemy,
and the ground opened up to swallow them."
Exodus,15,13,"But with your kindness
you led the people you saved.
And with your strength
you led them to your holy land."
Exodus,15,14,"“The other nations will hear this story,
and they will be frightened.
The Philistines will shake with fear."
Exodus,15,15,"The commanders of Edom will tremble.
The leaders of Moab will be afraid.
The people of Canaan will lose courage."
Exodus,15,16,"They will be filled with fear
when they see your strength.
They will be as still as a rock, LORD,
while your people, the ones you made, pass by."
Exodus,15,17,"You will lead your people
to your own mountain.
You will let them live by the place that you, LORD, prepared as your home.
It is the Temple, Lord, that you yourself built."
Exodus,15,18,“The LORD will rule forever and ever!”
Exodus,15,19,"Yes, it really happened! Pharaoh’s horses and riders, and chariots went into the sea. And the LORD brought all the water of the sea down on top of them. But the Israelites walked through that sea on dry land."
Exodus,15,20,"Then Aaron’s sister, the woman prophet Miriam, took a tambourine. She and the women began singing and dancing."
Exodus,15,21,"Miriam repeated the words,
“Sing to the LORD!
He has done great things.
He threw horse and rider
into the sea ….”"
Exodus,15,22,Moses led the Israelites away from the Red Sea and into the desert of Shur. They traveled for three days in the desert. They could not find any water.
Exodus,15,23,"Then they came to Marah. There was water at Marah, but it was too bitter to drink. (That is why the place was named Marah.)"
Exodus,15,24,"The people began complaining to Moses. They said, “Now what will we drink?”"
Exodus,15,25,"So Moses called to the LORD, and the , and the LORD showed him a large piece of wood. When Moses put the wood in the water, the water became good to drink.
There the LORD put in place a law and a command for him and tested him to see if he would obey."
Exodus,15,26,"He said to him, “I am the LORD your God. If you listen to me and do what I say is right, and if you obey all my commands and laws, then I will not give you any of the sicknesses that I gave the Egyptians. I am the your God. If you listen to me and do what I say is right, and if you obey all my commands and laws, then I will not give you any of the sicknesses that I gave the Egyptians. I am the LORD who heals you.”"
Exodus,15,27,Then the people traveled to Elim. At Elim there were twelve springs of water and 70 palm trees. So the people made their camp there near that water.
Exodus,16,1,"Then all the Israelites left Elim. They reached the western Sinai desert, between Elim and Mount Sinai, on the 15th day of the second month after leaving Egypt."
Exodus,16,2,Then the whole community of Israelites began complaining again. They complained to Moses and Aaron in the desert.
Exodus,16,3,"They said, “It would have been better if the LORD had just killed us in the land of Egypt. At least there we had plenty to eat. We had all the food we needed. But now you have brought us out here into this desert to make us all die from hunger.”"
Exodus,16,4,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “I will cause food to fall from the sky. This food will be for you to eat. Every day the people should go out and gather the food they need that day. I will do this to see if they will do what I tell them."
Exodus,16,5,"Every day the people will gather only enough food for one day. But on Friday, when the people prepare their food, they will see that they have enough food for two days.”"
Exodus,16,6,"So Moses and Aaron said to the Israelites, “Tonight you will see the power of the LORD. You will know that he is the one who brought you out of Egypt."
Exodus,16,7,"You have been complaining about the LORD, and he heard you. So tomorrow morning you will see the Glory of the , and he heard you. So tomorrow morning you will see the Glory of the LORD. You have been complaining and complaining about us. Maybe now we can have a little rest.”"
Exodus,16,8,"Then Moses said, “In the evening the LORD will give you meat to eat, and in the morning you will have all the bread you want. The will give you meat to eat, and in the morning you will have all the bread you want. The LORD will do this because he has heard your complaining, which was against him, not us. What can we do? We do only what he tells us to do, so your complaints are really against the will do this because he has heard your complaining, which was against him, not us. What can we do? We do only what he tells us to do, so your complaints are really against the LORD.”"
Exodus,16,9,"Then Moses said to Aaron, “Tell the whole community of Israelites to come together before the LORD, because he has heard their complaints.”"
Exodus,16,10,"So Aaron spoke to all the Israelites. While he was talking, the people turned and looked into the desert. And they saw the Glory of the LORD appear in a cloud."
Exodus,16,11,The LORD said to Moses
Exodus,16,12,"“I have heard the complaints of the Israelites. So tell them, ‘Tonight you will eat meat. And in the morning you will have all the bread you want. Then you will know you can trust the LORD, your God.’”"
Exodus,16,13,"That evening, flocks of quail came and filled the camp, and in the morning dew lay on the ground all around it."
Exodus,16,14,"After the dew was gone, something like thin flakes of frost was on the ground."
Exodus,16,15,"When the Israelites saw it, they asked each other, “What is that?” because they did not know what it was. So Moses told them, “This is the food the LORD is giving you to eat."
Exodus,16,16,"The LORD says, ‘Each of you should gather what you need, a basket of manna for everyone in your family.’”"
Exodus,16,17,"So that is what the Israelites did. Some people gathered a large amount, some people gathered a little."
Exodus,16,18,"But when they measured what they had gathered, there was no shortage and there was none left over. Everyone gathered just what they needed."
Exodus,16,19,"Moses told them, “Don’t save that food to eat the next day.”"
Exodus,16,20,But some of the people did not obey Moses. They saved their food for the next day. But worms got into the food and it began to stink. Moses was angry with the people who did this.
Exodus,16,21,"Every morning the people gathered as much food as they could eat, but by noon the food melted and was gone."
Exodus,16,22,On Friday the people gathered twice as much food—two baskets for every person. So all the leaders of the people came and told this to Moses.
Exodus,16,23,"Moses told them, “This is what the LORD said would happen. It happened because tomorrow is the Sabbath, the special day of rest to honor the said would happen. It happened because tomorrow is the Sabbath, the special day of rest to honor the LORD. You can cook all the food you need to cook for today, but save the rest of this food for tomorrow morning.”"
Exodus,16,24,"So the people saved the rest of the food for the next day, as Moses had commanded, and none of the food spoiled or had worms in it."
Exodus,16,25,"On Saturday, Moses told the people, “Today is the Sabbath, the special day of rest to honor the LORD. So none of you should be out in the fields. Eat the food you gathered yesterday."
Exodus,16,26,You should gather the food for six days. But the seventh day of the week is a day of rest—so there will not be any of the special food on the ground.”
Exodus,16,27,"On Saturday, some of the people went out to gather some of the food, but they could not find any."
Exodus,16,28,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “How long will you people refuse to obey my commands and teachings?"
Exodus,16,29,"Look, the LORD has made the Sabbath a day of rest for you. So on Friday he will give you enough food for two days. Then, on the Sabbath, each of you should sit down and relax. Stay where you are.”"
Exodus,16,30,So the people rested on the Sabbath.
Exodus,16,31,The people called the special food “manna.” It was like small white coriander seeds and tasted like thin cakes made with honey.
Exodus,16,32,Moses told the people what the LORD said: “Save a basket of this food for your descendants. Then they can see the food that I gave to you in the desert when I took you out of Egypt.”
Exodus,16,33,"So Moses told Aaron, “Take a jar and fill it with a full basket of manna. Save this manna to put before the LORD. Save it for our descendants.”"
Exodus,16,34,(Aaron did what the LORD had commanded Moses. Aaron put the jar of manna in front of the Box of the Agreement.)
Exodus,16,35,"The people ate the manna for 40 years, until they came to the land of rest, that is, until they came to the edge of the land of Canaan."
Exodus,16,36,(The measure they used for the manna was an omer. An omer was about 8 cups.)
Exodus,17,1,"The Israelites left the western Sinai desert. They traveled all together from place to place as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink."
Exodus,17,2,"So they turned against Moses and started arguing with him. They said, “Give us water to drink.”
Moses said to them, “Why have you turned against me? Why are you testing the LORD?”"
Exodus,17,3,"But the people were very thirsty, so they continued complaining to Moses. They said, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt? Did you bring us out here so that we, our children, and our cattle will all die without water?”"
Exodus,17,4,"So Moses cried to the LORD, “What can I do with these people? They are ready to kill me.”"
Exodus,17,5,"The LORD said to Moses, “Go before the Israelites. Take some of the elders of the people with you. Carry your walking stick with you. This is the stick that you used when you hit the Nile River."
Exodus,17,6,"I will stand before you on a rock at Horeb. Hit that rock with the walking stick and water will come out of it. Then the people can drink.”
Moses did these things and the elders of Israel saw it."
Exodus,17,7,"Moses named that place Meribah and Massah, because this was the place that the Israelites turned against him and tested the LORD. The people wanted to know if the . The people wanted to know if the LORD was with them or not."
Exodus,17,8,At Rephidim the Amalekites came and fought against the Israelites.
Exodus,17,9,"So Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some men and go and fight the Amalekites tomorrow. I will stand on the top of the hill and watch you. I will be holding the walking stick God gave me.”"
Exodus,17,10,"Joshua obeyed Moses and went to fight the Amalekites the next day. At the same time Moses, Aaron, and Hur went to the top of the hill."
Exodus,17,11,"Any time Moses held his hands in the air, the men of Israel would start winning the fight. But when Moses put his hands down, the men of Israel began to lose the fight."
Exodus,17,12,"After some time, Moses’ arms became tired. So they put a large rock under Moses for him to sit on. Then Aaron and Hur held Moses’ hands in the air. Aaron was on one side of Moses and Hur was on the other side. They held his hands up like this until the sun went down."
Exodus,17,13,So Joshua and his men defeated the Amalekites in this battle.
Exodus,17,14,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write about this battle. Write these things in a book so that people will remember what happened here. And be sure to tell Joshua that I will completely destroy the Amalekites from the earth.”"
Exodus,17,15,"Then Moses built an altar and named it, “The LORD is My Flag.”"
Exodus,17,16,"Moses said, “I lifted my hands toward the LORD’s throne. So the ’s throne. So the LORD fought against the Amalekites, as he always has.”"
Exodus,18,1,"Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, was a priest in Midian. He heard about the many ways that God helped Moses and the Israelites. He heard about the LORD leading the Israelites out of Egypt."
Exodus,18,2,"So Jethro went to Moses while Moses was camped near the mountain of God. Jethro brought Moses’ wife, Zipporah, with him. (Zipporah was not with Moses, because Moses had sent her home.)"
Exodus,18,3,"Jethro also brought Moses’ two sons with him. The first son was named Gershom, because when he was born, Moses said, “I am a stranger in a foreign country.”"
Exodus,18,4,"The other son was named Eliezer, because when he was born, Moses said, “The God of my father helped me and saved me from the king of Egypt.”"
Exodus,18,5,So Jethro went to Moses while Moses was camped in the desert near the mountain of God. Moses’ wife and his two sons were with Jethro.
Exodus,18,6,"Jethro sent a message to Moses that said, “This is your father-in-law Jethro. I am bringing your wife and her two sons to you.”"
Exodus,18,7,So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law. Moses bowed down before him and kissed him. The two men asked about each other’s health. Then they went into Moses’ tent to talk more.
Exodus,18,8,Moses told Jethro everything the LORD had done for the Israelites. He told what the Lord did to Pharaoh and the people of Egypt. He told about all the problems they had along the way. And he told his father-in-law how the had done for the Israelites. He told what the Lord did to Pharaoh and the people of Egypt. He told about all the problems they had along the way. And he told his father-in-law how the LORD saved the Israelites every time there was trouble.
Exodus,18,9,Jethro was happy when he heard all the good things the LORD had done for Israel. He was glad that the Lord had freed the Israelites from the Egyptians.
Exodus,18,10,"He said, “Praise the LORD! He freed you from the power of Egypt. He saved you from Pharaoh."
Exodus,18,11,"Now I know the LORD is greater than all the gods. They thought they were in control, but look what God did!”"
Exodus,18,12,Jethro got some sacrifices and offerings to honor God. Then Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat with Moses’ father-in-law Jethro. They all ate together there with God.
Exodus,18,13,"The next day, Moses had the special job of judging the people. There were so many people that they had to stand before him all day."
Exodus,18,14,"Jethro saw Moses judging the people. He asked, “Why are you doing this? Why are you the only judge? And why do people come to you all day?”"
Exodus,18,15,"Then Moses said to his father-in-law, “The people come to me and ask me to ask for God’s decision for their problem."
Exodus,18,16,"If people have an argument, they come to me, and I decide which person is right. In this way I teach the people God’s laws and teachings.”"
Exodus,18,17,"But Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “This isn’t the right way to do this."
Exodus,18,18,It is too much work for you to do alone. You cannot do this job by yourself. It wears you out. And it makes the people tired too.
Exodus,18,19,"Now, listen to me. Let me give you some advice. And I pray God will be with you. You should continue listening to the problems of the people. And you should continue to speak to God about these things."
Exodus,18,20,You should explain God’s laws and teachings to the people. Warn them not to break the laws. Tell them the right way to live and what they should do.
Exodus,18,21,"But you should also choose some of the people to be judges and leaders.
“Choose good men you can trust—men who respect God. Choose men who will not change their decisions for money. Make these men rulers over the people. There should be rulers over 1000 people, 100 people, 50 people, and even over ten people."
Exodus,18,22,"Let these rulers judge the people. If there is a very important case, then they can come to you and let you decide what to do. But they can decide the other cases themselves. In this way these men will share your work with you, and it will be easier for you to lead the people."
Exodus,18,23,"If you do this as God directs you, then you will be able to do your job without tiring yourself out. And the people can still have all their problems solved before they return home.”"
Exodus,18,24,So Moses did what Jethro told him.
Exodus,18,25,"Moses chose good men from among the Israelites. He made them leaders over the people. There were rulers over 1000 people, 100 people, 50 people, and ten people."
Exodus,18,26,"These rulers were judges for the people. The people could always bring their arguments to these rulers, and Moses had to decide only the most important cases."
Exodus,18,27,"After a short time Moses said goodbye to his father-in-law Jethro, and Jethro went back to his own home."
Exodus,19,1,The Israelites reached the desert of Sinai in the third month of their trip from Egypt.
Exodus,19,2,They had traveled from Rephidim to the Sinai desert. The Israelites camped in the desert near Mount Sinai.
Exodus,19,3,"Then Moses climbed up the mountain to meet with God. The LORD spoke to him on the mountain and said, “Tell this to the Israelites, the great family of Jacob"
Exodus,19,4,‘You people saw what I did to the people of Egypt. You saw that I carried you out of Egypt like an eagle and brought you here to me.
Exodus,19,5,"So now I tell you to obey my commands and keep my agreement. So if you do this, you will be my own special people. The whole world belongs to me, but I am choosing you to be my own special people."
Exodus,19,6,"You will be a special nation—a kingdom of priests.’ Moses, you must tell the Israelites what I have said.”"
Exodus,19,7,So Moses climbed down the mountain and called the elders of the people together. Moses told the elders everything the LORD had commanded him to tell them.
Exodus,19,8,"All the people spoke at the same time and said, “We will obey everything the LORD says.”
Then Moses went back up the mountain and told the Lord that the people would obey him."
Exodus,19,9,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “I will come to you in the thick cloud. I will speak to you. All the people will hear me talking to you. I will do this so that they will always believe what you tell them.”
Then Moses told God everything the people had said."
Exodus,19,10,"And the LORD said to Moses, “Today and tomorrow you must prepare the people for a special meeting. They must wash their clothes"
Exodus,19,11,"and be ready for me on the third day. On the third day, the LORD will come down to Mount Sinai. And all the people will see me."
Exodus,19,12,But you must tell the people to stay away from the mountain. Make a line and don’t let them cross it. Any person or animal that touches the mountain must be killed with stones or shot with arrows. But don’t let anyone touch them. The people must wait until the trumpet blows. Only then can they go up the mountain.”
Exodus,19,13,But you must tell the people to stay away from the mountain. Make a line and don’t let them cross it. Any person or animal that touches the mountain must be killed with stones or shot with arrows. But don’t let anyone touch them. The people must wait until the trumpet blows. Only then can they go up the mountain.”
Exodus,19,14,So Moses climbed down the mountain and went to the people. He got them ready for the special meeting and they washed their clothes.
Exodus,19,15,"Then Moses said to the people, “Be ready for the meeting with God in three days. Until that time do not have sexual relations.”"
Exodus,19,16,"On the morning of the third day, a thick cloud came down onto the mountain. There was thunder and lightning and a very loud sound from a trumpet. All the people in the camp were frightened."
Exodus,19,17,Then Moses led the people out of the camp to a place near the mountain to meet God.
Exodus,19,18,Mount Sinai was covered with smoke. Smoke rose off the mountain like smoke from a furnace. This happened because the LORD came down to the mountain in fire. Also the whole mountain began to shake.
Exodus,19,19,"The noise from the trumpet became louder and louder. Every time Moses spoke to God, God answered him with a voice like thunder."
Exodus,19,20,So the LORD came down to Mount Sinai. He came from heaven to the top of the mountain. Then he called Moses to come up to the top of the mountain with him. So Moses went up the mountain.
Exodus,19,21,"The LORD said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people not to come near me and look at me. If they do, many will die."
Exodus,19,22,"Also tell the priests who come near the LORD that they must prepare themselves for this special meeting. If they don’t, I, the that they must prepare themselves for this special meeting. If they don’t, I, the LORD, will punish them.”"
Exodus,19,23,"Moses said to the LORD, “But the people cannot come up the mountain. You yourself told us to make a line and not allow the people to cross the line to holy ground.”"
Exodus,19,24,"The LORD said to him, “Go down to the people. Get Aaron and bring him back with you. But don’t let the priests or the people come near me. I will punish them if they come too close.”"
Exodus,19,25,So Moses went down to the people and told them these things.
Exodus,20,1,These are the things God told his people
Exodus,20,2,"“I am the LORD your God. I am the one who freed you from the land of Egypt, where you were slaves."
Exodus,20,3,“You must not worship any other gods except me.
Exodus,20,4,“You must not make any idols. Don’t make any statues or pictures of anything up in the sky or of anything on the earth or of anything down in the water.
Exodus,20,5,"Don’t worship or serve idols of any kind, because I, the LORD, am your God. I hate my people worshiping other gods. People who sin against me become my enemies, and I will punish them. And I will punish their children, their grandchildren, and even their great-grandchildren."
Exodus,20,6,But I will be very kind to people who love me and obey my commands. I will be kind to their families for thousands of generations.
Exodus,20,7,"“You must not use the name of the LORD your God to make empty promises. If you do, the your God to make empty promises. If you do, the LORD will not let you go unpunished."
Exodus,20,8,“You must remember to keep the Sabbath a special day.
Exodus,20,9,You may work six days a week to do your job.
Exodus,20,10,"But the seventh day is a day of rest in honor of the LORD your God. So on that day no one should work—not you, your sons and daughters, or your men and women slaves. Even your animals and the foreigners living in your cities must not work!"
Exodus,20,11,"That is because the LORD worked six days and made the sky, the earth, the sea, and everything in them. And on the seventh day, he rested. In this way the worked six days and made the sky, the earth, the sea, and everything in them. And on the seventh day, he rested. In this way the LORD blessed the Sabbath—the day of rest. He made that a very special day."
Exodus,20,12,“You must honor and respect your father and your mother. Do this so that you will have a full life in the land that the LORD your God gives you.
Exodus,20,13,“You must not murder anyone.
Exodus,20,14,“You must not commit adultery.
Exodus,20,15,“You must not steal anything.
Exodus,20,16,“You must not tell lies about other people.
Exodus,20,17,“You must not want to take your neighbor’s house. You must not want his wife. And you must not want his men and women servants or his cattle or his donkeys. You must not want to take anything that belongs to another person.”
Exodus,20,18,"During all this time, the people in the valley heard the thundering and saw the lightning on the mountain. They saw smoke rising from the mountain and heard the sound of the trumpet. They were afraid and shook with fear. They stood away from the mountain and watched."
Exodus,20,19,"Then the people said to Moses, “If you want to speak to us, then we will listen. But please don’t let God speak to us. If this happens, we will die.”"
Exodus,20,20,"Then Moses said to them, “Don’t be afraid! God has come to test you. He wants you to respect him so that you will not sin.”"
Exodus,20,21,The people stood far away from the mountain while Moses went to the dark cloud where God was.
Exodus,20,22,Then the LORD told Moses to say this to the Israelites: “You people have seen that I talked with you from heaven.
Exodus,20,23,So you must not make idols using gold or silver to compete with me. You must not make these false gods.
Exodus,20,24,“Make a special altar for me. You should use dirt to make this altar. Offer sheep and cattle as burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on this altar. Do this in every place where I tell you to remember me. Then I will come and bless you.
Exodus,20,25,"But if you use stones to make an altar, then don’t use stones that were cut with an iron tool. If you do that, it will make the altar unacceptable."
Exodus,20,26,"And you must not make steps leading up to the altar. If there are steps, when people look up to the altar, they will be able to see under your clothes.”"
Exodus,21,1,"Then God said to Moses, “These are the other laws that you will give to the people"
Exodus,21,2,"“If you buy a Hebrew slave, then that slave will serve for only six years. After six years, he will be free, and he will have to pay nothing."
Exodus,21,3,"If he is not married when he becomes your slave, when he becomes free, he will leave without a wife. But if the man is married when he becomes your slave, then he will keep his wife at the time he is made free."
Exodus,21,4,"If the slave is not married, the master can give him a wife. If that wife gives birth to sons or daughters, she and her children will belong to the master. After the slave is finished with his years of service, he will be made free."
Exodus,21,5,"“But if the slave decides that he wants to stay with the master, he must say, ‘I love my master. I love my wife and my children. I will not become free—I will stay.’"
Exodus,21,6,"If this happens, the master will bring the slave before God. The master will take the slave to a door or the wooden frame around the door and pierce the slave’s ear using a sharp tool to show that the slave will serve that master for all his life."

Exodus,30,33,Whoever makes a perfume like that and puts it on anyone except a priest must be separated from the people.”
Exodus,30,34,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get these sweet-smelling spices: resin, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense. Be sure that you have equal amounts of these spices."
Exodus,30,35,Mix the spices together to make a sweet-smelling incense. Do this the same as a perfume maker would do it. Also mix salt with this incense. This will make it pure and special.
Exodus,30,36,Grind some of the incense until it becomes a fine powder. Put the powder in front of the Holy Box that holds the Agreement in the Meeting Tent. This is the place where I meet with you. You must use this incense powder only for its very special purpose.
Exodus,30,37,You must use it only in this special way for the LORD. You must also make it in a special way. Don’t make any other incense in this way.
Exodus,30,38,There may be people who will want to make some of this incense for themselves so that they can enjoy the smell. But whoever does this must be separated from their people.”
Exodus,31,1,Then the LORD said to Moses
Exodus,31,2,“I have chosen a man from the tribe of Judah to do some special work for me. His name is Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur.

Exodus,31,4,"He is a very good designer. And he can make things from gold, silver, and bronze."
Exodus,31,5,He can cut and set beautiful jewels. And he can work with wood. He can do all kinds of work.
Exodus,31,6,I have also chosen Oholiab to work with him. Oholiab is the son of Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan. And I have given skills to all the other workers so that they can make everything that I have commanded you
Exodus,31,7,"the Meeting Tent;
the Box of the Agreement;
the mercy-cover that is on it"
Exodus,31,8,"the table and everything on it;
the pure gold lampstand and everything used with it;
the altar for burning incense"
Exodus,31,9,"the altar for burning offerings and the things used at the altar;
the bowl and the base under it"
Exodus,31,10,"the special clothes for Aaron the priest;
the special clothes for Aaron’s sons when they serve as priests"
Exodus,31,11,"the sweet-smelling anointing oil;
the sweet-smelling incense for the Holy Place.
These workers must make everything the way that I have commanded you.”"
Exodus,31,12,Then the LORD said to Moses
Exodus,31,13,"“Tell the Israelites this: ‘You must follow the rules about my special days of rest. You must do this because they will be a sign between you and me for all generations. This will show you that I, the LORD, have made you my special people."
Exodus,31,14,"“‘Make the Sabbath a special day. If someone treats the Sabbath like any other day, that person must be killed. Whoever works on the Sabbath day must be separated from their people."
Exodus,31,15,There are six other days in the week for working. But the seventh day is a very special day of rest. That is the special day to honor the LORD. Anyone who works during the Sabbath must be killed.
Exodus,31,16,The Israelites must remember the Sabbath and make it a special day. They must continue to do this forever. It is an agreement between them and me that will continue forever.
Exodus,31,17,"The Sabbath will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever.’” (The LORD worked six days and made the sky and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and relaxed.)"
Exodus,31,18,"When God finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two stone tablets of the agreement. God had written on the stones with his finger."
Exodus,32,1,"The people saw that a long time had passed and Moses had not come down from the mountain. So they gathered around Aaron. They said to him, “Look, Moses led us out of the land of Egypt, but we don’t know what has happened to him. So make us some gods to go before us and lead us.”"
Exodus,32,2,"Aaron said to the people, “Bring me the gold earrings that belong to your wives, sons, and daughters.”"
Exodus,32,3,So the people collected all their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron.
Exodus,32,4,"He took the gold from the people and used it to make an idol. Using a special tool, he shaped the gold into a statue of a calf.
Then the people said, “Israel, here are your gods! These are the gods that brought you out of the land of Egypt!”"
Exodus,32,5,"Aaron saw all these things, so he built an altar in front of the calf. Then Aaron made an announcement. He said, “Tomorrow will be a special festival to honor the LORD.”"
Exodus,32,6,The people woke up very early the next morning. They killed animals and offered them as burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. They sat down to eat and drink. Then they got up and had a wild party.
Exodus,32,7,"At the same time, the LORD said to Moses, “Go down from this mountain. Your people, the people you brought out of the land of Egypt, have committed a terrible sin."
Exodus,32,8,"They have very quickly turned away from what I commanded them to do. They made a calf from melted gold for themselves. They are worshiping that calf and making sacrifices to it. The people have said, ‘Israel, these are the gods that led you out of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,32,9,"The LORD said to Moses, “I have seen these people, and I know that they are very stubborn. They will always turn against me."
Exodus,32,10,So now let me destroy them in anger. Then I will make a great nation from you.”
Exodus,32,11,"But Moses begged the LORD his God, “ his God, “LORD, don’t let your anger destroy your people. You brought them out of Egypt with your great power and strength."
Exodus,32,12,"But if you destroy your people, the Egyptians will say, ‘God planned to do bad things to his people. That is why he led them out of Egypt. He wanted to kill them in the mountains. He wanted to wipe them off the earth.’ So don’t be angry with your people. Please change your mind! Don’t destroy them."
Exodus,32,13,"Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. These men served you, and you used your name to make a promise to them. You said, ‘I will make your people as many as the stars in the sky. I will give your people all this land as I promised. This land will be theirs forever.’”"
Exodus,32,14,So the LORD felt sorry for the people. He did not do what he said he might do—he did not destroy them.
Exodus,32,15,"Then Moses went down the mountain. He had the two stone tablets with the agreement on them. The commandments were written on both sides of the stone, front and back."
Exodus,32,16,"God himself made the stones, and God himself wrote the commandments on them."
Exodus,32,17,"Joshua heard the noise from the party in camp. He said to Moses, “It sounds like war down in the camp!”"
Exodus,32,18,"Moses answered, “It is not the noise of an army shouting for victory. And it is not the noise of an army crying from defeat. The noise I hear is the sound of music.”"
Exodus,32,19,"When Moses came near the camp, he saw the golden calf and the people dancing. He became very angry, and he threw the stone tablets on the ground. The stones broke into several pieces at the bottom of the mountain."
Exodus,32,20,Then Moses destroyed the calf that the people had made. He melted it in the fire. Then he ground the gold until it became dust and threw it into the water. Then he forced the Israelites to drink that water.
Exodus,32,21,"Moses said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you that would make you do this? Why did you lead them to do such a terrible sin?”"
Exodus,32,22,"Aaron answered, “Don’t be angry, sir. You know that these people are always ready to do wrong."
Exodus,32,23,"The people said to me, ‘Moses led us out of Egypt, but we don’t know what has happened to him. So make us some gods to lead us.’"

Exodus,32,25,"Moses saw that Aaron had let the people get out of control. They were being wild, and all their enemies could see them acting like fools."
Exodus,32,26,"So Moses stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Anyone who wants to follow the LORD should come to me.” Everyone from the tribe of Levi ran to Moses."
Exodus,32,27,"Then Moses said to them, “I will tell you what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Every man must get his sword and go from one end of the camp to the other. You men must kill those who are against the Lord, even if they are your brothers, friends, or neighbors.’”"
Exodus,32,28,The people from the tribe of Levi obeyed Moses. That day about 3000 of the people died.

Exodus,32,30,"The next morning Moses told the people, “You have committed a terrible sin! But now I will go up to the LORD, and maybe I can do something so that he will forgive you for your sin.”"
Exodus,32,31,"So Moses went back to the LORD and said, “Please listen! These people committed a terrible sin and made a god from gold."
Exodus,32,32,"Now, forgive them of this sin. If you will not forgive them, then erase my name from your book.”"
Exodus,32,33,"But the LORD said to Moses, “The only people I erase from my book are those who sin against me."
Exodus,32,34,"So now, go down and lead the people where I tell you to go. My angel will go before you and lead you. When the time comes to punish those who sinned, they will be punished.”"
Exodus,32,35,So the LORD caused a terrible sickness to come to the people. He did this because they told Aaron to make the golden calf.

Exodus,33,3,"So go to the land filled with many good things, but I will not go with you. You people are very stubborn. If I go with you, I might destroy you along the way.”"
Exodus,33,4,"The people heard this bad news and became very sad, so they stopped wearing jewelry."
Exodus,33,5,"This was because the LORD said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘You are a stubborn people. I might destroy you even if I travel with you only a short time. So take off all your jewelry while I decide what to do with you.’”"
Exodus,33,6,So the Israelites stopped wearing their jewelry at Mount Horeb.
Exodus,33,7,Moses used to take a tent a short way outside the camp. He called it “the meeting tent.” Anyone who wanted to ask something from the LORD would go to the meeting tent outside the camp.
Exodus,33,8,"Any time Moses went out to the tent, all the people watched him. They stood at the entrance of their tents and watched Moses until he entered the meeting tent."
Exodus,33,9,"Whenever Moses went into the tent, the tall cloud would come down and stay at the entrance to the tent. And the Lord would speak with Moses."
Exodus,33,10,"So when the people saw the cloud at the entrance of the tent, they would go to the entrance of their own tents and bow down to worship God."
Exodus,33,11,"In this way the LORD spoke to Moses face to face like a man speaks with his friend. Then Moses would go back to the camp, but his helper, Joshua son of Nun, always stayed in the tent."
Exodus,33,12,"Moses said to the LORD, “You told me to lead these people, but you did not say who you would send with me. You said to me, ‘I know you very well, and I am pleased with you.’"
Exodus,33,13,"If I have really pleased you, then teach me your ways. I want to know you. Then I can continue to please you. Remember that these people are your nation.”"
Exodus,33,14,"The Lord answered, “I myself will go with you. I will lead you.”"
Exodus,33,15,"Then Moses said to him, “If you don’t go with us, then don’t make us leave this place."
Exodus,33,16,"Also, how will we know if you are pleased with me and these people? If you go with us, we will know for sure. If you don’t go with us, these people and I will be no different from any other people on the earth.”"
Exodus,33,17,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “I will do what you ask. I will do this because I am pleased with you and because I know you very well.”"
Exodus,33,18,"Then Moses said, “Now, please show me your Glory.”"
Exodus,33,19,"Then the Lord answered, “I will show my love and mercy to anyone I want to. So I will cause my perfect goodness to pass by in front of you, and I will speak my name, YAHWEH, so that you can hear it."
Exodus,33,20,But you cannot see my face. No one can see me and continue to live.”
Exodus,33,21,"Then the LORD said, “Here is a place for you to stand by me on this large rock."
Exodus,33,22,"I will put you in a large crack in that rock. Then I will cover you with my hand, and my Glory will pass by."

Exodus,34,1,"Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make two more stone tablets like the first two that were broken. I will write the same words on these stones that were written on the first two stones."
Exodus,34,2,Be ready tomorrow morning and come up on Mount Sinai. Stand before me there on the top of the mountain.
Exodus,34,3,No one will be allowed to come with you. No one should even be seen anywhere on the mountain. Even your herds of animals or flocks of sheep will not be allowed to eat grass at the bottom of the mountain.”
Exodus,34,4,"So Moses made two more stone tablets like the first ones. Early the next morning Moses went up Mount Sinai, just as the LORD had commanded. Moses carried the two stone tablets with him."
Exodus,34,5,"Then the LORD came down to him in a cloud, stood there with Moses, and spoke his own name."
Exodus,34,6,"That is, the LORD passed in front of Moses and said, “YAHWEH, the passed in front of Moses and said, “YAHWEH, the LORD, is a kind and merciful God. He is slow to become angry. He is full of great love. He can be trusted."
Exodus,34,7,"He shows his faithful love to thousands of people. He forgives people for the wrong things they do, but he does not forget to punish guilty people. Not only will he punish the guilty people, but their children, their grandchildren, and their great-grandchildren will also suffer for the bad things these people do.”"
Exodus,34,8,Then Moses quickly bowed to the ground and worshiped the Lord. Moses said
Exodus,34,9,"“Lord, if you are pleased with me, please go with us. I know that these are stubborn people, but forgive us for the bad things we did. Accept us as your people.”"
Exodus,34,10,"Then the Lord said, “I am making this agreement with all of your people. I will do amazing things that have never before been done for any other nation on earth. The people with you will see that I, the LORD, am very great. They will see the wonderful things that I will do for you."

Exodus,34,28,Moses stayed there with the LORD for 40 days and 40 nights. Moses did not eat any food or drink any water. And he wrote the words of the agreement (the Ten Commandments) on the two stone tablets.
Exodus,34,29,"When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, he carried the two stone tablets of the agreement. Because he had talked with the Lord, his face was shining, but he did not know it."
