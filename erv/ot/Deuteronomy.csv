Deuteronomy,1,1,"These are the commands that Moses gave the Israelites while they were in the Jordan Valley, in the desert east of the Jordan River. This was across from Suph, between the desert of Paran and the cities Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab."
Deuteronomy,1,2,The trip from Mount Horeb through the mountains of Seir to Kadesh Barnea takes only eleven days.
Deuteronomy,1,3,"But it was 40 years from the time the Israelites left Egypt until the time they came to this place. On the first day of the eleventh month of the 40th year, Moses spoke to the people and told them everything the LORD commanded."
Deuteronomy,1,4,This was after he defeated Sihon and Og. (Sihon was the king of the Amorites and lived in Heshbon. Og was the king of Bashan and lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei.)
Deuteronomy,1,5,The Israelites were in Moab on the east side of the Jordan River when Moses began to explain what God had commanded
Deuteronomy,1,6,"“At Mount Horeb the LORD our God spoke to us. He said, ‘You have stayed at this mountain long enough."
Deuteronomy,1,7,"Go to the hill country where the Amorites live and to all the neighboring areas in the Jordan Valley, the hill country, the western slopes, the Negev, and the seacoast. Go throughout the land of Canaan and Lebanon as far as the great river, the Euphrates."
Deuteronomy,1,8,"Look, I am giving you this land. Go and take it. It is the land that I, the LORD, promised to give to your ancestors—Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I promised to give this land to them and to their descendants.’"
Deuteronomy,1,9,"“At that time I told you, ‘I can’t take care of you by myself."
Deuteronomy,1,10,"And now, there are even more of you. The LORD your God has added more and more people, so that today you are as many as the stars in the sky."
Deuteronomy,1,11,"May the LORD, the God of your ancestors, give you 1000 times more people than you are now! May he bless you as he promised."
Deuteronomy,1,12,But I cannot take care of you and solve all your arguments by myself.
Deuteronomy,1,13,"So choose some men from each tribe, and I will make them leaders over you. Choose wise men with experience who understand people.’"
Deuteronomy,1,14,"“And you said, ‘That is a good thing to do.’"
Deuteronomy,1,15,"“So I took the wise, experienced men you chose from your tribes, and I made them your leaders. In this way I gave you leaders over 1000 people, over 100 people, over 50 people, and over 10 people. I also gave you officers for each of your tribes."
Deuteronomy,1,16,"“At that time I told these judges, ‘Listen to the arguments between your people. Be fair when you judge each case. It doesn’t matter if the problem is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner. You must judge each case fairly."
Deuteronomy,1,17,"You must treat everyone the same when you judge. You must listen carefully to everyone—whether they are important or not. Don’t be afraid of anyone, because your decision is from God. But if there is a case too hard for you to judge, bring it to me and I will judge it.’"
Deuteronomy,1,18,At that same time I also told you everything you must do.
Deuteronomy,1,19,"“So we obeyed the LORD our God. We left Mount Horeb and went to the hill country of the Amorites. You remember that big, terrible desert that we walked through. We came as far as Kadesh Barnea."
Deuteronomy,1,20,"Then I said to you, ‘You have now come to the hill country of the Amorites. The LORD our God will give us this country."
Deuteronomy,1,21,"Look, there it is! Go up and take the land for your own. The LORD, the God of your ancestors, told you to do this, so don’t be afraid or worry about anything.’"
Deuteronomy,1,22,"“But all of you came to me and said, ‘Let’s send some men to look at the land first. They can spy out the land and come back and tell us the way we should go and which cities we will come to.’"
Deuteronomy,1,23,"“I thought that was a good idea. So I chose twelve men from among you, one man from each tribe."
Deuteronomy,1,24,Then they left and went up to the hill country. They came to the Valley of Eshcol and explored it.
Deuteronomy,1,25,"They took some of the fruit from that land and brought it back to us. They told us about the land and said, ‘The LORD our God is giving us a good land.’"
Deuteronomy,1,26,“But you refused to go into the land. You refused to obey the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy,1,27,"You went to your tents and began to complain. You said, ‘The LORD hates us! He brought us out of the land of Egypt just to let the Amorites destroy us."
Deuteronomy,1,28,"Where can we go now? The men we sent have frightened us with their report. They said, “The people there are bigger and taller than we are. The cities are big and have walls as high as the sky. And we saw giants there!”’"
Deuteronomy,1,29,"“So I said to you, ‘Don’t be upset or afraid of those people."
Deuteronomy,1,30,"The LORD your God is in front, leading you. He will fight for you just as he did in Egypt."
Deuteronomy,1,31,You saw what happened in the desert. You saw how the LORD your God carried you like a man carries his child. He brought you safely all the way to this place.’
Deuteronomy,1,32,“But you didn’t trust the LORD your God then either.
Deuteronomy,1,33,"But he was always in front, going ahead to find a place for you to camp. At night, he was in the fire that showed you where to go. And during the day, he was in the cloud."
Deuteronomy,1,34,"“The LORD heard what you said, and he was angry. He made a vow. He said"
Deuteronomy,1,35,‘Not one of you evil people who are alive now will go into the good land that I promised to your ancestors.
Deuteronomy,1,36,"Only Caleb son of Jephunneh will see that land. I will give Caleb the land he walked on, and I will give that land to his descendants, because he did all that I, the LORD, commanded.’"
Deuteronomy,1,37,"“The LORD was also angry with me because of you. He said to me, ‘Moses, you cannot enter the land, either."
Deuteronomy,1,38,"But your helper, Joshua son of Nun, will go into the land. Encourage Joshua, because he will lead the Israelites to take the land for their own."
Deuteronomy,1,39,"You thought your little children would be taken by your enemies. But those children, who are still too young to know right from wrong, will go into the land. I will give it to them. Your children will take the land for their own."
Deuteronomy,1,40,"But you—you must turn around, take the road to the Red Sea and go back into the desert.’"
Deuteronomy,1,41,"“Then you said, ‘Moses, we sinned against the LORD, but now we will do what the , but now we will do what the LORD our God commanded us before—we will go and fight.’
“Then each of you put on your weapons. You thought it would be easy to go and take the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"But the LORD said to me, ‘Tell the people not to go up there and fight, because I will not be with them. Their enemies will defeat them!’"
Deuteronomy,1,43,"“I spoke to you, but you did not listen. You refused to obey the LORD’s command. You thought you could use your own power, so you went up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,44,The Amorites who lived there came out like a swarm of bees and chased you all the way from Seir to Hormah.
Deuteronomy,1,45,"Then you came back crying to the LORD for help, but the for help, but the LORD refused to listen to you."
Deuteronomy,1,46,So you stayed at Kadesh for such a long time.
Deuteronomy,2,1,“Then we did what the LORD told me to do. We went back into the desert on the road that leads to the Red Sea. We traveled for many days to go around the mountains of Seir.
Deuteronomy,2,2,Then the LORD said to me
Deuteronomy,2,3,‘You have traveled around these mountains long enough. Turn north.
Deuteronomy,2,4,"Tell the people this: You will pass through the land of Seir. This land belongs to your relatives, the descendants of Esau. They will be afraid of you. Be very careful."
Deuteronomy,2,5,"Don’t fight them. I will not give you any of their land—not even a foot of it, because I gave the hill country of Seir to Esau to keep as his own."
Deuteronomy,2,6,You must pay the people of Esau for any food you eat or water you drink there.
Deuteronomy,2,7,Remember that the LORD your God has blessed you in everything you have done. He knows about everything that happened on the trip through this great desert. The your God has blessed you in everything you have done. He knows about everything that happened on the trip through this great desert. The LORD your God has been with you these 40 years. You have always had everything you needed.’
Deuteronomy,2,8,"“So we passed by our relatives, the people of Esau living there in Seir. We left the road that leads from the Jordan Valley to the towns of Elath and Ezion Geber. We turned onto the road that goes to the desert in Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,9,"“The LORD said to me, ‘Don’t bother the Moabites. Don’t start a war against them. I will not give you any of their land. They are the descendants of Lot, and I gave them the city of Ar.’”"
Deuteronomy,2,10,"(In the past, the Emites lived in Ar. They were strong people, and there were many of them. They were very tall, like the Anakites."
Deuteronomy,2,11,"The Anakites were part of the Rephaites. People thought the Emites were also Rephaites, but the people of Moab called them Emites."
Deuteronomy,2,12,"The Horites also lived in Seir in the past. Then Esau’s people destroyed the Horites, took their land, and settled there, just as the Israelites did to the people in the land that the LORD gave them.)"
Deuteronomy,2,13,"“The Lord told me, ‘Now, go to the other side of Zered Valley.’ So we crossed Zered Valley."
Deuteronomy,2,14,"It was 38 years from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until the time we crossed Zered Valley. As the LORD had promised, all the fighting men in our camp from that generation had died."
Deuteronomy,2,15,The LORD had opposed those men until they were all dead and gone from our camp.
Deuteronomy,2,16,“After all the fighting men were dead and gone
Deuteronomy,2,17,the LORD said to me
Deuteronomy,2,18,‘Today you must cross the border at Ar and go into Moab.
Deuteronomy,2,19,"You will be just across from the Ammonites. Don’t bother them or fight with them, because I will not give you their land. They are descendants of Lot, and I have given that land to them.’”"
Deuteronomy,2,20,(That country is also known as the Land of Rephaim. The Rephaites lived there in the past. The people of Ammon called them the Zamzummites.
Deuteronomy,2,21,"There were many Rephaites, and they were very strong and tall like the Anakites. But the LORD helped the Ammonites destroy them. The Ammonites took that land and live there now."
Deuteronomy,2,22,"God did the same thing for Esau’s people. In the past the Horites lived in Seir. But Esau’s people destroyed the Horites, and Esau’s descendants still live there today."
Deuteronomy,2,23,"God did the same thing for some people from Crete. The Avvites lived in the towns around Gaza, but the Cretans destroyed them, took the land, and live there now.)"
Deuteronomy,2,24,"“The Lord told me, ‘Get ready to go across Arnon Valley. I will let you defeat Sihon the Amorite, the king of Heshbon. I will let you take his country. So fight against him and take his land."
Deuteronomy,2,25,"Today I will make all people everywhere afraid of you. They will hear the news about you, and they will be afraid and shake with fear.’"
Deuteronomy,2,26,"“While we were in the desert of Kedemoth, I sent messengers to King Sihon of Heshbon. The messengers offered peace to Sihon. They said"
Deuteronomy,2,27,‘Let us go through your land. We will stay on the road. We will not turn off the road to the right or to the left.
Deuteronomy,2,28,We will pay you in silver for any food we eat or any water we drink. We only want to march through your country.
Deuteronomy,2,29,Let us go through your land until we go across the Jordan River into the land that the LORD our God is giving us. Other people have let us go through their land—the people of Esau living in Seir and the Moabites living in Ar.’
Deuteronomy,2,30,“But King Sihon of Heshbon would not let us pass through his country. The LORD your God had made him very stubborn and ready to fight. The Lord did this so that he could help you defeat King Sihon. And today we know that is what happened.
Deuteronomy,2,31,"“The LORD said to me, ‘I am giving King Sihon and his country to you. Now, go take his land!’"
Deuteronomy,2,32,“Then King Sihon and all his people came out to fight against us at Jahaz.
Deuteronomy,2,33,"But the LORD our God gave him to us. We defeated King Sihon, his sons, and all his people."
Deuteronomy,2,34,"We captured all the cities that belonged to King Sihon at that time. We completely destroyed the people in every city—the men, women, and children. We did not leave anyone alive!"
Deuteronomy,2,35,We took only the cattle and the valuable things from those cities.
Deuteronomy,2,36,We defeated the town of Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Valley and the other town in the middle of that valley. The LORD let us defeat all the cities between the Arnon Valley and Gilead. No city was too strong for us.
Deuteronomy,2,37,But you did not go near the land that belongs to the people of Ammon. You did not go near the shores of the Jabbok River or the cities of the hill country. You did not go near any place that the LORD our God would not let us have.
Deuteronomy,3,1,“We turned and went on the road to Bashan. King Og of Bashan and all his men came out to fight against us at Edrei.
Deuteronomy,3,2,"The LORD said to me, ‘Don’t be afraid of Og. I have decided to give him to you. I will give you all his men and his land. You will defeat him just as you defeated Sihon, the Amorite king who ruled in Heshbon.’"
Deuteronomy,3,3,“So the LORD our God let us defeat King Og of Bashan. We destroyed him and all his men. Not one of them was left.
Deuteronomy,3,4,"Then we took all the cities that belonged to Og at that time. We took all the cities from Og’s people—60 cities in the area of Argob, Og’s kingdom in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,5,"All these cities were very strong. They had high walls, gates, and strong bars on the gates. There were also many towns that did not have walls."
Deuteronomy,3,6,"We destroyed them just as we destroyed the cities of King Sihon of Heshbon. We completely destroyed every city and all the people in them, even the women and the babies."
Deuteronomy,3,7,But we kept all the cattle and the valuable things from the cities for ourselves.
Deuteronomy,3,8,"“In that way we took the land from the two Amorite kings. We took that land on the east side of the Jordan River, from Arnon Valley to Mount Hermon."
Deuteronomy,3,9,"(The people from Sidon call Mount Hermon, Sirion, but the Amorites called it Senir.)"
Deuteronomy,3,10,"We took all the cities in the high plain and all of Gilead. We took all of Bashan, all the way to Salecah and Edrei. Salecah and Edrei were cities of Og’s kingdom of Bashan.”"
Deuteronomy,3,11,"(Og was the king of Bashan. He was one of the few Rephaites still alive. His bed was made from iron, and it was over 13 feet long and 6 feet wide. The bed is still in the city of Rabbah, where the Ammonites live.)"
Deuteronomy,3,12,“So we took that land to be ours. I gave part of this land to the tribes of Reuben and Gad. I gave them the land from Aroer in the Arnon Valley to the hill country of Gilead with the cities in it. They got half of the hill country of Gilead.
Deuteronomy,3,13,"I gave the other half of Gilead and the whole area of Bashan to half the tribe of Manasseh.”
(Bashan was Og’s kingdom. Part of Bashan was called Argob. It was also called the Land of Rephaim."
Deuteronomy,3,14,"Jair, from the tribe of Manasseh, took the whole area of Argob. That area went all the way to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites. It was named for Jair, and even today, people call Bashan the Towns of Jair.)"
Deuteronomy,3,15,“I gave Gilead to Makir.
Deuteronomy,3,16,"And to the tribe of Reuben and the tribe of Gad, I gave the land that begins at Gilead and goes from the Arnon Valley to the Jabbok River. The middle of the valley is one border. The Jabbok River is the border for the Ammonites."
Deuteronomy,3,17,"The Jordan River near the desert is their western border. Lake Galilee is north of this area and the Dead Sea is to the south. It is at the bottom of the cliffs of Pisgah, which are to the east."
Deuteronomy,3,18,“At that time I gave those tribes this command: ‘The LORD your God has given you the land on this side of the Jordan River to live in. But now your fighting men must take their weapons and lead the other Israelite tribes across the river.
Deuteronomy,3,19,"Your wives, your little children, and your cattle (I know you have many cattle) will stay here in the cities I have given you."
Deuteronomy,3,20,"But you must help your Israelite relatives until they take the land that the LORD is giving them on the other side of the Jordan River. Help them until the is giving them on the other side of the Jordan River. Help them until the LORD gives them peace there, just as he did for you here. Then you may come back to this land that I have given you.’"
Deuteronomy,3,21,"“Then I told Joshua, ‘You have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. The your God has done to these two kings. The LORD will do the same thing to all the kingdoms you will enter."
Deuteronomy,3,22,"Don’t fear the kings of these lands, because the LORD your God will fight for you.’"
Deuteronomy,3,23,“Then I begged the LORD to do something special for me. I said
Deuteronomy,3,24,"‘Lord GOD, I am your servant. I know that you have shown me only a small part of the wonderful and powerful things you will do. There is no god in heaven or earth that can do the great and powerful things you have done."
Deuteronomy,3,25,Please let me go across the Jordan River and see the good land on the other side. Let me see the beautiful hill country and Lebanon.’
Deuteronomy,3,26,"“But the LORD was angry with me because of you and refused to listen to me. The was angry with me because of you and refused to listen to me. The LORD said to me, ‘That’s enough! Don’t say another word about this."
Deuteronomy,3,27,"Go up to the top of Mount Pisgah. Look to the west, to the north, to the south, and to the east. You may see these things with your eyes, but you can never go across the Jordan River."
Deuteronomy,3,28,"You must give instructions to Joshua. Encourage him. Make him strong, because Joshua must lead the people across the Jordan River. You can see the land, but Joshua will lead them into that land. He will help them take the land and live in it.’"
Deuteronomy,3,29,“So we stayed in the valley across from Beth Peor.
Deuteronomy,4,1,"“Now, Israel, listen to the laws and to the commands that I teach you. Obey them and you will live. Then you can go in and take the land that the LORD, the God of your ancestors, is giving you."
Deuteronomy,4,2,You must not add to what I command you. And you must not take anything away. You must obey the commands of the LORD your God that I have given you.
Deuteronomy,4,3,“You have seen what the LORD did at Baal Peor. The did at Baal Peor. The LORD your God destroyed all your people who followed the false god Baal at that place.
Deuteronomy,4,4,But all of you who stayed with the LORD your God are alive today.
Deuteronomy,4,5,“I taught you the laws and rules that the LORD my God commanded me. I did this so you could obey them in the land you are ready to enter and take for your own.
Deuteronomy,4,6,"Obey these laws carefully. This will show the people of the other nations that you are wise and sensible. They will hear about these laws and say, ‘Truly, the people of this great nation are wise and sensible.’"
Deuteronomy,4,7,“The LORD our God is near when we ask him to help us. No other nation has a god like that!
Deuteronomy,4,8,And no other nation is great enough to have laws and rules as good as the teachings I give you today.
Deuteronomy,4,9,But you must be careful! Be sure that as long as you live you never forget what you have seen. You must teach these things to your children and grandchildren.
Deuteronomy,4,10,"Remember the day you stood before the LORD your God at Mount Horeb. The your God at Mount Horeb. The LORD said to me, ‘Gather the people together to listen to what I have to say. Then they will learn to respect me as long as they live on earth. And they will teach these things to their children.’"
Deuteronomy,4,11,You came near and stood at the bottom of the mountain. The mountain burned with fire that reached up to the sky. There were thick black clouds and darkness.
Deuteronomy,4,12,"Then the LORD spoke to you from the fire. You heard the sound of someone speaking, but you did not see any form. There was only a voice."
Deuteronomy,4,13,"The Lord told you about his agreement, which he commanded you to obey. He told you about the Ten Commandments, which he wrote on two stone tablets."
Deuteronomy,4,14,At that time the LORD also commanded me to teach you the other laws and rules that you must follow in the land you are going to take and live in.
Deuteronomy,4,15,"“On the day the LORD spoke to you from the fire at Mount Horeb, you did not see him—there was no shape for God."
Deuteronomy,4,16,So be careful! Don’t sin and destroy yourselves by making false gods or statues in the shape of any living thing. Don’t make an idol that looks like a man or a woman
Deuteronomy,4,17,"or like an animal on the earth, or like a bird that flies in the sky."
Deuteronomy,4,18,And don’t make an idol that looks like anything that crawls on the ground or like a fish in the sea.
Deuteronomy,4,19,"And be careful when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon, and the stars—all the many things in the sky. Be careful that you are not tempted to worship and serve them. The LORD your God lets the other people in the world do this."
Deuteronomy,4,20,But the LORD brought you out of Egypt to make you his own special people. He saved you from Egypt. It was as if he pulled you from a hot furnace. And now you are his people.
Deuteronomy,4,21,“The LORD was angry with me because of you. He swore that I could not go across the Jordan River into the good land that the was angry with me because of you. He swore that I could not go across the Jordan River into the good land that the LORD your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy,4,22,"So I must die here in this land. I cannot go across the Jordan River, but you will soon go across it and take that good land and live there."
Deuteronomy,4,23,You must be careful not to forget the agreement that the LORD your God made with you. You must obey the your God made with you. You must obey the LORD’s command. Don’t make any idols in any form
Deuteronomy,4,24,because the LORD your God hates for his people to worship other gods. And he can be like a fire that destroys!
Deuteronomy,4,25,"“You will live in the country a long time. You will have children and grandchildren there. After all that time, be sure that you do not then ruin your lives by making any kind of idol! That is something the LORD your God considers evil, and it would make him very angry!"
Deuteronomy,4,26,"So I am warning you now. Heaven and earth are my witnesses! If you do such an evil thing, you will quickly be destroyed! You are crossing the Jordan River now to take that land. But if you make any idols, you will not live there very long. No, you will be destroyed completely!"
Deuteronomy,4,27,The LORD will scatter you among the nations. And only a few of you will be left alive to go to the countries where the will scatter you among the nations. And only a few of you will be left alive to go to the countries where the LORD will send you.
Deuteronomy,4,28,There you will serve gods made by men—things made of wood and stone that cannot see or hear or eat or smell!
Deuteronomy,4,29,"But there in these other lands you will look for the LORD your God. And if you look for him with all your heart and soul, you will find him."
Deuteronomy,4,30,When you are in trouble—when all these things happen to you—then you will come back to the LORD your God and obey him.
Deuteronomy,4,31,The LORD your God is a merciful God! He will not leave you there or destroy you completely. He will not forget the agreement that he made with your ancestors.
Deuteronomy,4,32,“Has anything this great ever happened before? Never! Look at the past. Think about everything that happened before you were born. Go all the way back to the time when God made people on the earth. Look at everything that has happened anywhere in the world. Has anyone ever heard about anything as great as this? No!
Deuteronomy,4,33,"You people heard God speaking to you from a fire, and you are still alive. Has that ever happened to anyone else? No!"
Deuteronomy,4,34,Has any other god ever tried to go and take a people for himself from inside another nation? No! But you yourselves have seen everything that the LORD your God did for you. He showed you his power and strength. You saw the troubles that tested the people. You saw miracles and wonders. You saw war and the terrible things that happened.
Deuteronomy,4,35,The LORD showed you all this so that you would know that he is God. There is no other god like him.
Deuteronomy,4,36,"He let you hear his voice from heaven so that he could teach you a lesson. On earth he let you see his great fire, and he spoke to you from it."
Deuteronomy,4,37,"“He loved your ancestors. That is why he chose you, their descendants. And that is why he brought you out of Egypt. He was with you and brought you out with his great power."
Deuteronomy,4,38,"When you moved forward, he forced out nations that were greater and more powerful than you. And he led you into their land. He gave you their land to live in, as he is still doing today."
Deuteronomy,4,39,“So today you must remember and accept that the LORD is God. He is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other god!
Deuteronomy,4,40,And you must obey his laws and commands that I give you today. Then everything will go well with you and your children who live after you. And you will live a long time in the land the LORD your God is giving you—it will be yours forever.”
Deuteronomy,4,41,Then Moses chose three cities on the east side of the Jordan River.
Deuteronomy,4,42,Any person who killed someone by accident and not out of hate could run away to one of these three cities and not be put to death.
Deuteronomy,4,43,"The three cities that Moses chose were Bezer in the high plains for the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead for the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan for the tribe of Manasseh."
Deuteronomy,4,44,Moses gave God’s law to the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,4,45,"Moses gave these teachings, laws, and rules to the people after they came out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,4,46,"He gave them these laws while they were on the east side of the Jordan River, in the valley across from Beth Peor. They were in the land of Sihon, the Amorite king who lived at Heshbon. Moses and the Israelites had defeated Sihon when they came out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,4,47,They took Sihon’s land to keep. They also took the land of King Og of Bashan. These two Amorite kings lived on the east side of the Jordan River.
Deuteronomy,4,48,"This land goes from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Valley all the way to Mount Sirion, that is, Mount Hermon."
Deuteronomy,4,49,"This land also included the whole Jordan Valley on the east side of the Jordan River. To the south, this land reached to the Dead Sea. To the east, it reached to the foot of Mount Pisgah."
Deuteronomy,5,1,"Moses called together all the Israelites and said to them, “Israelites, listen to the laws and rules that I tell you today. Learn these laws and be sure to obey them."
Deuteronomy,5,2,The LORD our God made an agreement with us at Mount Horeb.
Deuteronomy,5,3,"The LORD did not make this agreement with our ancestors, but with us—yes, with all of us who are alive here today."
Deuteronomy,5,4,The LORD spoke with you face to face at that mountain. He spoke to you from the fire.
Deuteronomy,5,5,But you were afraid of the fire. And you did not go up the mountain. So I stood between you and the LORD to tell you what the to tell you what the LORD said. He said
Deuteronomy,5,6,"‘I am the LORD your God. I am the one who freed you from Egypt, where you were slaves."
Deuteronomy,5,7,‘You must not worship any other gods except me.
Deuteronomy,5,8,‘You must not make any idols. Don’t make any statues or pictures of anything up in the sky or of anything on the earth or of anything down in the water.
Deuteronomy,5,9,"Don’t worship or serve idols of any kind, because I am the LORD your God. I hate for my people to worship other gods. People who sin against me become my enemies. And I will punish them, and their children, their grandchildren, and even their great-grandchildren."
Deuteronomy,5,10,But I will be very kind to people who love me and obey my commands. I will be kind to their families for thousands of generations!
Deuteronomy,5,11,"‘You must not use the name of the LORD your God to make empty promises. If you do, the your God to make empty promises. If you do, the LORD will not let you go unpunished."
Deuteronomy,5,12,‘You must keep the Sabbath a special day like the LORD your God commanded.
Deuteronomy,5,13,Work six days a week and do your job
Deuteronomy,5,14,"but the seventh day is a day of rest in honor of the LORD your God. So on that day no one should work—not you, your sons and daughters, foreigners living in your cities or your men and women slaves. Not even your cattle, donkeys, and other animals should do any work! Your slaves should be able to rest just as you do."
Deuteronomy,5,15,Don’t forget that you were slaves in the land of Egypt. The LORD your God brought you out of Egypt with his great power and made you free. That is why the your God brought you out of Egypt with his great power and made you free. That is why the LORD your God commands you to always make the Sabbath a special day.
Deuteronomy,5,16,"‘You must honor your father and your mother. The LORD your God has commanded you to do this. If you follow this command, you will live a long time, and everything will go well for you in the land that the your God has commanded you to do this. If you follow this command, you will live a long time, and everything will go well for you in the land that the LORD your God gives you."
Deuteronomy,5,17,‘You must not murder anyone.
Deuteronomy,5,18,‘You must not commit the sin of adultery.
Deuteronomy,5,19,‘You must not steal.

Deuteronomy,12,3,You must smash their altars and break their memorial stones into pieces. You must burn their Asherah poles and cut down the statues of their gods. Wipe out everything that would remind you of those gods.
Deuteronomy,12,4,“You must not worship the LORD your God in the same way these people worship their gods.
Deuteronomy,12,5,The LORD your God will choose a special place among your tribes. That will be the home for his name. You must go to that place to worship him.
Deuteronomy,12,6,"There you must bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, one-tenth of your crops and animals, your special gifts, any gifts you promised to him, any special gift you want to give, and the first animals born in your herds and flocks."
Deuteronomy,12,7,"You and your families will eat together at that place, and the LORD your God will be there with you. You will enjoy sharing the things you worked for there. You will remember that the your God will be there with you. You will enjoy sharing the things you worked for there. You will remember that the LORD your God blessed you and gave you these good things."
Deuteronomy,12,8,“You must not continue to worship the way we have been worshiping. Until now each of us has been worshiping God any way we wanted.
Deuteronomy,12,9,This is because we have not yet entered the peaceful land that the LORD your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy,12,10,"But you will go across the Jordan River and live in the land that the LORD your God is giving you. There he will give you rest from all your enemies, and you will be safe."
Deuteronomy,12,11,"Then the LORD your God will choose a place that will be the home for his name. You must bring everything I command you to that place. Bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, one-tenth of your crops and animals, your special gifts, and any gifts that you promised to give to the your God will choose a place that will be the home for his name. You must bring everything I command you to that place. Bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, one-tenth of your crops and animals, your special gifts, and any gifts that you promised to give to the LORD."
Deuteronomy,12,12,"Come to that place with all your people—your children, all your servants, and the Levites living in your towns. (These Levites will not have a share of the land for their own.) Enjoy yourselves together there with the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,12,13,Be sure you don’t offer your burnt offerings in just any place you see.
Deuteronomy,12,14,The LORD will choose his special place among your tribes. Offer your burnt offerings and do everything else I told you only in that place.
Deuteronomy,12,15,"“Whenever you want to eat meat, you can enjoy that blessing from the LORD your God wherever you live. You can butcher the animal just as you do gazelles and deer, and anyone, clean or unclean, can eat it."
Deuteronomy,12,16,But you must not eat the blood. You must pour the blood on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,12,17,"“Also, the things you are offering to God must not be eaten where you live. These include the part of your grain that belongs to God, the part of your new wine and oil that belongs to God, the first animals born in your herd or flock, any gift that you promised to God, any special gifts you want to give, or any other gifts for God."
Deuteronomy,12,18,"You must eat these offerings only in his presence at the special place that the LORD your God will choose. You must go there and eat together with your sons, your daughters, all your servants, and the Levites living in your towns. Enjoy yourselves there with the your God will choose. You must go there and eat together with your sons, your daughters, all your servants, and the Levites living in your towns. Enjoy yourselves there with the LORD your God. Enjoy what you have worked for."
Deuteronomy,12,19,But be sure that you always share these meals with the Levites. Do this as long as you live in your land.
Deuteronomy,12,20,"“The LORD your God promised to make your country larger. When he does this, you might live too far from the place the your God promised to make your country larger. When he does this, you might live too far from the place the LORD your God chooses to be the home for his name. If it is too far, and you are hungry for meat, you may eat any meat you have. You may kill any animal from the herd or flock that he has given you. Do this the way I have commanded you. You may eat this meat there where you live any time you want."
Deuteronomy,12,21,"“The LORD your God promised to make your country larger. When he does this, you might live too far from the place the your God promised to make your country larger. When he does this, you might live too far from the place the LORD your God chooses to be the home for his name. If it is too far, and you are hungry for meat, you may eat any meat you have. You may kill any animal from the herd or flock that he has given you. Do this the way I have commanded you. You may eat this meat there where you live any time you want."
Deuteronomy,12,22,You may eat this meat the same as you would eat gazelle or deer meat. Anyone can do this—people who are clean and people who are unclean.
Deuteronomy,12,23,"But be especially careful not to eat the blood, because the life is in the blood. You must not eat meat that still has its life in it."
Deuteronomy,12,24,Don’t eat the blood. Pour it out like water onto the ground.
Deuteronomy,12,25,"So don’t eat blood. You must do what the LORD says is right, and good things will happen to you and to your descendants."
Deuteronomy,12,26,"“If you decide to give something special to God, you must go to the special place that the LORD your God will choose. And if you make a special promise, you must go to that place to give that gift to God."
Deuteronomy,12,27,"You must offer your burnt offerings in that place. Offer the meat and the blood of your burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD your God. For your other sacrifices, you must pour the blood on the altar of the your God. For your other sacrifices, you must pour the blood on the altar of the LORD your God. Then you may eat the meat."
Deuteronomy,12,28,Carefully obey all the commands that I give you. When you do what is good and right—what pleases the LORD your God—then everything will go well for you and for your descendants forever.
Deuteronomy,12,29,"“You are going to take your land from other people. The LORD your God will destroy these people for you. You will force them out of that land, and then you will live there."
Deuteronomy,12,30,"But be careful that you don’t fall into the same trap they did! Don’t go to their false gods for help. Don’t say to yourself, ‘They worshiped these gods, so I will worship them too.’"
Deuteronomy,12,31,Don’t do that to the LORD your God! These people do all kinds of bad things that the your God! These people do all kinds of bad things that the LORD hates. They even burn their children as sacrifices to their gods!
Deuteronomy,12,32,"“You must be careful to do everything I command you. Don’t add anything to what I tell you, and don’t take anything away."
Deuteronomy,13,1,“A prophet or someone who explains dreams might come to you and tell you that they will show you a sign or a miracle.
Deuteronomy,13,2,"And the sign or miracle they told you about might come true. Then they might ask you to follow other gods (gods you don’t know) and say to you, ‘Let’s serve these gods!’"
Deuteronomy,13,3,"Don’t listen to them, because the LORD your God is testing you. He wants to know if you love him with all your heart and all your soul."
Deuteronomy,13,4,"You must follow the LORD your God. Respect him. Obey his commands and do what he tells you. Serve the your God. Respect him. Obey his commands and do what he tells you. Serve the LORD your God, and never leave him."
Deuteronomy,13,5,"Also, you must kill that prophet or person who explains dreams, because they told you to turn against the LORD your God. And it was the your God. And it was the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, where you were slaves. They tried to pull you away from the life he commanded you to live, so you must kill them to remove this evil from your people."
Deuteronomy,13,6,"“Someone close to you might secretly persuade you to worship other gods. It might be your own brother, your son, your daughter, the wife you love, or your closest friend. They might say, ‘Let’s go and serve other gods.’ (These are gods that you and your ancestors never knew."
Deuteronomy,13,7,"They are the gods of the people who live in the other lands around you, some near and some far away.)"
Deuteronomy,13,8,You must not agree with them. Don’t listen to them or feel sorry for them. Don’t let them go free or protect them.
Deuteronomy,13,9,"No, you must kill them with stones. You be the first one to pick up stones and throw at them. Then everyone must throw stones to kill them, because they tried to pull you away from the LORD your God. And it was the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt, where you were slaves."
Deuteronomy,13,10,"No, you must kill them with stones. You be the first one to pick up stones and throw at them. Then everyone must throw stones to kill them, because they tried to pull you away from the LORD your God. And it was the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt, where you were slaves."
Deuteronomy,13,11,Then all the Israelites will hear about it and be afraid. And they will not do those evil things anymore.
Deuteronomy,13,12,“The LORD your God has given you cities to live in. Sometimes you might hear some bad news about one of these cities. You might hear that
Deuteronomy,13,13,"some troublemakers from your own nation are persuading the people of their city to do bad things. They might say to the people of their city, ‘Let’s go and serve other gods.’ (These gods would be gods that you never knew before.)"
Deuteronomy,13,14,"If you hear this kind of news, you must do all you can to learn if it is true. If you learn that it is true, if you prove that such a terrible thing really did happen"
Deuteronomy,13,15,then you must kill all the people of that city and their animals too. You must destroy that city completely.
Deuteronomy,13,16,"You must gather up everything of value and take it to the center of the city. Burn the whole city and everything in it as a burnt offering to the LORD your God. You must turn that city into an empty pile of rocks forever, and that city must never be rebuilt."
Deuteronomy,13,17,"Everything in that city must be destroyed as an offering to God. So you must not keep any of the things for yourselves. If you follow this command, the LORD will stop being so angry with you. He will be kind to you. He will feel sorry for you. He will let your nation grow larger, as he promised your ancestors."
Deuteronomy,13,18,This will happen if you listen to the LORD your God—if you obey all his commands that I give you today. You must do what the your God—if you obey all his commands that I give you today. You must do what the LORD your God says is right.
Deuteronomy,14,1,"“You are the children of the LORD your God. When someone dies, you must not cut yourselves or shave your heads to show your sadness."
Deuteronomy,14,2,"This is because you are different from other people. You belong to the LORD your God. From all the people in the world, the your God. From all the people in the world, the LORD chose you to be his own special people."
Deuteronomy,14,3,“Don’t eat anything that the Lord hates.
Deuteronomy,14,4,"You may eat these animals: cattle, sheep, goats"
Deuteronomy,14,5,"deer, gazelles, roe deer, wild sheep, wild goats, antelopes, and mountain sheep."
Deuteronomy,14,6,You may eat any animal that has hooves divided into two parts and that chews the cud.
Deuteronomy,14,7,"But don’t eat camels, rabbits, or rock badgers. These animals chew the cud, but they don’t have split hooves. So these animals are not a clean food for you."
Deuteronomy,14,8,"And you must not eat pigs. Their hooves are divided, but they don’t chew the cud. So pigs are not a clean food for you. Don’t eat any meat from pigs. Don’t even touch a pig’s dead body."
Deuteronomy,14,9,“You may eat any kind of fish that has fins and scales.
Deuteronomy,14,10,But don’t eat anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales. It is not a clean food for you.
Deuteronomy,14,11,“You may eat any clean bird.
Deuteronomy,14,12,"But don’t eat any of these birds: eagles, vultures, buzzards"
Deuteronomy,14,13,"red kites, falcons, any kind of kite"
Deuteronomy,14,14,any kind of raven
Deuteronomy,14,15,"horned owls, screech owls, sea gulls, any kind of hawk"
Deuteronomy,14,16,"little owls, great owls, white owls"
Deuteronomy,14,17,"desert owls, ospreys, cormorants"
Deuteronomy,14,18,"storks, any kind of heron, hoopoes, or bats."
Deuteronomy,14,19,"“All insects with wings are unclean, so don’t eat them."
Deuteronomy,14,20,But you may eat any clean bird.
Deuteronomy,14,21,"“Don’t eat any animal that has died by itself. You may give the dead animal to the foreigner in your town, and he can eat it. Or you may sell the dead animal to a foreigner. But you yourselves must not eat the dead animal, because you belong to the LORD your God. You are his special people.
“Don’t cook a baby goat in its mother’s milk."
Deuteronomy,14,22,“Every year you must be sure to save one-tenth of all the crops that grow in your fields.
Deuteronomy,14,23,"Then you must go to the place the Lord chooses to be the home for his name. You will go there to be with the LORD your God. At that place you will eat the tenth of your crops—one-tenth of your grain, your new wine, your oil, and the first animals born in your herds and flocks. In this way you will always remember to respect the your God. At that place you will eat the tenth of your crops—one-tenth of your grain, your new wine, your oil, and the first animals born in your herds and flocks. In this way you will always remember to respect the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,14,24,But that place might be too far for you to travel to. Maybe you will not be able to carry one-tenth of all the crops that the LORD has blessed you with. If that happens
Deuteronomy,14,25,sell that part of your crops and take the money with you to the special place the LORD has chosen.
Deuteronomy,14,26,"Use the money to buy anything you want—cattle, sheep, wine or beer or any other food. Then you and your family should eat and enjoy yourselves there in that place with the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,14,27,But don’t forget the Levites living in your town. Share your food with them because they don’t have a share of the land like you have.
Deuteronomy,14,28,"“At the end of every three years, you must gather one-tenth of your harvest for that year. Store this food in your towns."
Deuteronomy,14,29,"Keep this food for the Levites, because they don’t have any land of their own. Also keep this food for the foreigners, orphans, and widows who live in your towns. This will provide enough for them to come and eat all they want. If you do this, the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do."
Deuteronomy,15,1,"“At the end of every seven years, you must cancel debts."
Deuteronomy,15,2,"This is the way you must do this: Everyone who has lent money to another Israelite must cancel the debt. He should not ask a fellow Israelite to repay the debt, because the LORD said to cancel debts during that year."
Deuteronomy,15,3,"You may require a foreigner to repay you, but you must cancel any debt another Israelite owes you."
Deuteronomy,15,4,"There should not be any poor people in your country, because the LORD your God is giving you this land. And the your God is giving you this land. And the LORD will greatly bless you."
Deuteronomy,15,5,But this will happen only if you obey the LORD your God. You must be careful to obey every command that I have told you today.
Deuteronomy,15,6,"Then the LORD your God will bless you, as he promised. And you will have enough money to make loans to many nations. But you will not need to borrow from anyone. You will rule over many nations. But none of these nations will rule over you."
Deuteronomy,15,7,"“When you are living in the land the LORD your God is giving you, there might be some poor people living among you. You must not be selfish. You must not refuse to give help to them."
Deuteronomy,15,8,You must be willing to share with them. You must lend them whatever they need.
Deuteronomy,15,9,"“Don’t ever refuse to help someone simply because the seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near. Don’t let an evil thought like that enter your mind. You must never have bad thoughts about someone who needs help. You must not refuse to help them. If you don’t help the poor, they might complain to the LORD, and he will judge you guilty of sin."
Deuteronomy,15,10,"“So be sure to give to the poor. Don’t hesitate to give to them, because the LORD your God will bless you for doing this good thing. He will bless you in all your work and in everything you do."
Deuteronomy,15,11,There will always be poor people in the land. That is why I command you to be ready to help your brother or sister. Give to the poor in your land who need help.
Deuteronomy,15,12,"“You might buy a Hebrew man or woman to serve you as a slave. You may keep that person as a slave for six years. But in the seventh year, you must let that person go free."
Deuteronomy,15,13,"But when you let your slave go free, don’t send him away with nothing."
Deuteronomy,15,14,"You must give him some of your animals, grain, and wine. The LORD your God blessed you and gave you plenty of good things. In the same way you must give plenty of good things to your slave."
Deuteronomy,15,15,"Remember, you were slaves in Egypt. And the LORD your God set you free. So that is why I am giving you this command today."
Deuteronomy,15,16,"“But one of your slaves might say to you, ‘I will not leave you.’ He might say this because he loves you and your family and because he has a good life with you."
Deuteronomy,15,17,Make this servant put his ear against your door and use a sharp tool to make a hole in his ear. This will show that he is your slave forever. You must do this even to the women slaves who want to stay with you.
Deuteronomy,15,18,"“Don’t regret letting your slave go free. Remember, he served you six years for half of what you would have paid a hired worker. The LORD your God will bless you in everything you do."
Deuteronomy,15,19,“All the first male animals born in your herd and flock are special. You must give them to the LORD. Don’t use any of these animals for your work and don’t cut wool from any of these sheep.
Deuteronomy,15,20,"Every year you must take these animals to the place the LORD your God will choose. There with the your God will choose. There with the LORD, you and your family will eat these animals."
Deuteronomy,15,21,“But if an animal has something wrong with it—if it is crippled or blind or has something else wrong with it—then you must not sacrifice that animal to the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy,15,22,But you may eat the meat from that animal at home. Anyone may eat it—people who are clean and people who are unclean. The rules for eating this meat are the same as the rules for eating gazelles and deer.
Deuteronomy,15,23,But you must not eat the blood from the animal. You must pour the blood out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,16,1,"“Remember, in the month of Abib you must celebrate Passover to honor the LORD your God. It was that night in Abib when the your God. It was that night in Abib when the LORD your God brought you out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,16,2,You must go to the place the LORD your God will choose to be the home for his name. There you must offer the Passover sacrifice to honor the your God will choose to be the home for his name. There you must offer the Passover sacrifice to honor the LORD. You must offer the cattle and goats.
Deuteronomy,16,3,Don’t eat bread that has yeast in it with this sacrifice. You must eat unleavened bread for seven days. This bread is called ‘Bread of Trouble.’ It will help you remember the troubles you had in Egypt. Remember how quickly you had to leave that country. You must remember that day as long as you live.
Deuteronomy,16,4,There must be no yeast in anyone’s house anywhere in the country for seven days. And all the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day must be eaten before morning.
Deuteronomy,16,5,“You must not sacrifice the Passover animal in any of the towns that the LORD your God gives you.
Deuteronomy,16,6,You must sacrifice the Passover animal only at the place that the LORD your God will choose to be the home for his name. There you must sacrifice the Passover animal in the evening when the sun goes down. This is the festival when you remember that God brought you out of Egypt.
Deuteronomy,16,7,You must cook the meal and eat it at the place the LORD your God will choose. The next morning you may go back home.
Deuteronomy,16,8,You must eat unleavened bread six days. On the seventh day you must not do any work. On this day the people will come together for a special meeting to honor the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy,16,9,“You must count seven weeks from the time you begin to harvest the grain.
Deuteronomy,16,10,Then celebrate the Festival of Harvest for the LORD your God. Do this by bringing him some special gift you want to bring. Decide how much to give by thinking about how much the your God. Do this by bringing him some special gift you want to bring. Decide how much to give by thinking about how much the LORD your God has blessed you.
Deuteronomy,16,11,"Go to the place the LORD will choose to be the home for his name. You and your people should enjoy yourselves together there with the will choose to be the home for his name. You and your people should enjoy yourselves together there with the LORD your God. Take all your people with you—your sons, your daughters, and all your servants. And take the Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows living in your towns."
Deuteronomy,16,12,"Remember, you were slaves in Egypt. So be sure to obey these laws."
Deuteronomy,16,13,"“Seven days after you have gathered your harvest in from your threshing floor and from your winepress, you should celebrate the Festival of Shelters."
Deuteronomy,16,14,"Enjoy yourselves at this festival—you, your sons, your daughters, all your servants, and the Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows living in your towns."
Deuteronomy,16,15,"Celebrate this festival for seven days at the special place the LORD will choose. Do this to honor the will choose. Do this to honor the LORD your God. The your God. The LORD your God blessed your harvest and all the work you did, so be very happy!"
Deuteronomy,16,16,"“Three times a year all your men must come to meet with the LORD your God at the special place he will choose. They must come for the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Harvest, and the Festival of Shelters. Everyone who comes to meet with the your God at the special place he will choose. They must come for the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Harvest, and the Festival of Shelters. Everyone who comes to meet with the LORD must bring a gift."
Deuteronomy,16,17,Each man should give as much as he can. He should decide how much to give by thinking about how much the LORD your God has given him.
Deuteronomy,16,18,“Choose men to be judges and officers in every town that the LORD your God gives you. Every tribe must do this. And these men must be fair in judging the people.
Deuteronomy,16,19,You must always be fair. You must not favor some people over other people. You must not take money to change your mind in judgment. Money blinds the eyes of wise people and changes what a good person will say.
Deuteronomy,16,20,Goodness and Fairness! You must try very hard to be good and fair all the time. Then you will live and keep the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy,16,21,"“When you set up an altar for the LORD your God, you must not place beside the altar any of the wooden poles that honor the goddess Asherah."
Deuteronomy,16,22,You must not set up special stones for worshiping false gods. The LORD your God hates them.
Deuteronomy,17,1,“You must not sacrifice to the LORD your God an ox or sheep that has anything wrong with it. The your God an ox or sheep that has anything wrong with it. The LORD your God would hate that.
Deuteronomy,17,2,“You might hear about an evil thing that happens in one of the cities that the LORD your God is giving you. You might hear that a man or woman in your group has sinned against the your God is giving you. You might hear that a man or woman in your group has sinned against the LORD your God. You might hear that they have broken his agreement or
Deuteronomy,17,3,"that they have worshiped other gods or maybe the sun, the moon or the stars. I never told you to do that!"
Deuteronomy,17,4,"If you hear bad news like this, you must check it carefully. You must learn if it is true that this terrible thing has really happened in Israel. If you prove that it is true"
Deuteronomy,17,5,you must punish the person who did this evil thing. You must take that man or woman out to a public place near the city gates and kill them with stones.
Deuteronomy,17,6,"But no one should be punished with death if only one witness says that person did that evil thing. But if two or three witnesses say it is true, the person must be killed."
Deuteronomy,17,7,The witnesses must throw the first stones to kill that person. Then the other people should throw stones to finish killing that person. In this way you will remove this evil from your group.
Deuteronomy,17,8,"“There might be some problems that are too hard for your courts to judge. It might be a murder case or an argument between two people. Or it might be a fight in which someone was hurt. When these cases are argued in your towns, your judges there might not be able to decide what is right. Then you must go to the special place that the LORD your God will choose."
Deuteronomy,17,9,You must go to the priests who are Levites and to the judge on duty at that time. They will decide what to do about that problem.
Deuteronomy,17,10,There at the LORD’s special place they will tell you their decision. You must do whatever they say. Be sure to do everything they tell you to do.
Deuteronomy,17,11,You must accept their decision and follow their instructions exactly—don’t change anything!
Deuteronomy,17,12,“You must punish anyone who refuses to obey the judge or the priest who is there at that time serving the LORD your God. That person must die. You must remove this evil person from Israel.
Deuteronomy,17,13,All the people will hear about this punishment and be afraid. Then they will not be stubborn anymore.
Deuteronomy,17,14,"“You will enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you. You will take that land and live in it. Then you will say, ‘We will put a king over us, like all the nations around us.’"
Deuteronomy,17,15,"When that happens, you must be sure to choose the king that the LORD your God chooses. The king over you must be one of your own people. You must not make a foreigner your king."
Deuteronomy,17,16,"The king must not get more and more horses for himself. And he must not send people to Egypt to get more horses, because the LORD has told you, ‘You must never go back that way.’"
Deuteronomy,17,17,"Also, the king must not have too many wives, because that will make him turn away from the Lord. And he must not make himself rich with silver and gold."
Deuteronomy,17,18,"“When the king begins to rule, he must write a copy of the law for himself in a book. He must make that copy from the books that the priests from the tribe of Levi keep."
Deuteronomy,17,19,"He must keep that book with him and read from it all his life, because he must learn to respect the LORD his God. He must learn to completely obey everything the law commands."
Deuteronomy,17,20,"Then the king will not think that he is better than any of his own people. He will not turn away from the law, but he will follow it exactly. Then he and his descendants will rule the kingdom of Israel a long time."
Deuteronomy,18,1,“The tribe of Levi will not get any share of land in Israel. The priests come from that tribe and they will eat the special sacrifices that are offered as gifts to the LORD. That is the share for the people from the tribe of Levi.
Deuteronomy,18,2,"The tribe of Levi will not get any share of land like the other tribes. Their share is the LORD himself, as he said to them."
Deuteronomy,18,3,"“When you kill one of your sheep or cattle for a sacrifice, you must give the priests these parts: the shoulder, both cheeks, and the stomach."
Deuteronomy,18,4,"You must give the priests the first part of your harvest. You must give them the first part of your grain, your new wine, and your oil. You must give the Levites the first wool cut from your sheep."
Deuteronomy,18,5,This is because the LORD your God looked at all your tribes and chose Levi and his descendants to serve him as priests forever.
Deuteronomy,18,6,“Any Levite living in any town anywhere in Israel may leave his home and come to the LORD’s special place. He may do this anytime he wants.
Deuteronomy,18,7,"And this Levite may serve in the name of the LORD his God, the same as all his brother Levites who are on duty before the his God, the same as all his brother Levites who are on duty before the LORD."
Deuteronomy,18,8,"And that Levite will get an equal share with the other Levites, in addition to the share his family normally gets."
Deuteronomy,18,9,"“When you come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you, don’t learn to do the terrible things the people of the other nations there do."
Deuteronomy,18,10,"Don’t sacrifice your sons or daughters in the fires on your altars. Don’t try to learn what will happen in the future by talking to a fortuneteller or by going to a magician, a witch, or a sorcerer."
Deuteronomy,18,11,Don’t let anyone try to put magic spells on other people. Don’t let any of your people become a medium or a wizard. And no one should try to talk with someone who has died.
Deuteronomy,18,12,"The LORD hates anyone who does these things. And because these other nations do these terrible things, the hates anyone who does these things. And because these other nations do these terrible things, the LORD your God will force them out of the land as you enter it."
Deuteronomy,18,13,"You must be faithful to the LORD your God, never doing anything he considers wrong."
Deuteronomy,18,14,“You will force the other nations out of your land. They listen to people who use magic and try to tell the future. But the LORD your God will not let you do these things.
Deuteronomy,18,15,"The LORD your God will send to you a prophet. This prophet will come from among your own people, and he will be like me. You must listen to him."
Deuteronomy,18,16,"God will send you this prophet because that is what you asked him to do. When you were gathered together at Mount Horeb, you became frightened and said, ‘Don’t let us hear the voice of the LORD our God again! Don’t let us see that great fire or we will die!’"
Deuteronomy,18,17,"“The LORD said to me, ‘What they ask for is good."
Deuteronomy,18,18,"I will send them a prophet like you. This prophet will be one of their own people. I will tell him what he must say, and he will tell the people everything I command."
Deuteronomy,18,19,"This prophet will speak for me, and I will punish anyone who refuses to listen to my commands.’"
Deuteronomy,18,20,"“But a prophet might say something that I did not tell him to say. And he might tell people that he is speaking for me. If this happens, that prophet must be killed. Also a prophet might come that speaks for other gods. That prophet must also be killed."
Deuteronomy,18,21,"You might be thinking, ‘How can we know if something a prophet says is not from the LORD?’"
Deuteronomy,18,22,"If a prophet says he is speaking for the LORD, but what he says does not happen, you will know that the , but what he says does not happen, you will know that the LORD did not say it. You will know that this prophet was speaking his own ideas. You don’t need to be afraid of him."
Deuteronomy,19,1,“The LORD your God is giving you land that belongs to other nations. The your God is giving you land that belongs to other nations. The LORD your God will destroy those nations. You will live where these people lived. You will take their cities and their houses. When that happens
Deuteronomy,19,2,you must divide the land that the LORD your God is giving you. Divide it into three parts and choose a city in the middle of each part that can be a place of safety. You must also build good roads to these cities. Then whoever kills another person may run to the closest city of safety.
Deuteronomy,19,3,you must divide the land that the LORD your God is giving you. Divide it into three parts and choose a city in the middle of each part that can be a place of safety. You must also build good roads to these cities. Then whoever kills another person may run to the closest city of safety.
Deuteronomy,19,4,"“This is the rule for someone who kills another person and runs to one of these three cities for safety: It must be someone who killed another person accidentally, not out of hatred."
Deuteronomy,19,5,"Here is an example: A man goes into the forest with another person to cut wood. The man swings his ax to cut down a tree, but the head of the ax separates from the handle. The ax head hits the other person and kills him. The man who swung the ax may then run to one of these three cities and be safe."
Deuteronomy,19,6,"But if the city is too far away, he might not be able to run there fast enough. A close relative of the person he killed might run after him and catch him before he reaches the city. The relative might kill the man in anger, even though he did not deserve to die because he did not mean to harm anyone."
Deuteronomy,19,7,That is why I commanded you to choose three special cities.
Deuteronomy,19,8,“The LORD your God promised your fathers that he would make your land larger. He will give you all the land that he promised to give to your ancestors.
Deuteronomy,19,9,"He will do this if you completely obey his commands that I give you today—if you love the LORD your God and always live the way he wants. Then, when he gives you more land, you should choose three more cities for safety. They should be added to the first three cities."
Deuteronomy,19,10,Then innocent people will not be killed in the land that the LORD your God is giving you. And you will not be guilty for any such deaths.
Deuteronomy,19,11,“But suppose there is a man who hates his neighbor. That man might hide and wait to kill the person he hates. If he kills that person and runs to one of these cities of safety
Deuteronomy,19,12,the elders in his hometown must send someone to get him and take him away from the city of safety. These leaders must hand him over to the close relative. He is a murderer and he must die.
Deuteronomy,19,13,"Don’t feel sorry for him. He is guilty of killing an innocent person, and you must remove that guilt from Israel. Then everything will go well for you."
Deuteronomy,19,14,“You must not move the stones that mark your neighbor’s property. People put them there in the past to mark each person’s property. These stones mark the land that the LORD your God gave you.
Deuteronomy,19,15,"“If someone is accused of doing something against the law, one witness is not enough to prove that the person is guilty. There must be two or three witnesses to prove that the person really did wrong."
Deuteronomy,19,16,“A witness might try to hurt another person by lying and saying that this person did wrong.
Deuteronomy,19,17,"If that happens, both of them must go to the LORD’s special house and be judged by the priests and judges who are on duty at that time."
Deuteronomy,19,18,"When the judges carefully ask their questions, they might find that the witness lied against the other person. If the witnesses tell lies"
Deuteronomy,19,19,you must punish them with the same punishment the other person would have received. In this way you will remove this evil from your group.
Deuteronomy,19,20,"Other people will hear about this and be afraid, and people will not do evil things like that again."
Deuteronomy,19,21,"“Don’t feel sorry about punishing someone who does wrong. If a life is taken, a life must be paid for it. The rule is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot—the punishment must equal the crime."
Deuteronomy,20,1,"“When you go out to battle against your enemies, and you see horses, chariots, and many more people than you have, you must not be afraid of them. The LORD your God is with you—and he brought you out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,20,2,"“When you go to the battle, the priest must go to the soldiers and speak to them."
Deuteronomy,20,3,"The priest will say, ‘Men of Israel, listen to me! Today you are going against your enemies in battle. Don’t lose your courage. Don’t be troubled or upset. Don’t be afraid of the enemy."
Deuteronomy,20,4,The LORD your God is going with you to help you fight against your enemies. He will help you win!’
Deuteronomy,20,5,"“The Levite officials will say to the soldiers, ‘Is there any man here who has built a new house but has not yet dedicated it? That man should go back home. He might be killed in the battle, and then another person will dedicate that man’s house."
Deuteronomy,20,6,"Is there any man here who has planted a vineyard but has not yet gathered any of the grapes? That man should go back home. If that man dies in the battle, someone else will enjoy the fruit from his field."
Deuteronomy,20,7,"Is there any man here who is engaged to be married? That man should go back home. If he dies in the battle, another man will marry the woman he is engaged to.’"
Deuteronomy,20,8,"“These Levite officials must also say to the people, ‘Is there any man here who has lost his courage and is afraid? He should go back home. Then he will not cause the other soldiers to lose their courage too.’"
Deuteronomy,20,9,"Then, after the officers have finished speaking to the army, they must choose captains to lead the soldiers."
Deuteronomy,20,10,"“When you go to attack a city, you must first offer peace to the people there."
Deuteronomy,20,11,"If they accept your offer and open their gates, all the people in that city will become your slaves and be forced to work for you."
Deuteronomy,20,12,"But if the city refuses to make peace with you and fights against you, you should surround the city."
Deuteronomy,20,13,"And when the LORD your God lets you take the city, you must kill all the men in it."
Deuteronomy,20,14,"But you may take for yourselves the women, the children, the cattle, and everything else in the city. You may use all these things. The LORD your God has given these things to you."
Deuteronomy,20,15,That is what you must do to all the cities that are very far from you—the cities that are not in the land where you will live.
Deuteronomy,20,16,"“But when you take cities in the land that the LORD your God is giving you, you must kill everyone."
Deuteronomy,20,17,"You must completely destroy all the people—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. The LORD your God has commanded you to do this."
Deuteronomy,20,18,So then they will not be able to teach you to sin against the LORD your God or to do any of the terrible things they do when they worship their gods.
Deuteronomy,20,19,"“When you are making war against a city, you might surround that city for a long time. You must not cut down the fruit trees around that city. You may eat the fruit from these trees, but you must not cut them down. These trees are not the enemy, so don’t make war against them."
Deuteronomy,20,20,But you may cut down the trees that you know are not fruit trees. You may use these trees to build weapons for making war against that city. You may use them until the city falls.
Deuteronomy,21,1,"“In the land that the LORD your God is giving you, you might find a dead body in a field, but no one knows who killed that person."
Deuteronomy,21,2,Your leaders and judges must come out and measure the distance to the towns around the dead body.
Deuteronomy,21,3,"When you learn which town is nearest to the dead body, the leaders of that town must take a cow from their herds. It must be a cow that never had a calf and that has never been used for work."
Deuteronomy,21,4,The leaders of that town must then bring the cow down to a valley with running water. It must be a valley that has never been plowed or had anything planted in it. Then the leaders must break the cow’s neck there in that valley.
Deuteronomy,21,5,"The priests, the descendants of Levi, must also go there. (The LORD your God has chosen these priests to serve him and to bless people in the name of the your God has chosen these priests to serve him and to bless people in the name of the LORD. The priests will decide who is right in every lawsuit and whenever someone is hurt.)"
Deuteronomy,21,6,All the leaders of the town nearest the dead body must wash their hands over the cow that had its neck broken in the valley.
Deuteronomy,21,7,"These leaders must say, ‘We did not kill this person, and we did not see it happen."
Deuteronomy,21,8,"LORD, you saved your people Israel. Now make us pure. Don’t blame us for killing an innocent person.’ In this way these men will not be blamed for killing an innocent person."
Deuteronomy,21,9,In this way you will remove that guilt from your group by doing what the LORD said.
Deuteronomy,21,10,"“You might fight against your enemies, and the LORD your God might let you defeat them and take them as captives."
Deuteronomy,21,11,You might see a beautiful woman among the captives who you want to be your wife.
Deuteronomy,21,12,You must then bring her into your house where she will shave her head and cut her nails.
Deuteronomy,21,13,"She must change her clothes and take off the clothes she was wearing when she was captured in war. She will stay in your house and be sad about losing her father and her mother for a full month. After that you may go to her to be her husband, and she will be your wife."
Deuteronomy,21,14,"If you are not pleased with her and choose to divorce her, set her free. You cannot sell her. You had sexual relations with her, so you must not treat her like a slave."
Deuteronomy,21,15,"“A man might have two wives. He might love one wife more than the other. Both wives might have children for him, but the firstborn son might be from the wife he does not love."
Deuteronomy,21,16,"When the man divides his property among his children, he cannot give the rights of the firstborn to the son of his favorite wife."
Deuteronomy,21,17,The man must accept the firstborn son from the wife he does not love. The man must give that son a double share of everything he owns because that son is his first child. The right of the firstborn belongs to that son.
Deuteronomy,21,18,"“A man might have a son who is stubborn and refuses to obey. This son does not obey his father or mother. They punish the son, but he still refuses to listen to them."
Deuteronomy,21,19,His father and mother must then take him to the leaders of the town at the town meeting place.
Deuteronomy,21,20,They must say to the leaders of the town: ‘Our son is stubborn and refuses to obey. He does not do anything we tell him to do. He eats and he drinks too much.’
Deuteronomy,21,21,Then the men in the town must kill the son with stones. By doing this you will remove this evil from your group. Everyone in Israel will hear about this and be afraid.
Deuteronomy,21,22,“A man might be guilty of a sin that must be punished by death. People might kill him and hang his body on a tree.
Deuteronomy,21,23,"You must not let that body stay on the tree overnight. You must be sure to bury this man on the same day, because the one who hangs on a tree is cursed by God, and you must not let the land that the LORD your God is giving you become unclean."
Deuteronomy,22,1,"“If you see that your neighbor’s ox or sheep is loose, you must not ignore it. Be sure to take it back to its owner."
Deuteronomy,22,2,"If the owner does not live near you or if you don’t know who it belongs to, take the ox or sheep to your house. Keep it there until the owner comes looking for it; then give it back."
Deuteronomy,22,3,You must do the same thing when you find anything that your neighbor might have lost. Don’t try selling it to your neighbor—you must give it back.
Deuteronomy,22,4,"“If your neighbor’s donkey or ox has fallen down on the road, you must not ignore it. You must help your neighbor lift it up again."
Deuteronomy,22,5,"“A woman must not wear men’s clothes, and a man must not wear women’s clothes. That is disgusting to the LORD your God."
Deuteronomy,22,6,"“You might be walking along a path and find a bird’s nest in a tree or on the ground. If the mother bird is sitting with her baby birds or on the eggs, you must not take the mother bird with the babies."
Deuteronomy,22,7,"You may take the babies for yourself, but you must let the mother go. If you obey these laws, things will go well for you, and you will live a long time."
Deuteronomy,22,8,"“When you build a new house, you must build a wall around your roof. Then you will not be guilty for the death of a person who falls from the house."
Deuteronomy,22,9,“You must not plant seeds of grain in the same fields as your grapevines. Why? Because then they become useless—both the grapes and the grain produced by the seeds you planted.
Deuteronomy,22,10,“You must not plow with an ox and a donkey together.
Deuteronomy,22,11,“You must not wear clothes made by weaving together wool and linen.
Deuteronomy,22,12,“Tie several pieces of thread together. Then put these tassels on the four corners of the robes you wear.
Deuteronomy,22,13,“A man might marry a woman and have sexual relations with her. Then he might decide that he does not like her.
Deuteronomy,22,14,"He might accuse her of doing wrong and say, ‘I married this woman, but when we had sexual relations, I found she was not a virgin.’ By saying this against her, people might think bad things about her."
Deuteronomy,22,15,"If this happens, the girl’s father and mother must bring the proof that the girl was a virgin to the town elders at the meeting place of the town."
Deuteronomy,22,16,"The girl’s father must say to the leaders, ‘I gave my daughter to this man to be his wife, but now he does not want her."
Deuteronomy,22,17,"This man accused my daughter of doing wrong and said, “I did not find the proof that your daughter is a virgin.” But here is the proof that my daughter was a virgin.’ Then they should show the cloth to the town leaders."
Deuteronomy,22,18,Then the leaders of that town must take that man and punish him.
Deuteronomy,22,19,They must fine him 40 ounces of silver. They will give the money to the girl’s father because her husband brought shame to an Israelite girl. And the girl will continue to be the man’s wife. He cannot divorce her for the rest of his life.
Deuteronomy,22,20,“But what the husband said about his wife might be true. The wife’s parents might not have the proof that she was a virgin. If this happens
Deuteronomy,22,21,"the town leaders must bring the girl to the door of her father’s house. Then the men of the town must kill her with stones, because she has done a shameful thing in Israel. She has acted like a prostitute in her father’s house. You must remove this evil from your group."
Deuteronomy,22,22,"“If a man is found having sexual relations with another man’s wife, both of them must die—the woman and the man who had sexual relations with her. You must remove this evil from Israel."
Deuteronomy,22,23,“A man might meet a virgin girl engaged to another man. He might have sexual relations with her. If this happens in the city
Deuteronomy,22,24,"you must bring them both out to the public place near the gate of that city, and you must kill them with stones. You must kill the man, because he used another man’s wife for sexual sin. And you must kill the girl, because she was in the city but did not call for help. You must remove this evil from your people."
Deuteronomy,22,25,"“But if a man finds an engaged girl out in the field and forces her to have sexual relations with him, only the man must die."
Deuteronomy,22,26,You must do nothing to the girl. She did nothing that deserves the punishment of death. This is like someone attacking their neighbor and killing them.
Deuteronomy,22,27,"The man found the engaged girl out in the field and attacked her. Maybe she called for help, but there was no one to help her."
Deuteronomy,22,28,“A man might find a virgin girl who is not engaged and force her to have sexual relations with him. If other people see this happen
Deuteronomy,22,29,"he must pay the girl’s father 20 ounces of silver. And the girl will become the man’s wife, because he used her for sexual sin. He cannot divorce her all his life."

Deuteronomy,23,4,"The Ammonites and Moabites refused to give you bread and water on your trip at the time you came from Egypt. They also tried to hire Balaam, the son of Beor from the Mesopotamian city of Pethor, to curse you."
Deuteronomy,23,5,"But the LORD your God refused to do what Balaam asked. Instead, the your God refused to do what Balaam asked. Instead, the LORD changed the curse into a blessing for you, because the changed the curse into a blessing for you, because the LORD your God loves you."
Deuteronomy,23,6,"You must never try to make peace with the Ammonites or Moabites. As long as you live, don’t be friendly to them."
Deuteronomy,23,7,"“You must not hate Edomites, because they are your relatives. You must not hate Egyptians, because you were a stranger in their land."

Deuteronomy,24,3,"But suppose the new husband also does not like her and sends her away. If that man divorces her, the first husband may not take her again to be his wife.

Deuteronomy,31,13,"If their descendants don’t know the teachings, they will hear them, and they will learn to respect the LORD your God. They will respect him as long as you live in your country. You will soon go across the Jordan River and take that land to be your own.”"
Deuteronomy,31,14,"The LORD said to Moses, “Now the time is near for you to die. Get Joshua and come to the Meeting Tent. I will tell Joshua what he must do.” So Moses and Joshua went to the Meeting Tent."
Deuteronomy,31,15,The LORD appeared at the Tent in a tall cloud. The tall cloud stood over the entrance of the Tent.
Deuteronomy,31,16,"The LORD said to Moses, “You will die soon. And after you have gone to be with your ancestors, these people will not continue to be faithful to me. They will break the agreement I made with them. They will leave me and begin worshiping other gods—the false gods of the land where they are going."
Deuteronomy,31,17,"At that time I will become very angry with them, and I will leave them. I will refuse to help them, and they will be destroyed. Terrible things will happen to them, and they will have many troubles. Then they will say, ‘These bad things happened to us because our God is not with us.’"
Deuteronomy,31,18,"And I will refuse to help them, because they have done evil and worshiped other gods."
Deuteronomy,31,19,"“So write down this song, and teach it to the Israelites. Teach them to sing this song. Then this song will be a witness for me against the Israelites."
Deuteronomy,31,20,I will take them into the land that I promised to give to their ancestors—a land filled with many good things. And they will have all they want to eat. They will have a rich life. But then they will turn to other gods and serve them. They will turn away from me and break my agreement.
Deuteronomy,31,21,"Then many terrible things will happen to them. They will have many troubles. At that time their descendants will still know this song, and it will show them how wrong they are. I have not yet taken them into the land I promised to give them. But I already know what they are planning to do there.”"
Deuteronomy,31,22,So that same day Moses wrote down the song and taught it to the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,31,23,"Then the Lord spoke to Joshua son of Nun and said, “Be strong and brave. You will lead the Israelites into the land I promised them, and I will be with you.”"
Deuteronomy,31,24,Moses carefully wrote all these teachings in a book. When he finished
Deuteronomy,31,25,he gave a command to the Levites. (These men carry the LORD’s Box of the Agreement.) Moses said
Deuteronomy,31,26,“Take this Book of Teachings and put it by the side of the Box of the Agreement of the LORD your God. Then it will be a witness against you.
Deuteronomy,31,27,"I know you are very stubborn. I know you want to live your own way. Look, you refused to obey the LORD while I was with you. So I know you will refuse to obey him after I die."
Deuteronomy,31,28,Bring together all the officers and leaders of your tribes. I will tell them these things. And I will call heaven and earth to be witnesses against them.
Deuteronomy,31,29,"I know that after my death you will become evil. You will turn from the way I commanded you to follow. Terrible things will happen to you in the future, because you want to do what the LORD says is wrong. You will make him angry because of the evil things you do.”"

so that people would forget them completely!"
