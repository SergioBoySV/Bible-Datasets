“A lion might attack a lamb,
and a shepherd might try to save the lamb.
But the shepherd will save
only a part of that lamb.

“Come looking for me and live."

and no one in Bethel can stop it."

He is the one who made the Pleiades and Orion.

He changes the day into the dark night.

His name is YAHWEH!

You change justice to poison.
You throw away fairness like trash."
Amos,5,10,"You hate those prophets, who go to public places and speak against evil,
even though they teach good, simple truths."
Amos,5,11,"You take unfair taxes from the poor.
You take loads of wheat from them.
You build fancy houses with cut stone,
but you will not live in them.
You plant beautiful vineyards,
but you will not drink the wine from them."
Amos,5,12,"This is because I know about your many sins.
You have done some very bad things:
You hurt people who do right,
you accept money to do wrong,
and you keep the poor from receiving justice in court."
Amos,5,13,"At that time wise teachers will be quiet,
because it is a bad time."
Amos,5,14,"You say that God is with you,
so you should do good things, not evil.
Then you will live,
and the LORD God All-Powerful will be with you."

Bring justice back into the courts.
Maybe then the LORD God All-Powerful
will be kind to the survivors from Joseph’s family."

because I will pass through and punish you.”
This is what the LORD said."
Amos,5,18,"Some of you want to see
the LORD’s special day of judgment.
Why do you want to see that day of the LORD?
His special day will bring darkness, not light."
Amos,5,19,"You will be like someone who escapes from a lion
only to be attacked by a bear,
or like someone who goes into the safety of his house,
leans against the wall,
and is bitten by a snake."
Amos,5,20,"The LORD’s special day will be
a day of darkness, not light—a day of gloom, without a ray of light."
Amos,5,21,"“I hate your festivals;
I will not accept them.
I don’t enjoy your religious meetings."
Amos,5,22,"Even if you offer me burnt offerings and grain offerings,
I will not accept them.
I will not even look at the fat animals
you give as fellowship offerings."

I will not listen to the music from your harps."

and offerings in the desert for 40 years."

This is what the LORD says.
His name is God All-Powerful."

From there, go to the large city Hamath.

Their countries are larger than yours."
Amos,6,3,"You people are rushing toward the day of punishment.
You bring near the rule of violence."
Amos,6,4,"But now you lie on ivory beds
and stretch out on your couches.
You eat tender young lambs from the flock
and young calves from the stable."
Amos,6,5,"You play your harps,
and like David, you practice on your musical instruments."
Amos,6,6,"You drink wine in fancy cups.
You use the best perfumes.
And it doesn’t even bother you
that Joseph’s family is being destroyed."
Amos,6,7,"You people are stretched out on your couches now, but your good times will end. You will be taken away as prisoners to a foreign country, and you will be some of the first people taken."
Amos,6,8,"The Lord GOD used his own name and made an oath. The LORD God All-Powerful said,
“I hate what Jacob is proud of.
I hate his strong towers.
So I will let an enemy take the city
and everything in it.”"
Amos,6,9,"At that time ten people in one house might survive, but they too will die."
Amos,6,10,"And when someone dies, a relative will come to get the body so that it can be taken out and burned. Relatives will come to take away the bones. They will call to anyone who might be hiding back in the house, “Are there any other dead bodies in there with you?”
That person will answer, “No, ….”
But the relative will interrupt and say, “Hush! We must not mention the name of the LORD.”"
Amos,6,11,"Look, the LORD will give the command,
and the large houses will be broken to pieces,
and the small houses will be broken to small pieces."

And you boast, “We have taken Karnaim by our own strength.”"
Amos,6,14,"“But Israel, I will bring a nation against you that will bring troubles to your whole country from Lebo Hamath to Arabah Brook.” This is what the LORD God All-Powerful said."
Amos,7,1,"This is what the Lord GOD showed me: He was making locusts. This was at the time the second crop began to grow, after the king’s people had cut the first crop."
Amos,7,2,"Before the locusts could eat all the grass in the country, I said, “Lord GOD, I beg you, forgive us! Jacob cannot survive! He is too small!”"
Amos,7,3,"Then the LORD changed his mind about this. The changed his mind about this. The LORD said, “It will not happen.”"
Amos,7,4,This is what the Lord GOD showed me: I saw the Lord GOD calling for judgment by fire. The fire destroyed the ocean and was beginning to eat up the land.
Amos,7,5,"But I said, “Lord GOD, stop, I beg you! Jacob cannot survive! He is too small!”"
Amos,7,6,"Then the LORD changed his mind about this. The Lord GOD said, “It will not happen either.”"
Amos,7,7,This is what the Lord showed me: He stood by a wall with a plumb line in his hand. (The wall had been marked with a plumb line.)
Amos,7,8,"The LORD said to me, “Amos, what do you see?”
I said, “A plumb line.”
Then the Lord said to me, “See, I will put a plumb line among my people Israel. I will not let their ‘crooked ways’ pass inspection anymore."
Amos,7,9,Isaac’s high places will be destroyed. Israel’s holy places will be made into a pile of rocks. I will attack and kill Jeroboam’s family with swords.”
Amos,7,10,"Amaziah, a priest at Bethel, sent this message to Jeroboam, the king of Israel: “Amos is making plans against you. He is trying to make the people of Israel fight against you. He has been speaking so much that this country cannot hold all his words."
Amos,7,11,"Amos has said, ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and the people of Israel will be taken as prisoners out of their country.’”"
Amos,7,12,"Amaziah also said to Amos, “You seer, go down to Judah and eat there. Do your prophesying there."
Amos,7,13,But don’t prophesy anymore here at Bethel. This is Jeroboam’s holy place. This is Israel’s temple.”
Amos,7,14,"Then Amos answered Amaziah, “I am not a professional prophet, and I am not from a prophet’s family. I raise cattle and take care of sycamore trees."
Amos,7,15,"I was a shepherd and the LORD took me from following the sheep. The took me from following the sheep. The LORD said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’"
Amos,7,16,"So listen to the LORD’s message. You tell me, ‘Don’t prophesy against Israel. Don’t speak against Isaac’s family.’"
Amos,7,17,"But the LORD says, ‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the city. Your sons and daughters will be killed with swords. Other people will take your land and divide it among themselves, and you will die in a foreign country. The people of Israel will definitely be taken from this country as prisoners.’”"
Amos,8,1,This is what the Lord GOD showed me: I saw a basket of summer fruit.
Amos,8,2,"He said to me, “Amos, what do you see?”
I said, “A basket of summer fruit.”
Then the LORD said to me, “The end has come to my people Israel. I will not ignore their sins anymore."
Amos,8,3,"Their temple songs will become funeral songs.” This is what the Lord GOD said. “There will be dead bodies everywhere. In silence, people will take out the dead bodies and throw them onto the pile.”"
Amos,8,4,"Listen to me, you who trample on helpless people.
You are trying to destroy the poor of this country."
Amos,8,5,"You merchants say,
“When will the New Moon be over so that we can sell grain?
When will the Sabbath be over
so that we can bring out more wheat to sell?
We can raise the price
and make the measure smaller.
We can fix the scales
and cheat the people."
Amos,8,6,"The poor cannot pay their loans,
so we will buy them as slaves.
We will buy those helpless people
for the price of a pair of sandals.
Oh, and we can sell the wheat
that was spilled on the floor.”"
Amos,8,7,"The LORD made a promise. He used his name, “Pride of Jacob,” and made this promise:
“I will never forget what those people did."
Amos,8,8,"There will be an earthquake
that will shake the whole land because of what they did.
Everyone living there will cry for those who died.
The land will be tossed around.
The whole land will rise and fall like the Nile River in Egypt.”"
Amos,8,9,"The Lord GOD also said,
“At that time I will make the sun set at noon
and make the land dark on a clear day."
Amos,8,10,"I will change your festivals into days of crying for the dead.
All your songs will be songs of sadness for those who are dead.
I will put mourning clothes on every body
and baldness on every head.
I will cause mourning everywhere,
like that for an only son who has died.
It will be a very bitter end.”"
Amos,8,11,"The Lord GOD says,
“Look, the days are coming
when I will cause a famine in the land.
The people will not be hungry for bread.
They will not be thirsty for water.
No, they will be hungry for words from the LORD."
Amos,8,12,"The people will wander around the country,
from the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean Sea,
and from the north part of the country to the east.
They will go back and forth looking for a message from the LORD,
but they will not find it."
Amos,8,13,"At that time the beautiful young men and women
will become weak from thirst."
Amos,8,14,"They made promises by the sin of Samaria,
They said, ‘Dan, as surely as your god lives, we promise ….’
And they said, ‘As surely as the god of Beersheba lives, we promise ….’
But they will fall
and never get up again.”"
Amos,9,1,"I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and he said,
“Hit the top of the columns,
and shake them to the ground.
Push them and they will fall
on everyone’s head.
As for those who survive,
I will kill them with a sword.
None of them will run away.
None of them will escape."
Amos,9,2,"If they dig deep into the ground,
I will pull them from there.
If they go up into the skies,
I will bring them down from there."
Amos,9,3,"If they hide at the top of Mount Carmel,
I will find them there and take them from that place.
If they try to hide from me at the bottom of the sea,
I will command the snake, and it will bite them."
Amos,9,4,"If they are captured and taken away by their enemies,
I will command the sword,
and it will kill them there.
Yes, I will watch over them,
but I will watch for ways to give them troubles,
not for ways to do good things.”"
Amos,9,5,"The Lord GOD All-Powerful will touch the land,
and the land will melt.
Then all the people who live in the land will cry for the dead.
The land will rise and fall
like the Nile River in Egypt."
Amos,9,6,"He built his upper rooms above the skies.
He put his skies over the earth.
He calls for the waters of the sea
and pours them out as rain on the land.
YAHWEH is his name."
Amos,9,7,"This is what the LORD says:
“Israel, you are like the Ethiopians to me.
I brought Israel out of the land of Egypt,
the Philistines from Caphtor,
and the Arameans from Kir.”"
Amos,9,8,"The Lord GOD is watching this sinful kingdom.
The LORD says,
“I will wipe Israel off the face of the earth,
but I will never completely destroy Jacob’s family."
Amos,9,9,"I am giving the command
to scatter the people of Israel among all nations.
But it will be like someone sifting flour.
A person shakes flour through a sifter.
The good flour falls through, but the bad lumps are caught."

‘Nothing bad will happen to us.’
But all of them will be killed with swords.”"

but at that time I will set it up again.
I will fix its holes and repair its ruined parts.
I will set it up as it was before."

and all the people called by my name, will look to me for help.”
This is what the LORD said,
and he will make it happen."
Amos,9,13,"The LORD says, “A time of great blessing is coming.
Workers will still be harvesting
when it is time to plow the fields again.
They will still be trampling the grapes
when it is time for a new crop.
Sweet wine will drip from the mountains
and pour from the hills."
Amos,9,14,"I will bring my people, Israel,
back from captivity.
They will rebuild the ruined cities,
and they will live in them.
They will plant vineyards
and drink the wine they produce.
They will plant gardens
and eat the crops they produce."
Amos,9,15,"I will plant my people on their land,
and never again will they be pulled up out of the land that I gave them.”
This is what the LORD your God said."
