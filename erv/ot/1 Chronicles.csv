1 Chronicles,20,2,David took the crown from their king’s head. That gold crown weighed about 75 pounds and there were valuable stones in it. The crown was put on David’s head. Then David had a great many valuable things brought out of the city of Rabbah.

1 Chronicles,21,3,"But Joab answered, “May the LORD make his nation 100 times as large! Sir, all the Israelites are your servants. Why do you want to do this thing, my lord and king? You will make all the Israelites guilty of sin!”"
1 Chronicles,21,4,But King David was stubborn. Joab had to do what the king said. So Joab left and went through all the country of Israel counting the people. Then he came back to Jerusalem
1 Chronicles,21,5,"and told David how many people there were. In Israel there were 1,100,000 men who could use a sword. And there were 470,000 men in Judah who could use a sword."
