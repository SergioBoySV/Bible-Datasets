Isaiah,1,1,"This is the vision of Isaiah son of Amoz. God showed Isaiah what would happen to Judah and Jerusalem. Isaiah saw this during the time when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah."
Isaiah,1,2,"Heaven and earth, listen! This is what the LORD says:
“I raised my children and helped them grow up,
but they have turned against me."
Isaiah,1,3,"A bull knows its master,
and a donkey knows where its owner feeds it.
But Israel does not know me.
My people do not understand.”"
Isaiah,1,4,"Oh, what a sinful nation! Their guilt is like a heavy weight that they must carry. They are evil, destructive children. They left the LORD and insulted the Holy One of Israel. They turned away and treated him like a stranger."
Isaiah,1,5,What good will it do to keep punishing you? You will continue to rebel. Your whole head and heart are already sick and aching.
Isaiah,1,6,"From the bottom of your feet to the top of your head, every part of your body has wounds, cuts, and open sores. You have not taken care of them. Your wounds have not been cleaned and bandaged."
Isaiah,1,7,"Your land is in ruins, and your cities are in flames. Your enemies have taken your land, and foreigners are taking what it produces. It looks like some foreigners destroyed it."
Isaiah,1,8,The city of Jerusalem is now like an empty shed left in a vineyard. It is like an old straw hut abandoned in a field of cucumbers or like a city surrounded by enemies.
Isaiah,1,9,"If the LORD All-Powerful had not allowed a few people to live, we would have been destroyed completely like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. And that almost happened!"
Isaiah,1,10,"You officers of Sodom, listen to the LORD’s message. You people of Gomorrah, listen to God’s teaching."
Isaiah,1,11,"The LORD says, “Why do you continue giving me all these sacrifices? I have had enough of your sacrifices of rams and the fat from well-fed animals. I don’t want the blood of those bulls, sheep, and goats."
Isaiah,1,12,"When you people come to meet with me, you trample everything in my yard. Who told you to do this?"
Isaiah,1,13,"“Don’t keep bringing me those worthless sacrifices. I hate the incense you give me. I cannot stand your festivals for the New Moon, the Sabbath, and other special meeting days. I hate the evil you do during those holy times together."
Isaiah,1,14,"I hate your monthly meetings and councils. They have become like heavy weights to me, and I am tired of carrying them."
Isaiah,1,15,"“When you raise your arms to pray to me, I will refuse to look at you. You will say more and more prayers, but I will refuse to listen because your hands are covered with blood."
Isaiah,1,16,“Wash yourselves and make yourselves clean. Stop doing the evil things I see you do. Stop doing wrong.
Isaiah,1,17,Learn to do good. Treat people fairly. Punish those who hurt others. Speak up for the widows and orphans. Argue their cases for them in court.
Isaiah,1,18,"“I, the LORD, am the one speaking to you. Come, let’s discuss this. Even if your sins are as dark as red dye, that stain can be removed and you will be as pure as wool that is as white as snow."
Isaiah,1,19,"“If you listen to what I say, you will get the good things from this land."
Isaiah,1,20,"But if you refuse to listen and rebel against me, your enemies will destroy you.”
The LORD himself said this."
Isaiah,1,21,"Look at Jerusalem. She was a faithful city. What made her become like a prostitute? In the past, Jerusalem was filled with justice, and goodness should live there now. Instead, there are murderers."
Isaiah,1,22,"Once you were like pure silver, but now you are like the impurities that people throw away when the silver is purified. You are like good wine that has been weakened with water."
Isaiah,1,23,"Your rulers are rebels and friends of thieves. They demand bribes and accept money for doing wrong. They take money to cheat people, and they don’t speak up for widows and orphans. They will not even listen to their cries for help."
Isaiah,1,24,"Because of this, the Lord GOD All-Powerful, the Mighty One of Israel, says, “Look, I will get relief from my enemies. You will not cause me any more trouble."
Isaiah,1,25,"People use lye to clean silver. In the same way, I will clean away all your wrongs. I will remove all the impurities from you."
Isaiah,1,26,I will bring back the kind of judges you had in the beginning. Your counselors will be like those you had long ago. Then you will be called ‘The Good and Faithful City.’”
Isaiah,1,27,"God is good and does what is right, so he will rescue Zion and the people who come back to him."
Isaiah,1,28,But all the criminals and sinners will be destroyed. Those who stopped following the LORD will be removed.
Isaiah,1,29,"In the future, you will be ashamed of the oak trees and special gardens you chose to worship"
Isaiah,1,30,because you will be like an oak tree whose leaves are dying. You will be like a garden dying without water.
Isaiah,1,31,"Powerful people will be like small, dry pieces of wood, and what they did will be like the sparks that start a fire. These people and their works will both burn up, and no one will be able to put out that fire."
Isaiah,2,1,Isaiah son of Amoz received this message about Judah and Jerusalem.
Isaiah,2,2,"In the last days the mountain of the LORD’s Temple
will be the highest of all mountains.
It will be raised higher than the hills.
There will be a steady stream of people from all nations going there."
Isaiah,2,3,"People from many places will go there and say,
“Come, let’s go up to the mountain of the LORD,
to the Temple of the God of Jacob.
Then God will teach us his way of living,
and we will follow him.”
His teaching, the LORD’s message, will begin in Jerusalem on Mount Zion
and will go out to all the world."
Isaiah,2,4,"Then God will act as judge to end arguments between nations.
He will decide what is right for people from many lands.
They will stop using their weapons for war.
They will hammer their swords into plows
and use their spears to make tools for harvesting.
All fighting between nations will end.
They will never again train for war."
Isaiah,2,5,"Family of Jacob, let us follow the LORD."
Isaiah,2,6,"Family of Jacob, you have abandoned your people. This is clear because they have been filled with bad influences from the East, and now your people try to tell the future like the Philistines. They have completely accepted those strange ideas."
Isaiah,2,7,Jacob’s land has been filled with silver and gold from other places. There are many treasures there. His land has been filled with horses and many chariots.
Isaiah,2,8,His land is full of gods that the people bow down to worship. They made those idols themselves.
Isaiah,2,9,"The people have become worse and worse. They have become very low, and you leaders did nothing to lift them up!"
Isaiah,2,10,You should be afraid of the LORD! Go hide in the dirt and behind the rocks. Hide from his glorious power!
Isaiah,2,11,"Proud people will stop being proud. They will bow down to the ground with shame, and only the LORD will still stand high."
Isaiah,2,12,The LORD All-Powerful has a special day planned when he will punish the proud and boastful people. They will be brought down.
Isaiah,2,13,"They might be like the tall cedar trees from Lebanon or the great oak trees from Bashan, but they will be cut down."
Isaiah,2,14,They might be like the tall mountains and high hills
Isaiah,2,15,"or like the tall towers and high walls, but they will be brought down."
Isaiah,2,16,"They might be like great ships from Tarshish, filled with such wonderful cargo, but they will be brought down."
Isaiah,2,17,"At that time those proud people will fall. They will bow low to the ground, and only the LORD will stand high."
Isaiah,2,18,All the idols will be gone.
Isaiah,2,19,People will go into the holes in the ground and the cracks in the rocks because they fear the LORD and his great power as he stands to shake the earth.
Isaiah,2,20,"At that time people will throw away their idols they made from gold and silver. They made these statues to worship, but they will throw them into holes in the ground where bats and moles live."
Isaiah,2,21,They will go down into cracks in the rocks and boulders because they are afraid of the LORD and his glorious power as he stands to shake the earth.
Isaiah,2,22,Stop trusting other people to save you. Do not think too highly of them; they are only humans who have not stopped breathing yet.
Isaiah,3,1,Understand what I am telling you: The Lord GOD All-Powerful will take away everything Judah and Jerusalem depend on. He will take away all the food and water.
Isaiah,3,2,"He will take away all the heroes and soldiers. He will take away all the judges, the prophets, the fortunetellers, and the elders."
Isaiah,3,3,"He will take away the army officers and important officials. He will take away the skilled counselors, the magicians, and those who try to tell the future."
Isaiah,3,4,"He says, “I will put young boys in charge of you. They will be your leaders."
Isaiah,3,5,The people will turn against each other. Young people will not respect those who are older. The common people will not respect important leaders.”
Isaiah,3,6,"At that time a man will grab one of his brothers from his own family and tell him, “You have a coat, so you will be our leader. You will be the leader over all these ruins.”"
Isaiah,3,7,"But the brother will refuse and say, “I cannot help you. I don’t have enough food or clothes for my own family. You will not make me your leader.”"
Isaiah,3,8,"This will happen because Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen. They turned against the LORD. They said and did things against him, right in front of his glorious eyes."
Isaiah,3,9,The look on their faces shows that they are guilty. They are like the people of Sodom; they don’t care who sees their sin. But it will be very bad for them. They will get what they deserve.
Isaiah,3,10,Tell the good people who do what is right that good things will happen to them. They will receive a reward for what they do.
Isaiah,3,11,"But it will be very bad for wicked people, because they, too, will get what they deserve. They will get what they did to others."
Isaiah,3,12,"Even children will defeat my people, and women will rule over them.
My people, your guides lead you the wrong way, and they destroy the path you should follow."
Isaiah,3,13,"Look, the LORD is standing to judge his people."
Isaiah,3,14,"The LORD is ready to present his case against the elders and leaders of his people.
He says, “You people have burned the vineyard, and what you stole from the poor is still in your houses."
Isaiah,3,15,What gives you the right to hurt my people? What gives you the right to push the faces of the poor into the dirt?” The Lord GOD All-Powerful said this.
Isaiah,3,16,"The LORD says, “The women in Zion have become very proud. They walk around with their heads in the air, acting like they are better than other people. They flirt with their eyes and make tinkling sounds with their ankle bracelets as they take their quick little steps.”"
Isaiah,3,17,The Lord will put sores on the heads of those women in Zion. The LORD will make their heads bald.
Isaiah,3,18,"Then the Lord will take away everything they are proud of: the beautiful ankle bracelets, the necklaces that look like the sun and the moon"
Isaiah,3,19,"the earrings, bracelets, and veils"
Isaiah,3,20,"the scarves, the ankle chains, the cloth belts worn around their waists, the bottles of perfume, the charms"
Isaiah,3,21,"the signet rings, and the nose rings"
Isaiah,3,22,"the fine dresses, robes, veils, and purses"
Isaiah,3,23,"the mirrors, linen dresses, turbans, and long shawls."
Isaiah,3,24,"Those women now have sweet-smelling perfume, but it will get moldy and stink. Now they wear belts, but then they will have only ropes to wear. Now they have their hair fixed in fancy ways, but then their heads will be shaved—they will have no hair. Now they have party dresses, but then they will have only mourning clothes. They have beauty marks on their faces now, but then they will have another mark. It will be a mark burned into their skin to show that they are slaves."
Isaiah,3,25,Your men will be killed with swords. Your heroes will die in war.
Isaiah,3,26,"There will be crying and sadness in the meeting places by the city gates. Jerusalem will sit there empty, like a woman who has lost everything to thieves and robbers and now just sits on the ground and cries."
Isaiah,4,1,"At that time seven women will grab one man and say, “Please marry us! We will supply our own food and make our own clothes. You won’t have to do anything else if you let us wear your name and take away our shame.”"
Isaiah,4,2,At that time the LORD’s plant will be very beautiful and glorious. The people in Israel who survived will be very proud of what the land grows.
Isaiah,4,3,And all those who are left in Zion and Jerusalem will be called holy. Their names were on the list of people in Jerusalem who were allowed to live.
Isaiah,4,4,"The Lord will wash away the filth from the daughters of Zion. He will wash away the blood from Jerusalem. With a spirit of judgment that burns like fire, he will make everything pure."
Isaiah,4,5,Then the LORD will create a cloud of smoke in the day and a bright flame of fire at night over every building and over every meeting of the people on the mountain of Zion. And there will be a covering over everyone for protection.
Isaiah,4,6,It will be a shelter to protect the people from the heat of the sun and from all kinds of storms and rain.
Isaiah,5,1,"Now I will sing a song for my friend, my love song about his vineyard.
My friend had a vineyard
on a very fertile hill."
Isaiah,5,2,"He dug and cleared the field
and planted the best grapevines there.
He built a tower in the middle
and cut a winepress into the stone.
He expected good grapes to grow there,
but there were only rotten ones."
Isaiah,5,3,"My friend said, “You people living in Jerusalem and you people of Judah,
think about me and my vineyard."
Isaiah,5,4,"What more could I do for my vineyard?
I did everything I could.
I hoped for good grapes to grow,
but there were only rotten ones.
Why did that happen?"
Isaiah,5,5,"“Now I will tell you
what I will do to my vineyard:
I will pull up the thornbushes that protect it,
and I will burn them.
I will break down the stone wall
and use the stones for a walkway."
Isaiah,5,6,"I will turn my vineyard into useless land.
No one will care for the plants or work in the field.
Weeds and thorns will grow there.
I will command the clouds
not to rain on it.”"
Isaiah,5,7,"The vineyard that belongs to the LORD All-Powerful is the house of Israel. The grapevine, the plant he loves, is the man of Judah.
The Lord hoped for justice,
but there was only killing.
He hoped for fairness,
but there were only cries from people being treated badly."
Isaiah,5,8,"Look at you people! You join houses to houses and fields to fields until there is no room for anyone else. But when the punishment comes, you will be forced to live alone. You will be the only people in the whole land."
Isaiah,5,9,"I heard the LORD All-Powerful make this oath: “I swear, all these houses will be destroyed. These big, fancy houses will be empty."
Isaiah,5,10,"A ten-acre vineyard will make only a little wine, and many sacks of seed will grow only a little grain.”"
Isaiah,5,11,"How terrible it will be for you people who rise early in the morning and go looking for beer to drink. You stay awake late at night, getting drunk on wine."
Isaiah,5,12,"At your parties with your wine, harps, drums, flutes, and other musical instruments, you don’t see what the LORD has done. You don’t notice what his hands have made."
Isaiah,5,13,"My people don’t really know God. So they will be captured and taken away. Everyone, the respected leaders and the common people as well, will be hungry and thirsty."
Isaiah,5,14,"They will die, and the place of death will open its mouth wide and swallow many of them. Then the noisy crowds and all the beautiful, happy people who are now so comfortable will go down into the grave."
Isaiah,5,15,"Everyone, common people and leaders alike, will be humbled. Those who are now so proud will bow their heads in shame."
Isaiah,5,16,"The LORD All-Powerful will judge fairly, and people will honor him. They will respect the Holy God when he brings justice."
Isaiah,5,17,Then sheep will be able to go wherever they want and graze on the land that rich people once owned.
Isaiah,5,18,Look at those people! They pull their guilt and sins behind them like people pulling wagons with ropes.
Isaiah,5,19,"They say, “We wish God would hurry and do what he plans to do so that we can see it. Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel happen soon so that we can know what it is.”"
Isaiah,5,20,Look at those people! They say good is bad and bad is good. They think light is dark and dark is light. They think sour is sweet and sweet is sour.
Isaiah,5,21,They think they are so smart. They think they are very intelligent.
Isaiah,5,22,They are famous for drinking wine and are heroes known for mixing drinks.
Isaiah,5,23,"And if you pay them enough money, they will forgive a criminal. But they will not let good people be judged fairly."
Isaiah,5,24,"So bad things will happen to them. Their descendants will be destroyed completely, just as fire burns straw and leaves. Their descendants will be like plants with rotten roots, whose flowers have all blown away like dust in the wind.
Those people refused to obey the teachings of the LORD All-Powerful. They hated the message from the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,5,25,"So the LORD became angry with his people, and he raised his hand to punish them. Even the mountains shook with fear. Dead bodies were left in the streets like garbage. And he is not finished yet. He is still angry, and his arm is raised to continue punishing his people."
Isaiah,5,26,"Look! God is giving a sign to the nations far away. He is raising a flag and whistling for them to come.
Now the enemy is coming from a faraway land and will soon enter the country. They are moving very quickly."
Isaiah,5,27,The enemy soldiers never get tired and stumble. They never get sleepy and fall asleep. Their weapon belts are always ready. Their sandal straps never break.
Isaiah,5,28,Their arrows are sharp. Their bows are strung and ready to shoot. The horses’ hooves are as hard as flint. Clouds of dust rise from behind their chariots.
Isaiah,5,29,"The shouts of the enemy sound like the roar of lions. Like strong, young lions, they growl and grab their prey. The captives struggle and try to escape, but there is no one to save them."
Isaiah,5,30,"Then there is a roar as loud as the ocean waves, and the captives turn their faces to the ground. And there is only darkness closing in as the light fades away in a black cloud."
Isaiah,6,1,"In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a very high and wonderful throne. His long robe filled the Temple."
Isaiah,6,2,"Seraph angels stood around him. Each angel had six wings. They used two wings to cover their faces, two wings to cover their bodies, and two wings to fly."
Isaiah,6,3,"The angels were calling to each other, “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD All-Powerful. His Glory fills the whole earth.”"
Isaiah,6,4,"The sound was so loud that it caused the frame around the door to shake, and the Temple was filled with smoke."
Isaiah,6,5,"I was frightened and said, “Oh, no! I will be destroyed. I am not pure enough to speak to God, and I live among people who are not pure enough to speak to him. But I have seen the King, the LORD All-Powerful.”"
Isaiah,6,6,There was a fire on the altar. One of the Seraph angels used a pair of tongs to take a hot coal from the fire. Then the angel flew to me with it in his hand.
Isaiah,6,7,"Then he touched my mouth with the hot coal and said, “When this hot coal touched your lips, your guilt was taken away, and your sins were erased.”"
Isaiah,6,8,"Then I heard the Lord’s voice, saying, “Who can I send? Who will go for us?”
So I said, “Here I am. Send me!”"
Isaiah,6,9,"Then the Lord said, “Go and tell the people, ‘Listen closely, but don’t understand. Look closely, but don’t learn.’"
Isaiah,6,10,"Confuse them. Make them unable to understand what they hear and see. If you don’t do this, they might really look with their eyes, hear with their ears, and understand with their minds. Then they might come back to me and be healed!”"
Isaiah,6,11,"Then I asked, “Lord, how long should I do this?”
He answered, “Do this until the cities are destroyed and all the people are gone. Do this until there is no one left living in the houses and the land is destroyed and empty.”"
Isaiah,6,12,"The LORD will make the people go far away, and there will be large areas of empty land in the country."
Isaiah,6,13,"A tenth of the people will be allowed to stay in the land, but it will be destroyed again. They will be like an oak tree. When the tree is chopped down, a stump is left. This stump will be a very special seed that will grow again."
Isaiah,7,1,"Ahaz was the son of Jotham, who was the son of Uzziah. Rezin was the king of Aram, Pekah son of Remaliah was the king of Israel. When Ahaz was king of Judah, Rezin and Pekah went up to Jerusalem to attack it, but they were not able to defeat the city."
Isaiah,7,2,"The family of David received a message that said, “The armies of Aram and Ephraim have joined together in one camp.” When King Ahaz heard this message, he and the people became frightened. They shook with fear like trees of the forest blowing in the wind."
Isaiah,7,3,"Then the LORD told Isaiah, “You and your son Shear Jashub should go out and talk to Ahaz. Go to the place where the water flows into the Upper Pool, on the street that leads up to Laundryman’s Field."
Isaiah,7,4,"“Tell Ahaz, ‘Be careful, but be calm. Don’t be afraid. Don’t let those two men, Rezin and Remaliah’s son, frighten you! They are like two burning sticks. They might be hot now, but soon they will be nothing but smoke. Rezin, Aram, and Remaliah’s son became angry"
Isaiah,7,5,and made plans against you. They said
Isaiah,7,6,“Let’s go fight against Judah and divide it among ourselves. Then we will make Tabeel’s son the new king of Judah.”’”
Isaiah,7,7,"But the Lord GOD says, “Their plan will not succeed. It will not happen"
Isaiah,7,8,"because Aram depends on its capital Damascus, and Damascus is led by its weak king Rezin. And don’t worry about Ephraim. Within 65 years it will be crushed, no longer a nation."
Isaiah,7,9,"Ephraim depends on its capital Samaria, and Samaria is led by Remaliah’s son. So you have no reason to fear. Believe this, or you will not survive.”"
Isaiah,7,10,Then the LORD spoke to Ahaz again
Isaiah,7,11,"and said, “Ask for a sign from the LORD your God to prove to yourself that this is true. You can ask for any sign you want. The sign can come from a place as deep as Sheol or as high as the skies.”"
Isaiah,7,12,"But Ahaz said, “I will not ask for a sign as proof. I will not test the LORD.”"
Isaiah,7,13,"Then Isaiah said, “Family of David, listen very carefully! Is it not enough that you would test the patience of humans? Will you now test the patience of my God?"
Isaiah,7,14,"But the Lord will still show you this sign:
The young woman is pregnant
and will give birth to a son.
She will name him Immanuel."
Isaiah,7,15,"He will eat milk curds and honey
as he learns to choose good and refuse evil."
Isaiah,7,16,"But before he is old enough to make that choice,
the land of the two kings you fear will be empty."
Isaiah,7,17,“But the LORD will bring troubled times to you. These troubles will be worse than anything that has happened since the time Israel separated from Judah. This will happen to your people and to your father’s family when God brings the king of Assyria to fight against you.
Isaiah,7,18,"“At that time the LORD will call for the ‘Fly’ that is now near the streams of Egypt, and he will call for the ‘Bee’ that is now in the country of Assyria. Those enemies will come to your country."
Isaiah,7,19,"They will settle in the deep valleys and in the caves, by the thornbushes and watering holes."
Isaiah,7,20,The Lord will use Assyria to punish Judah. Assyria will be hired and used like a razor to shave off Judah’s beard and to remove the hair from his head and body.
Isaiah,7,21,“At that time someone might keep only one young cow and two sheep alive.
Isaiah,7,22,"But there will be enough milk for them to eat milk curds. In fact, everyone left in the country will eat milk curds and honey."
Isaiah,7,23,"There are now fields that have 1000 grapevines, and each grapevine is worth 1000 pieces of silver. But those fields will be covered with weeds and thorns."
Isaiah,7,24,That land will be wild and used only as a hunting ground where people go with bows and arrows.
Isaiah,7,25,"People once worked the soil and grew food on these hills, but at that time they will not go there, because the fields will be covered with weeds and thorns. It will be a place where cattle graze and sheep wander.”"
Isaiah,8,1,"The LORD told me, “Get a large scroll, and use an ordinary pen to write these words: ‘This is for Maher Shalal Hash Baz.’”"
Isaiah,8,2,I found some men who could be trusted to serve as witnesses: Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah. They watched me write those words.
Isaiah,8,3,"Then I went to my wife, the woman prophet. She became pregnant and had a son. The LORD told me, “Name the boy Maher Shalal Hash Baz.”"
Isaiah,8,4,"He said that because before the boy learns to say “Mama” and “Daddy,” God will take all the wealth and riches from Damascus and Samaria and give them to the king of Assyria."
Isaiah,8,5,The LORD spoke to me again.
Isaiah,8,6,"He said, “These people refuse to accept the slow-moving waters of Shiloah. They prefer Rezin and Remaliah’s son.”"
Isaiah,8,7,"But the Lord will bring the king of Assyria and all his power against them. The Assyrians will come like their swift moving river, like water that rises and spills over its banks."
Isaiah,8,8,"This water will be like a flash flood as it passes through Judah. It will rise to Judah’s throat and almost drown him.
But he will spread his wings over your whole country, Immanuel."
Isaiah,8,9,"All you nations, prepare for war.
You will be defeated.
Listen, all you faraway countries!
Prepare for battle.
You will be defeated."
Isaiah,8,10,"Make your plans for the fight.
Your plans will be defeated.
Give orders to your armies,
but your orders will be useless,
because God is with us!"
Isaiah,8,11,The LORD spoke to me with his great power and warned me not to be like these people. He said
Isaiah,8,12,“Don’t think there is a plan against you just because the people say there is. Don’t be afraid of what they fear. Don’t let them frighten you!”
Isaiah,8,13,The LORD All-Powerful is the one you should fear. He is the one you should respect. He is the one who should frighten you.
Isaiah,8,14,"If you people would respect him, he would be a safe place for you. But you don’t respect him, so he is like a stone that you stumble over. He is a rock that makes both families of Israel fall. He has become a trap that all the people of Jerusalem will fall into."
Isaiah,8,15,(Many people will trip over this rock. They will fall and be broken. They will be caught in the trap.)
Isaiah,8,16,"The Lord said, “Write this agreement. Tie it up and seal it so that it cannot be changed. Give these teachings to my followers for safekeeping.”"
Isaiah,8,17,"The LORD has turned away from the family of Jacob.
But I will wait for him.
I trust that he will come to save us."
Isaiah,8,18,"Here I am with the children the LORD has given me. We are here as signs from the has given me. We are here as signs from the LORD All-Powerful, who lives on Mount Zion. He is using us to show his plans for the people of Israel."
Isaiah,8,19,"The people will say, “Go to the fortunetellers and wizards who mumble and chirp like birds. Ask them what to do.” But I say, “Shouldn’t people go to their God for help? Why go to the dead to get help for the living?”"
Isaiah,8,20,"You should follow the teachings and the agreement. I swear, if you follow those other things, there is no future for you."
Isaiah,8,21,"When the enemy comes, there will be hard times and hunger. And when he becomes hungry, he will become angry. He will say curses in the name of his king and his gods. Then he will lift his head upwards like a roaring lion."
Isaiah,8,22,"And when the captives turn their faces to the ground, there is only a depressing darkness closing in—the dark sadness of people forced to leave their country."
Isaiah,9,1,"But there will be an end to the gloom those people suffered. In the past, people thought the land of Zebulun and Naphtali was not important. But later, that land will be honored—the land along the sea, the land east of the Jordan River, and Galilee where people from other nations live."
Isaiah,9,2,"Those people lived in darkness, but they will see a great light. They lived in a place as dark as death, but a great light will shine on them."
Isaiah,9,3,"God, you will make the nation grow, and you will make the people happy. They will rejoice in your presence as they do at harvest time. It will be like the joy when people take their share of things they have won in war."
Isaiah,9,4,"That will happen because you will lift the heavy yoke off their shoulders and take away their heavy burden. You will take away the rod that the enemy used to punish your people, as you did when you defeated Midian."
Isaiah,9,5,Every boot that marched in battle and every uniform stained with blood will be destroyed and thrown into the fire.
Isaiah,9,6,"This will happen when the special child is born. God will give us a son who will be responsible for leading the people. His name will be “Wonderful Counselor, Powerful God, Father Who Lives Forever, Prince of Peace.”"
Isaiah,9,7,"His power will continue to grow, and there will be peace without end. This will establish him as the king sitting on David’s throne and ruling his kingdom. He will rule with goodness and justice forever and ever. The strong love that the LORD All-Powerful has for his people will make this happen!"
Isaiah,9,8,The Lord gave a command against Jacob and someone in Israel fell.
Isaiah,9,9,"So all the people in Ephraim, including the ruler in Samaria, learned their lesson.
Those people are very proud and boastful now. They say"
Isaiah,9,10,"“Yes, those bricks fell, but we will rebuild with strong stone. Yes, those little trees were chopped down, but we will plant new trees. And they will be large, strong trees.”"
Isaiah,9,11,The LORD found people to go up and fight against Rezin. He stirred up Rezin’s enemies.
Isaiah,9,12,"As for Israel, the Arameans are in front of him and the Philistines are behind him. And they are both eating away at him. But the Lord is not finished yet. He is still angry, and his arm is raised to continue punishing Israel."
Isaiah,9,13,The people did not stop sinning. They did not come to the LORD All-Powerful for help.
Isaiah,9,14,So the LORD cut off Israel’s head and tail. He took away the branch and the stalk in one day.
Isaiah,9,15,(The head means the elders and important leaders. The tail means the prophets who told lies.)
Isaiah,9,16,"Their guides are leading them the wrong way, so those who follow them will be destroyed."
Isaiah,9,17,"All of them are evil. So the Lord is not happy with the young men, and he will not show mercy to their widows and orphans. That is because they are evil hypocrites. They tell lies.
The Lord has punished them, but he is not finished yet. He is still angry, and his arm is raised to continue punishing his people."
Isaiah,9,18,"That evil was like a small fire that started among the weeds and thorns and then spread to the larger bushes in the forest. Finally, it became a giant fire, and everything went up in smoke."
Isaiah,9,19,"The LORD All-Powerful was angry, so the land was burned. The people were fuel for the fire. No one showed any compassion to anyone else."
Isaiah,9,20,"People looked to the right and grabbed whatever they could, but they were still hungry. They grabbed whatever was on their left, but still they were not satisfied. So they turned on themselves and began to eat the bodies of their own children."
Isaiah,9,21,"Manasseh fought against Ephraim, and Ephraim fought against Manasseh. Then both of them turned on Judah.
But the Lord is not finished punishing his people. He is still angry, and his arm is raised to continue punishing them."
Isaiah,10,1,Just look at those lawmakers who write evil laws and make life hard for the people.
Isaiah,10,2,They are not fair to the poor. They take away the rights of the poor and allow people to steal from widows and orphans.
Isaiah,10,3,"Lawmakers, you will have to explain what you have done. What will you do then? Your destruction is coming from a faraway country. Where will you run for help? Your money and your riches will not help you."
Isaiah,10,4,"You will have to bow down like a prisoner. You will fall down like a dead man, but that will not help you. God will still be angry and ready to punish you."
Isaiah,10,5,"The Lord says, “I will use Assyria like a stick. In my anger I will use Assyria to punish Israel."
Isaiah,10,6,"I will send Assyria to fight against the people who do evil. I am angry with them, and I will command Assyria to fight against them. Assyria will defeat them and take their wealth. Israel will be like dirt for Assyria to walk on in the streets."
Isaiah,10,7,“But Assyria does not understand that I will use him. He does not think of himself as my tool. He only wants to destroy other people. He only plans to destroy many nations.
Isaiah,10,8,"Assyria says to himself, ‘All of my officers are like kings!"
Isaiah,10,9,"The city of Calno is no better than the city of Carchemish. Arpad is like Hamath, and Samaria is like Damascus."
Isaiah,10,10,I defeated those evil kingdoms and now I control them. The idols those people worship are better than the idols of Jerusalem and Samaria.
Isaiah,10,11,I defeated Samaria and her gods. I will also defeat Jerusalem and the idols her people have made.’”
Isaiah,10,12,"When the Lord finishes doing what he planned to Jerusalem and Mount Zion, he will punish Assyria. The king of Assyria is very proud. His pride made him do many bad things, so God will punish him."
Isaiah,10,13,"The king of Assyria said, “I am very wise. By my own wisdom and power I have done many great things. I have defeated many nations. I have taken their wealth and their people as slaves. I am a very powerful man."
Isaiah,10,14,"With my own hands I have taken the riches of all these people—like someone taking eggs from a bird’s nest. A bird often leaves its nest and eggs, and there is nothing to protect the nest. There is no bird to chirp and fight with its wings and beak, so anyone can come take the eggs. And there is no one to stop me from taking all the people on earth.”"
Isaiah,10,15,An ax is not better than the one who cuts with it. A saw is not better than the one who uses it. Is a stick stronger than the one who picks it up? It can’t do anything to the person who is using it to punish someone!
Isaiah,10,16,But Assyria doesn’t understand this. So the Lord GOD All-Powerful will send a terrible disease against him. He will lose his wealth and power like a sick man losing weight. Then Assyria’s glory will be destroyed. It will be like a fire burning until everything is gone.
Isaiah,10,17,The Light of Israel will be like a fire. The Holy One will be like a flame. He will be like a fire that first begins to burn the weeds and thorns
Isaiah,10,18,"and then spreads to burn up the tall trees and vineyards. Finally, everything will be destroyed—even the people. Assyria will be like a rotting log."
Isaiah,10,19,There will be a few trees left standing in the forest—so few that even a child could count them.
Isaiah,10,20,"Then the people from Jacob’s family who are left living in Israel will stop depending on the one who beat them. They will learn to depend on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,10,21,Those who are left in Jacob’s family will again follow the Powerful God.
Isaiah,10,22,"Israel, your people are as many as the sands of the sea, but only a few of them will be left to come back to God. But before that happens, your country will be destroyed. God has announced that he will destroy the land. And then justice will come into the land like a river flowing full."
Isaiah,10,23,The Lord GOD All-Powerful really will destroy this land.
Isaiah,10,24,"The Lord GOD All-Powerful says, “My people living in Zion, don’t be afraid of Assyria! Yes, he will beat you, and it will be just as the time when Egypt beat you with a stick."
Isaiah,10,25,But after a short time my anger will stop. I will be satisfied that Assyria has punished you enough.”
Isaiah,10,26,"Then the LORD All-Powerful will beat Assyria with a whip, just as he defeated Midian at Raven Rock. He will punish his enemies, as he did when he raised his stick over the sea and led his people from Egypt."
Isaiah,10,27,He will take away the troubles Assyria brought you—troubles that are like heavy weights carried with a yoke on your neck. But that yoke will be taken off your neck. The burden will be lifted from your shoulders.
Isaiah,10,28,The army of Assyria will enter near the “Ruins” (Aiath). The army will walk on the “Threshing Floor” (Migron). It will keep its food in the “Storehouse” (Micmash).
Isaiah,10,29,The army will cross the river at the “Crossing” (Maabarah) and sleep at Geba. Ramah will be afraid. The people at Gibeah of Saul will run away.
Isaiah,10,30,"Cry out, Bath Gallim! Laishah, listen! Anathoth, answer me!"
Isaiah,10,31,The people of Madmenah are running away. The people of Gebim are hiding.
Isaiah,10,32,"This day the army will stop at Nob and prepare to fight against Mount Zion, the hill of Jerusalem."
Isaiah,10,33,"Look, the Lord GOD All-Powerful will use his great power and chop down that great tree. Their highest officials will be brought down. Their most important leaders will be humbled."
Isaiah,10,34,God will cut down his enemies. Like the tall trees of Lebanon he will cut them down with an ax.
Isaiah,11,1,A small tree will begin to grow from the stump of Jesse. That branch will grow from Jesse’s roots.
Isaiah,11,2,"The LORD’s Spirit will always be with that new king to give him wisdom, understanding, guidance, and power. The Spirit will help him know and respect the ’s Spirit will always be with that new king to give him wisdom, understanding, guidance, and power. The Spirit will help him know and respect the LORD."
Isaiah,11,3,"He will find joy in obeying the LORD.
This king will not judge people by the way things look. He will not judge by listening to rumors."
Isaiah,11,4,"He will judge the poor fairly and honestly. He will be fair when he decides what to do for the poor of the land. If he decides people should be beaten, he will give the command, and they will be beaten. If he decides people must die, he will give the command, and those evil people will be killed. Goodness and fairness will be like a belt he wears around his waist."
Isaiah,11,5,"He will judge the poor fairly and honestly. He will be fair when he decides what to do for the poor of the land. If he decides people should be beaten, he will give the command, and they will be beaten. If he decides people must die, he will give the command, and those evil people will be killed. Goodness and fairness will be like a belt he wears around his waist."
Isaiah,11,6,"Then wolves will live at peace with lambs, and leopards will lie down in peace with young goats. Calves, lions, and bulls will all live together in peace. A little child will lead them."
Isaiah,11,7,"Bears and cattle will eat together in peace, and all their young will lie down together and will not hurt each other. Lions will eat hay like cattle."
Isaiah,11,8,Even snakes will not hurt people. Babies will be able to play near a cobra’s hole and put their hands into the nest of a poisonous snake.
Isaiah,11,9,"People will stop hurting each other. People on my holy mountain will not want to destroy things because they will know the LORD. The world will be full of knowledge about him, like the sea is full of water."
Isaiah,11,10,At that time there will be someone special from Jesse’s family. He will be like a flag that all the nations gather around. The nations will come to him and ask him what they should do. And the place where he is will be filled with glory.
Isaiah,11,11,"At that time the Lord will again reach out and take his people who are left in countries like Assyria, North Egypt, South Egypt, Ethiopia, Elam, Babylonia, Hamath, and other faraway countries around the world."
Isaiah,11,12,"He will gather the people of Israel and Judah who were forced to leave their country. They were scattered to all the faraway places on earth. But he will raise the flag as a sign for the other nations, and he will gather his people together again."
Isaiah,11,13,"Then Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah, and Judah will have no enemies left. And Judah will not cause trouble for Ephraim."
Isaiah,11,14,"But Ephraim and Judah will attack the Philistines. These two nations will be like birds flying down to catch a small animal. Together, they will take the riches from the people in the East. Ephraim and Judah will control Edom, Moab, and the people in Ammon."
Isaiah,11,15,"Just as the LORD divided the Red Sea near Egypt, he will raise his arm in anger over the Euphrates River and hit it. It will divide into seven small rivers. They will be so small that the people can walk across with their sandals on."
Isaiah,11,16,Then God’s people who are left in Assyria will have a way to leave. It will be just like the time God took the people out of Egypt.
Isaiah,12,1,"At that time you will say,
“I praise you, LORD!
You have been angry with me,
but don’t be angry with me now.
Show your love to me."
Isaiah,12,2,"God is the one who saves me.
I trust him, and I am not afraid.
The LORD YAH is my strength.
He saves me, and I sing songs of praise about him.”"
Isaiah,12,3,"You people will get your water from the spring of salvation.
Then you will be happy."
Isaiah,12,4,"At that time you will say,
“Praise the LORD and call out his name!
Tell everyone what he has done
and how wonderful he is.”"
Isaiah,12,5,"Sing songs of praise about the LORD,
because he has done great things.
Spread this news about God throughout the whole world.
Let all people know these things."
Isaiah,12,6,"People of Zion, shout about these things!
The Holy One of Israel is with you in a powerful way.
So sing and be happy!"
Isaiah,13,1,God showed Isaiah son of Amoz this message about Babylon
Isaiah,13,2,"“Raise a flag on that mountain where nothing grows.
Call out to the men.
Wave your arms to let them know
they should enter through the gates for important leaders."
Isaiah,13,3,"“I have separated these men from the people,
and I myself will command them.
I have gathered these proud, happy soldiers of mine
to show how angry I am."
Isaiah,13,4,"“Listen to that loud noise in the mountains.
It sounds like crowds of people.
People from many kingdoms are gathering together.
The LORD All-Powerful is calling his army together."
Isaiah,13,5,"They are coming from a faraway land.
They are coming from beyond the horizon.
The LORD will use this army as a weapon to show his anger.
They will destroy the whole country.”"
Isaiah,13,6,The LORD’s special day is near. So cry and be sad for yourselves. A time is coming when the enemy will steal your wealth. God All-Powerful will make that happen.
Isaiah,13,7,People will lose their courage. Fear will make them weak.
Isaiah,13,8,Everyone will be afraid. They will stare at each other with shock on their faces. Fear will grip them like the pains of a woman in childbirth.
Isaiah,13,9,"Look, the LORD’s special day is coming! It will be a terrible day. God will be very angry. He will destroy the country and wipe out the sinful people who live there."
Isaiah,13,10,"The skies will be dark. The sun, the moon, and the stars will not shine."
Isaiah,13,11,"The Lord says, “I will cause bad things to happen to the world. I will punish the evil people for their sin. I will make proud people lose their pride. I will stop the bragging of cruel people."
Isaiah,13,12,There will be only a few people left. They will be as rare as pure gold.
Isaiah,13,13,"In my anger I will shake the sky, and the earth will be moved from its place.”
That will happen on the day the LORD All-Powerful shows his anger."
Isaiah,13,14,Then the people from Babylon will run away like wounded deer or sheep that have no shepherd. Everyone will turn and run back to their own country and people.
Isaiah,13,15,Anyone caught by the enemy will be killed with a sword.
Isaiah,13,16,"Everything in their houses will be stolen. Their wives will be raped, and their little children will be beaten to death while they watch."
Isaiah,13,17,"The Lord says, “Look, I will cause the armies of Media to attack Babylon. Nothing will stop them, even if someone offers them gold and silver."
Isaiah,13,18,They will walk on the bows of the young soldiers of Babylon. The enemy soldiers will not show any kindness or mercy even to the babies and young children.
Isaiah,13,19,"Babylon will be destroyed like the time God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.
“Babylon is the most beautiful of all kingdoms. The Babylonians are very proud of their city."
Isaiah,13,20,But Babylon will not continue to be beautiful. People will not continue to live there in the future. Arabs will not put their tents there. Shepherds will not bring their sheep to let them eat there.
Isaiah,13,21,The only animals living there will be wild animals from the desert. People will not be living in their houses in Babylon. The houses will be full of owls and large birds. Wild goats will play in the houses.
Isaiah,13,22,"Wild dogs and wolves will howl in the great and beautiful buildings. Babylon will be finished. The end is near, and it will not be delayed.”"
Isaiah,14,1,"The LORD will again show his love to Jacob. He will again choose the people of Israel. He will give them their land. Then the non-Israelites will join the Israelites, and both will become one family—Jacob’s family."
Isaiah,14,2,"Those nations will bring the Israelites back to their land. The men and women from the other nations will become slaves to Israel. In the past, those people forced the Israelites to become their slaves. But in the future the Israelites will defeat those nations, and Israel will then rule over them in the LORD’s land."
Isaiah,14,3,"In the past, you were slaves. People forced you to work hard. But the LORD will take away the hard work you were forced to do."
Isaiah,14,4,"At that time you will begin to sing this song about the king of Babylon:
The king was cruel when he ruled us,
but now his rule is finished."
Isaiah,14,5,"The LORD breaks the scepter of evil rulers;
he takes away their power."
Isaiah,14,6,"In anger, the king of Babylon beat the people.
He never stopped beating them.
He was an evil ruler who ruled in anger.
He never stopped hurting people."
Isaiah,14,7,"But now, the whole country rests and is quiet.
Now the people begin to celebrate."
Isaiah,14,8,"You were an evil king,
and now you are finished.
Even the pine trees are happy.
The cedar trees of Lebanon rejoice.
They say, “The king chopped us down,
but now the king has fallen,
and he will never stand again.”"
Isaiah,14,9,"The place of death is excited
that you are coming.
Sheol is waking the spirits
of all the leaders of the earth for you.
Sheol is making the kings stand up
from their thrones to meet you."
Isaiah,14,10,"They will make fun of you, saying,
“Now you are as dead as we are.
Now you are just like us.”"
Isaiah,14,11,"Your pride has been sent down to Sheol.
The music from your harps announces the coming of your proud spirit.
Maggots will be the bed you lie on,
and other worms will cover your body like a blanket."
Isaiah,14,12,"You were like the morning star,
but you have fallen from the sky.
In the past, all the nations on earth bowed down before you,
but now you have been cut down."

“I will go to the skies above.
I will put my throne above God’s stars.
I will sit on Zaphon, the holy mountain where the gods meet."
Isaiah,14,14,"I will go up to the altar above the tops of the clouds.
I will be like God Most High.”"
Isaiah,14,15,"But that did not happen.
You were brought down to the deep pit—Sheol, the place of death."
Isaiah,14,16,"People will come to look at your dead body.
They will think about you and say,
“Is this the same man
who caused great fear in all the kingdoms on earth"
Isaiah,14,17,"who destroyed cities
and turned the land into a desert,
who captured people in war
and would not let them go home?”"
Isaiah,14,18,"The kings of other nations lie buried with honor,
each king with his own grave."
Isaiah,14,19,"But you were thrown out of your grave
like a branch cut from a tree and thrown away.
You are like a dead man who fell in battle,
trampled under the feet of other soldiers.
Now you look like any other dead man
wrapped in burial clothes."
Isaiah,14,20,"Other kings have their own graves,
but you will not join them,
because you ruined your own country
and killed your own people.
So your wicked descendants will be stopped."
Isaiah,14,21,"Prepare to kill his children,
because their father is guilty.
His children will never take control of the land.
They will never fill the world with their cities."
Isaiah,14,22,"The LORD All-Powerful said, “I will stand and fight against those people. I will destroy the famous city, Babylon. I will destroy all the people there. I will destroy their children, their grandchildren, and their great-grandchildren.” The All-Powerful said, “I will stand and fight against those people. I will destroy the famous city, Babylon. I will destroy all the people there. I will destroy their children, their grandchildren, and their great-grandchildren.” The LORD himself said this."
Isaiah,14,23,"“I will change Babylon. It will be a place for animals, not people. It will be a swamp. I will use the ‘broom of destruction’ to sweep Babylon away.” The LORD All-Powerful said this."
Isaiah,14,24,The LORD All-Powerful made this promise: “This will happen exactly as I meant for it to happen. It will happen just the way I planned.
Isaiah,14,25,"I will destroy the king of Assyria in my country. I will walk on him on my mountains. He forced my people to be his slaves; he put a yoke on their necks. But that pole will be taken off Judah’s neck, and that burden will be removed."
Isaiah,14,26,This is what I plan to do for this land. I will use my power to punish all those nations.”
Isaiah,14,27,"When the LORD All-Powerful makes a plan, no one can change it. When he raises his arm to punish, no one can stop him."
Isaiah,14,28,This message was given to me the year King Ahaz died
Isaiah,14,29,"Country of Philistia, don’t be happy that the king who beat you is now dead. It is true that his rule has ended, but his son will come and rule. It will be like one snake giving birth to a more dangerous one. The new king will be like a quick and dangerous snake to you."
Isaiah,14,30,"But even the poorest of my people will be able to eat safely. And their children will be able to lie down and feel safe. But I will make your family die from hunger, and your enemy will kill anyone who survives."
Isaiah,14,31,"People near the city gates, cry!
People in the city, cry out!
Everyone in Philistia,
your courage will melt like hot wax.
Look to the north!
There is a cloud of dust.
An army is coming,
and everyone in that army is strong."

They will say, “The LORD made Zion strong,
and his poor people went there for safety.”"

people are wearing sackcloth.
Everyone is crying."
Isaiah,15,4,"In Heshbon and Elealeh they are crying loudly.
You can hear their voices as far away as Jahaz.
Even the soldiers are frightened.
They are shaking with fear."
Isaiah,15,5,"My heart cries, full of sorrow for Moab.
Its people run away to Zoar for safety.
They run to Eglath Shelishiyah.
The people are crying
as they go up the road to Luhith.
They are crying loudly
as they walk on the road to Horonaim."
Isaiah,15,6,"But Nimrim Brook is as dry as a desert.

He will be loyal, loving, and kind.

He will do what is right and good."

are very proud and conceited.
They are hot-tempered braggers,
but their boasts are only empty words."
Isaiah,16,7,"Because of their pride, everyone in Moab will mourn.
They will wish for the way things used to be.
They will wish for the raisin cakes from Kir Hareseth."
Isaiah,16,8,"The fields of Heshbon and the vines of Sibmah no longer grow grapes.
Foreign rulers have destroyed the vines.
The enemy has reached Jazer
and has spread into the desert and down to the sea."
Isaiah,16,9,"I will cry with the people of Jazer and Sibmah,

There will be no summer fruit,
and there will be no shouts of joy for the harvest."

Yes, Israel will be like a sick man who has become weak and thin."

Isaiah,17,11,"You will plant your grapevines one day and try to make them grow, and the next day they will blossom. But at harvest time, you will go to gather the fruit from the plants, and you will see that everything is dead. A sickness will kill all the plants."
Isaiah,17,12,"Listen to all these people!
Their loud crying sounds like the noise from the sea.
Listen, it is like the crashing of waves in the sea."

Isaiah,18,2,"That land sends people down the Nile River in reed boats.

who are feared far and wide.

everyone on earth will see what happens.
Like a trumpet call,
everyone in the country will hear it."

and made it a place for wild animals."
Isaiah,23,14,"So be sad, you ships from Tarshish.
Your place of safety has been destroyed."

take your harp and walk through the city.
Play your song well and sing it often.
Maybe someone will remember you.”"

Isaiah,23,18,But Tyre will not keep the money she earns. The profit from her trade will be saved for the LORD. Tyre will give that money to the people who serve the . Tyre will give that money to the people who serve the LORD to buy good food and nice clothes.
Isaiah,24,1,"Look, the LORD is destroying this land. He will clean out the land completely and force all the people to go far away."

People in faraway lands,
praise the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.”"
Isaiah,24,16,"We hear songs of praise for God from every place on earth.

the heavenly armies in heaven
and the earthly kings on earth."

I honor you and praise your name,
because you did amazing things.
The words you said long ago are completely true;
everything happened exactly as you said it would."

Powerful people from strong cities will fear you."
Isaiah,25,4,"You have been a safe place for poor people in trouble.
You are like a shelter from floods and shade from the heat
when powerful men attack.
They are like rain streaming down the walls
that protect us from the storm."

the angry shouts of those foreigners brought us to our knees.
But like a thick cloud that blocks the summer heat,
you answered their challenge."

Isaiah,25,9,"At that time people will say,

with each stroke they take."

and easy to follow."

and the spirit in me wants to be with you at the dawn of every new day.
When your way of justice comes to the world,
people will learn the right way of living."
Isaiah,26,10,"Evil people will not learn to do good,
even if you show them only kindness.
They will still do wrong, even if they live in a good world.
They never see the LORD’s greatness."

but they don’t see it.
Show them how strong your love is for your people.
Then those who are evil will be ashamed.
Yes, your fire will destroy your enemies."

so give us peace."

and you destroyed everything that makes us think about them."

You made our nation grow
and brought honor to yourself."

when they are in trouble.
So because of your punishment,
we called out to you."
Isaiah,26,17,"LORD, because of you we were in pain,
like a woman giving birth,
who struggles and cries out when it is time."
Isaiah,26,18,"But we struggled in pain for nothing.
We gave birth only to wind.
We did nothing to save the land.
No one was born to live in the world."
Isaiah,26,19,"But the Lord says,
“Your people have died,
but they will live again.
The bodies of my people
will rise from death.

stand and be happy!
The dew covering you is like
the dew sparkling in the light of a new day.
It shows that a new time is coming,
when the earth will give birth to the dead who are in it.”"

and lock your doors.

until God’s anger is finished."

to judge the people of the world for the bad things they have done.
The earth will reveal the blood that has been spilled on it.
It will no longer hide the proof of those murders."
Isaiah,27,1,"At that time the LORD will judge Leviathan,
the crooked snake.
He will use his great sword, his hard and powerful sword,
to punish Leviathan, that twisting, turning snake.
He will kill the monster of the sea."
Isaiah,27,2,"At that time people will sing
about the pleasant vineyard."
Isaiah,27,3,"“I, the LORD, will care for the vineyard.
I will water it at the right time.
I will guard it day and night.
No one will hurt it."
Isaiah,27,4,"I am not angry.
But if there is war and someone builds a wall of thornbushes,
then I will march to it and burn it."

Then Israel will sprout and bloom,
and the world will be filled with his fruit.”"

Isaiah,27,9,How will Jacob’s guilt be forgiven? What will happen so his sins can be taken away? The rocks of the altar will be crushed to dust; the statues and altars for worshiping false gods will all be destroyed.
Isaiah,27,10,The great city will be empty; it will be like a desert. All the people will be gone—they will run away. The city will be like an open pasture. Young cattle will eat grass there. The cattle will eat leaves from the branches of the vines.
Isaiah,27,11,"The vines will become dry, and the branches will break off. Women will use them for firewood.
The people refuse to understand. So God, their Maker, will not comfort them or be kind to them."
Isaiah,27,12,"At that time the LORD will begin separating his people from others. He will begin at the Euphrates River and will gather his people from there to the River of Egypt.
You people of Israel will be gathered together one by one."
Isaiah,27,13,"Many of my people are now lost in Assyria. Some of my people have run away to Egypt. But at that time a great trumpet will be blown, and all those people will come back to Jerusalem. They will bow down before the LORD on that holy mountain."
Isaiah,28,1,"Look at Samaria!
The drunks of Ephraim are proud of that city.
It sits on a hill with a rich valley around it.
The Samarians think their city is a beautiful crown of flowers.
But they are drunk with wine,
and this “beautiful crown” is just a dying plant."
Isaiah,28,2,"Look, the Lord has someone who is strong and brave.
He will come into the country like a storm of hail and rain.
Like a powerful river of water flooding the country,
he will throw that crown down to the ground."
Isaiah,28,3,"The drunks of Ephraim are proud of their beautiful crown,
but that city will be trampled down."
Isaiah,28,4,"That city sits on a hill with a rich valley around it.
But that beautiful crown of flowers is just a dying plant.
It will be like the first figs of summer.
As soon as someone sees a ripe one, they pick it and eat it."
Isaiah,28,5,At that time the LORD All-Powerful will become the “Beautiful Crown.” He will be the “Wonderful Crown of Flowers” for his people who are left.
Isaiah,28,6,Then he will give wisdom to the judges who rule his people. He will give strength to the people who are in battles at the city gates.
Isaiah,28,7,But now those leaders are drunk. The priests and prophets are all drunk with wine and beer. They stumble and fall down. The prophets are drunk when they see their dreams. The judges are drunk when they make their decisions.
Isaiah,28,8,Every table is covered with vomit. There is not a clean place anywhere.
Isaiah,28,9,"The people say, “Who does he think he is trying to teach and explain his message to? Does he think we are babies who were at their mother’s breast only a very short time ago?"
Isaiah,28,10,"He speaks to us as though we were babies:
“Saw lasaw saw lasaw
Qaw laqaw qaw laqaw
Ze’er sham ze’er sham.”"
Isaiah,28,11,"So God will use this strange way of talking, and he will use other languages to speak to these people."
Isaiah,28,12,"In the past he spoke to them and said, “Here is a resting place. Let those who are tired come and rest. This is the place of peace.”
But they would not listen to him."
Isaiah,28,13,"So the LORD’s words will be senseless sounds to them:
“Saw lasaw saw lasaw.
Qaw laqaw qaw laqaw.
Ze’er sham ze’er sham.”
When the people try to walk, they will fall backwards. They will be defeated, trapped, and captured."
Isaiah,28,14,"You leaders in Jerusalem should listen to the LORD’s message, but now you refuse to listen to him."
Isaiah,28,15,"You have said, “We have made an agreement with death. We have a contract with death. So we will not be punished. Punishment will pass us without hurting us. We will hide behind our tricks and lies.”"
Isaiah,28,16,"Because of these things, the Lord GOD says, “I will put a rock—a cornerstone—in the ground in Zion. This will be a very precious stone. Everything will be built on this very important rock. Anyone who trusts in that rock will not be disappointed."
Isaiah,28,17,“Workers use a string and weight to show their work is straight and true. I will use justice as the string and goodness as the weight when I lay that foundation. But your safe places were built on lies. So they will be destroyed and washed away when the troubles come against you like hail storms and floods.
Isaiah,28,18,"Your agreement with death will be erased. Your contract with Sheol will not help you.
“Someone will come and punish you. He will make you like the dirt he walks on."
Isaiah,28,19,"He will come and take you away. Your punishment will be terrible. Your punishment will come early in the morning, and it will continue late into the night.
“Then you will understand this story"
Isaiah,28,20,"A man tried to sleep on a bed that was too short for him. He had a blanket that was not wide enough to cover him. The bed and blanket were useless, and so were your agreements.”"
Isaiah,28,21,"The LORD will fight as he did at Mount Perazim. He will be angry as he was in Gibeon Valley. He will do what he must do. It will be what some stranger should do, but he will finish his work. Yes, this is a stranger’s job."
Isaiah,28,22,"Now don’t complain about these things. If you fight against them, you will only tighten the ropes around you.
The words I heard will not change. They came from the Lord GOD All-Powerful, the ruler of all the earth, and these things will be done."
Isaiah,28,23,Listen closely to the message I am telling you.
Isaiah,28,24,"Does a farmer plow his field all the time? No, he doesn’t work the soil all the time."
Isaiah,28,25,"A farmer prepares the ground, and then he plants the seed. He plants different kinds of seeds different ways. He scatters dill seeds, he throws cumin seeds on the ground, and he plants wheat in rows. A farmer plants barley in its special place, and he plants spelt seeds at the edge of his field."
Isaiah,28,26,Our God is using this to teach you a lesson. This example shows us that God is fair when he punishes his people.
Isaiah,28,27,"Does a farmer use large boards with sharp teeth to crush dill seeds? No, and he doesn’t use a wagon to crush cumin seeds. A farmer uses a small stick to break the hulls from these seeds of grain."
Isaiah,28,28,"People grind grain to make flour, but they don’t grind it forever. As God does in punishing people, a worker might drive his wagon over the grain to remove the hulls, but he does not allow the horses to crush it."
Isaiah,28,29,"This lesson comes from the LORD All-Powerful, who gives wonderful advice. He is very wise."
Isaiah,29,1,"God says, “Look at Ariel, the city where David camped. Keep on having your festivals, year after year."
Isaiah,29,2,"But I will punish Ariel. The city will be filled with sadness and crying, but it will always be my Ariel."
Isaiah,29,3,"“I will put armies all around you, Ariel. I will raise war towers against you."
Isaiah,29,4,You will be pulled to the ground. Your voice will rise from the ground like the voice of a ghost. Your words come like a whisper from the dirt.”
Isaiah,29,5,There will be so many foreigners that they will be like dust. Cruel people will be like the chaff blowing in the wind. Then suddenly
Isaiah,29,6,"the LORD All-Powerful will punish you with earthquakes, thunder, and loud noises. There will be storms, strong winds, and a burning, destructive fire."
Isaiah,29,7,Many nations will fight against Ariel. It will be a nightmare. Armies will surround Ariel and punish her.
Isaiah,29,8,"But it will also be like a dream to those armies. They will not get what they want. It will be like a hungry man dreaming about food. When the man wakes up, he is still hungry. It will be like a thirsty man dreaming about water. When the man wakes up, he is still thirsty. The same thing is true about all the nations fighting against Zion. Those nations will not get what they want."
Isaiah,29,9,"Be surprised and amazed!
You will become drunk, but not from wine.
Look and be amazed!
You will stumble and fall, but not from beer."
Isaiah,29,10,"The LORD will make you sleepy.
He will close your eyes. (The prophets are your eyes.)
He will cover your heads. (The prophets are your heads.)"
Isaiah,29,11,"To you my words are like the words in a book that is closed and sealed. You can give the book to someone who can read and tell that person to read it. But that person will say, “I cannot read the book. It is closed and I cannot open it.”"
Isaiah,29,12,"Or you can give the book to someone who cannot read and tell that person to read it. That person will say, “I cannot read the book because I don’t know how to read.”"
Isaiah,29,13,"The Lord says, “These people come to honor me with words, but I am not really important to them. The worship they give me is nothing but human rules they have memorized."
Isaiah,29,14,So I will continue to amaze them by doing powerful and amazing things. Their wise men will lose their wisdom. Even the most intelligent among them will not be able to understand.”
Isaiah,29,15,Look at them! They try to hide things from the LORD. They think he will not understand. They do their evil things in darkness. They tell themselves: “No one can see us. No one will know who we are.”
Isaiah,29,16,"You turn things upside down. You think the clay is equal to the potter. You think that something that is made can tell the one who made it, “You did not make me!” This is like a pot telling its maker, “You know nothing.”"
Isaiah,29,17,"This is the truth: After a very short time, Lebanon will become rich farmland, and the farmland will be like thick forests."
Isaiah,29,18,The deaf will hear the words in the book. The blind will see through the darkness and fog.
Isaiah,29,19,The LORD will make poor people happy. The poorest people will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah,29,20,This will happen when the people who are mean and cruel have come to an end. It will happen when those who enjoy doing bad things are gone.
Isaiah,29,21,(They lie about good people. They try to trap people in court. They try to destroy innocent people.)
Isaiah,29,22,"So the LORD, who made Abraham free, speaks to Jacob’s family. He says, “Now the people of Jacob will not be embarrassed and ashamed."
Isaiah,29,23,"Yes, when they see all their children, the children I myself have made for them, they will honor my name as holy. They will honor the Holy One of Jacob, and they will respect the God of Israel."
Isaiah,29,24,"Many of these people did not understand, so they did what was wrong. They complained, but now they will learn their lesson.”"
Isaiah,30,1,"The LORD said, “Look at these children. They don’t obey me. They make plans, but they don’t ask me to help them. They make agreements with other nations, but my Spirit does not want those agreements. These people are adding more and more sins to the ones they have already done."
Isaiah,30,2,"They are going down to Egypt for help, but they did not ask me if that was the right thing to do. They hope they will be saved by the Pharaoh. They want Egypt to protect them."
Isaiah,30,3,"“But I tell you, hiding in Egypt will not help you. Pharaoh will not be able to protect you."
Isaiah,30,4,"Your leaders have gone to Zoan, and your representatives have gone to Hanes."
Isaiah,30,5,But they will be disappointed. They are depending on a nation that cannot help them. Egypt is useless—it will not help. Egypt will bring nothing but shame and embarrassment.”
Isaiah,30,6,"This is a message about the Negev animals:
There is a dangerous place full of lions, adders, deadly snakes, and useless people. And there are people who load their wealth onto donkeys and their treasures on the backs of camels. They carry them to a people who cannot help."
Isaiah,30,7,"That useless nation is Egypt. Egypt’s help is worth nothing, so I call Egypt the “Do-Nothing Dragon.”"
Isaiah,30,8,"Now write this on a sign so that all people can see it, and write this in a book. Write these things for a future time. This will be far, far in the future"
Isaiah,30,9,These people are like children who refuse to obey. They lie and refuse to listen to the LORD’s teachings.
Isaiah,30,10,"They tell the prophets, “Don’t see dreams about things we should do. Don’t tell us the truth. Say nice things to us and make us feel good. See only good things for us."
Isaiah,30,11,Stop seeing things that will really happen. Get out of our way. Stop telling us about the Holy One of Israel.”
Isaiah,30,12,"The Holy One of Israel says, “You people have refused to accept this message from me. You depend on fighting and lies to help you."
Isaiah,30,13,You are guilty of these things. So you are like a tall wall with cracks in it. That wall will fall and break into small pieces.
Isaiah,30,14,"You will be like a large clay jar that breaks into many small, useless pieces. You cannot use them to get a hot coal from the fire or to get water from a pool in the ground.”"
Isaiah,30,15,"The Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, says, “If you come back to me you will be saved. Only by remaining calm and trusting in me can you be strong.”
But you don’t want to do that."
Isaiah,30,16,"You say, “No, we need fast horses for battle.” That is true—you will need fast horses, but only to run away because your enemy will be faster than your horses."
Isaiah,30,17,"One enemy soldier will make threats, and a thousand of your men will run away. And when five of them make threats, all of you will run away. The only thing that will be left of your army will be a flagpole on a hill."
Isaiah,30,18,"So the LORD is waiting to show his mercy to you. He wants to rise and comfort you. The is waiting to show his mercy to you. He wants to rise and comfort you. The LORD is the God who does the right thing, so he will bless everyone who waits for his help."
Isaiah,30,19,"You people who live in Jerusalem on Mount Zion will not continue crying. The Lord will hear your crying, and he will comfort you. When he hears you, he will help you."
Isaiah,30,20,"The Lord might give you sorrow and pain like the bread and water you eat every day. But God is your teacher, and he will not continue to hide from you. You will see your teacher with your own eyes."
Isaiah,30,21,"If you wander from the right path, either to the right or to the left, you will hear a voice behind you saying, “You should go this way. Here is the right way.”"
Isaiah,30,22,"Then you will take your idols covered with gold and silver and make them unfit to be used again. You will throw them away like filthy rags and say, “Go away!”"
Isaiah,30,23,"At that time the Lord will send you rain. You will plant seeds, and the ground will grow food for you. You will have a very large harvest. You will have plenty of food in the fields for your animals. There will be large fields for your sheep."
Isaiah,30,24,Your cattle and donkeys will have all the food they need. There will be much food. You will have to use shovels and pitchforks to spread all the food for your animals to eat.
Isaiah,30,25,Every mountain and hill will have streams filled with water. These things will happen after many people are killed and the enemy’s towers are pulled down.
Isaiah,30,26,"At that time the light from the moon will be as bright as the sun, and the light from the sun will be seven times brighter than it is now. One day of sunlight will be like a whole week’s worth. This will happen when the LORD bandages his broken people and heals the hurts from their beatings."
Isaiah,30,27,"Look! The LORD is coming from far away. His anger is like a fire with thick clouds of smoke. His mouth is filled with anger, and his tongue is like a burning fire."
Isaiah,30,28,His breath is like a great river that rises until it reaches the throat. He will judge the nations as if putting them through a strainer that separates the ones fit for destruction. He will put a bit in their mouths to lead them to the place they don’t want to go.
Isaiah,30,29,"You will sing happy songs, like the nights when you begin a festival. You will be very happy walking to the LORD’s mountain and listening to the flute on the way to worship the Rock of Israel."
Isaiah,30,30,The LORD will cause all people to hear his great voice and to see his powerful arm come down in anger. That arm will be like a great fire that burns everything. His power will be like a great storm with much rain and hail.
Isaiah,30,31,Assyria will be frightened by the LORD’s voice and the stick that will beat him.
Isaiah,30,32,"And as the LORD beats Assyria, his people will keep the rhythm with their drums and harps."
Isaiah,30,33,"Topheth has been made ready for a long time. It is ready for the king. It was made very deep and wide. There is a very big pile of wood and fire there, and the LORD’s breath will come like a stream of burning sulfur to start the fire."
Isaiah,31,1,Look at the people going down to Egypt for help. They think the horses they get will save them. They hope the many chariots and powerful soldiers will protect them. But the people don’t trust the Holy One of Israel. They didn’t ask the LORD for help.
Isaiah,31,2,But he is the wise one who is bringing the disaster. And they will not be able to stop what he commanded. The Lord will attack those who are evil and all who try to help them.
Isaiah,31,3,"The Egyptians are only human, not God. The horses from Egypt are only animals, not spirit. The LORD will stretch out his arm, and the helper will be defeated. And those who wanted help will fall. They will all be destroyed together."
Isaiah,31,4,"The LORD told me: “When a lion or its cub catches an animal to eat, the lion stands over the dead animal and roars, and nothing can frighten it away. If men come and yell at the lion, the lion will not be afraid. They might make a lot of noise, but the lion will not run away.”
In the same way, the LORD All-Powerful will come down to Mount Zion. He will fight on that hill."
Isaiah,31,5,"Just as birds fly over their nest to protect it, so the LORD All-Powerful will defend Jerusalem. He will save her. He will “pass over” and save Jerusalem."
Isaiah,31,6,"People of Israel, you should come back to the God you turned away from."
Isaiah,31,7,"That is because when those things happen, people will reject the gold and silver idols you made when you sinned against me."
Isaiah,31,8,"It is true that Assyria will be defeated with a sword, but it will not be a human sword that defeats him. Assyria will be destroyed, but that destruction will not come from a man’s sword. Assyria will run away from God’s sword, but the young men will be caught and made slaves."
Isaiah,31,9,"Their place of safety will be destroyed. Their leaders will be defeated, and they will abandon their flag.
The LORD, whose fireplace is on Zion and whose oven is in Jerusalem, is the one who said this."
Isaiah,32,1,Listen to what I say! A king should rule in a way that brings justice. Leaders should make fair decisions when they lead the people.
Isaiah,32,2,"If this would happen, the king would be like a shelter to hide from the wind and rain, like streams of water in a dry land, and like the cool shadow of a large rock in a hot land."
Isaiah,32,3,Then people would actually see what they look at. They would actually listen to what they hear.
Isaiah,32,4,People who are now confused would be able to understand. Those who cannot speak clearly now would be able to speak clearly and quickly.
Isaiah,32,5,Fools would not be called great men. People would not respect men who make secret plans.
Isaiah,32,6,"Fools say foolish things, and in their minds they plan evil things to do. They want to do what is wrong. They say bad things about the LORD. They don’t let hungry people eat their food. They don’t let thirsty people drink the water."
Isaiah,32,7,They use evil like a tool and plan ways to steal from the poor. They tell lies about the poor and keep them from being judged fairly.
Isaiah,32,8,"But a good leader plans good things to do, and that will make him a leader over other leaders."
Isaiah,32,9,Some of you women are calm now; you feel safe. But you should stand and listen to the words I say.
Isaiah,32,10,"You feel safe now, but after one year you will be troubled. That is because you will not gather grapes next year—there will be no grapes to gather."
Isaiah,32,11,"Women, you are calm now, but you should be afraid. You feel safe now, but you should be worried. Take off your nice clothes and put on sackcloth. Wrap it around your waist."
Isaiah,32,12,"Beat your breasts in sorrow. Cry because your fields are empty. Your vineyards once gave grapes, but now they are empty."
Isaiah,32,13,Cry for the land of my people. Cry because only thorns and weeds will grow there. Cry for the city and for all the houses that were once filled with joy.
Isaiah,32,14,People will leave the capital city. The palace and towers will be left empty. People will not live in houses—they will live in caves. Wild donkeys and sheep will live in the city—animals will go there to eat grass.
Isaiah,32,15,This will continue until God gives us his Spirit from above. Then the desert will become rich farmland and the farmland will be like thick forests.
Isaiah,32,16,"That is, what is now a desert will be filled with right decisions, and what is now a farmland will be filled with justice."
Isaiah,32,17,That justice will bring peace and safety forever.
Isaiah,32,18,"My people will be safe in their homes and in their calm, peaceful fields."
Isaiah,32,19,"But before this happens, the forest must fall and the city must be torn down."
Isaiah,32,20,Some of you live away from the cities. You plant seeds by every stream and let your cattle and donkeys roam free. You will be very blessed.
Isaiah,33,1,"Look at you. You attack others when you have not been attacked. You turn against others when no one has turned against you. So when you stop your attacks, you will be attacked. When you stop turning against others, they will turn against you."
Isaiah,33,2,"LORD, be kind to us.
We have waited for your help.
Give us strength every morning.
Save us when we are in trouble."
Isaiah,33,3,"Your powerful voice makes people run away in fear.
Your greatness causes the nations to run away."
Isaiah,33,4,You people stole things in war. Those things will be taken from you. Many will come and take your wealth. It will be like the times when locusts come and eat all your crops.
Isaiah,33,5,The LORD is very great. He lives in a very high place. He fills Zion with justice and goodness.
Isaiah,33,6,"Jerusalem, you are rich with wisdom and knowledge of God. You are rich with salvation. You respect the LORD, and that makes you rich."
Isaiah,33,7,But listen! The messengers are crying outside. The messengers who bring peace are crying very hard.
Isaiah,33,8,"The roads are empty; there is no one walking along the paths. People don’t respect each other. They have broken the agreements they made, and they refuse to believe what witnesses tell them."
Isaiah,33,9,The land is sick and dying. Lebanon is dying and Sharon Valley is dry and empty. Bashan and Carmel once grew beautiful plants—but now those plants have stopped growing.
Isaiah,33,10,"The LORD says, “Now, I will stand and show people how great and powerful I am."
Isaiah,33,11,You people have done useless things. These things are like hay and straw. They are worth nothing! Your breath will be like a fire and burn you.
Isaiah,33,12,People will be burned until their bones become lime. They will burn quickly like thorns and dry bushes.
Isaiah,33,13,"“You people in faraway lands, listen to what I have done. You people who are near me, learn about my power.”"
Isaiah,33,14,"The sinners in Zion are afraid. Those who do wrong shake with fear. They say, “Can any of us live through this fire that destroys? Who can live near this fire that burns forever?”"
Isaiah,33,15,"Good, honest people who refuse to hurt others for money will live through that fire. They refuse to take bribes or listen to plans to murder other people. They refuse to look at plans for doing bad things."
Isaiah,33,16,They will live safely in high places. They will be protected in high rock fortresses. They will always have food and water.
Isaiah,33,17,Your eyes will see the King in his beauty. You will see the great land.
Isaiah,33,18,"When you think about the troubles you had in the past, you will wonder, “Where are those foreigners who spoke languages we could not understand. Where are the officials and tax collectors from other lands? Where are the spies who counted our defense towers?”"
Isaiah,33,19,"When you think about the troubles you had in the past, you will wonder, “Where are those foreigners who spoke languages we could not understand. Where are the officials and tax collectors from other lands? Where are the spies who counted our defense towers?”"
Isaiah,33,20,"Look at Zion, the city of our religious festivals. Look at Jerusalem—that beautiful place of rest. Jerusalem is like a tent that will never be moved. The pegs that hold her in place will never be pulled up. Her ropes will never be broken"
Isaiah,33,21,"because the LORD is our powerful leader there. That land is a place with streams and wide rivers, but there will be no enemy boats or powerful ships on those rivers. You men who work on such boats can stop your work with the ropes. You cannot make the mast strong enough. You will not be able to open your sails, because the is our powerful leader there. That land is a place with streams and wide rivers, but there will be no enemy boats or powerful ships on those rivers. You men who work on such boats can stop your work with the ropes.

Look, the LORD’s sword will cut through Edom. He judged them guilty, and they must die."
Isaiah,34,6,The LORD decided there should be a time for killing in Bozrah and in Edom. So the sword of the decided there should be a time for killing in Bozrah and in Edom. So the sword of the LORD is covered with blood and fat. The blood is from the “goats.” The fat is from the kidneys of the “rams.”
Isaiah,34,7,"So the rams, the cattle, and the strong bulls will be killed. The land will be filled with their blood. The dirt will be covered with their fat."
Isaiah,34,8,This will happen because the LORD has chosen a time for punishment. He has chosen a year when people must pay for the wrong they did to Zion.

Isaiah,35,1,The dry desert will rejoice. The desert will be glad and blossom.
Isaiah,35,2,"It will be covered with flowers and dance with joy. It will be as beautiful as the forest of Lebanon, the hill of Carmel, and the Sharon Valley. This will happen because all people will see the Glory of the LORD. They will see the beauty of our God."

Isaiah,36,4,"The commander told them, “Tell Hezekiah this is what the great king, the king of Assyria says:
“‘What are you trusting in to help you?"
Isaiah,36,5,"I tell you, if you are trusting in power and great battle plans, that is useless. Those are nothing but empty words. Now I ask you, who do you trust so much that you are willing to rebel against me?"
Isaiah,36,6,"Are you depending on Egypt to help you? Egypt is like a broken walking stick. If you lean on it for support, it will only stab you and hurt you. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, cannot be trusted by anyone who depends on him for help."
Isaiah,36,7,"“‘So maybe you will say, “We trust the LORD our God to help us.” But Hezekiah destroyed the altars and high places where people worshiped your God, right? Hezekiah told the people of Judah and Jerusalem, “You must worship only at this one altar here in Jerusalem.”"
Isaiah,36,8,"“‘If you still want to fight, my master, the king of Assyria, will make this agreement with you. I promise that I will give you 2000 horses if you can find enough men to ride them into battle."
Isaiah,36,9,"But even then, you couldn’t beat even one of my master’s lowest ranking officers. So why do you still depend on Egypt’s chariots and horse soldiers?"
Isaiah,36,10,"“‘Now, do you think I came to this country to destroy it without the LORD’s help. No, it was the ’s help. No, it was the LORD who said to me, “Go up against this country and destroy it!”’”"
Isaiah,36,11,"Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the commander, “Please, speak to us in Hebrew. We understand that language. Don’t speak to us in the language of Judah. If you use our language, the people on the city walls will understand you.”"
Isaiah,36,12,"But the commander said, “My master sent me to speak to everyone, not just to you and your master. I must also speak to those people sitting there on the wall. When we surround your city, they will suffer too. Like you, they will become so hungry they will eat their own waste and drink their own urine!”"
Isaiah,36,13,"Then the commander, shouting loudly in Hebrew, gave this warning to them all:
Hear this message from the great king, the king of Assyria!"
Isaiah,36,14,This is what the king says: Don’t let Hezekiah fool you! He cannot save you from my power.
Isaiah,36,15,"Don’t listen to him when he tells you to trust in the LORD. Don’t believe him when he says, “The . Don’t believe him when he says, “The LORD will save us. He will not let the king of Assyria defeat the city.”"
Isaiah,36,16,"Don’t listen to Hezekiah! This is what the king of Assyria says: Come out here and show me that you want peace. Then you will all be free to have grapes from your own vines, figs from your own trees, and water from your own well."
Isaiah,36,17,"After some time, I will come and take you to a land like your own. In that new land, you will have plenty of grain for making bread and vineyards for producing wine."
Isaiah,36,18,"Don’t believe Hezekiah when he tells you, “The LORD will save us.” He is wrong. Did any of the gods of other nations save their land from the king of Assyria?"
Isaiah,36,19,"When I destroyed the cities of Hamath and Arpad, where were their gods? What about the gods of Sepharvaim? Were any gods able to save Samaria from my power?"
Isaiah,36,20,None of the gods of these other places were able to save their land from me! So why do you think the LORD can save Jerusalem from me?
Isaiah,36,21,"But the people were silent. They did not say a word to the commander, because King Hezekiah had commanded them, “Don’t say anything to him.”"
Isaiah,36,22,"Then the palace manager (Eliakim son of Hilkiah), the royal secretary (Shebna), and the record keeper (Joah son of Asaph) went to Hezekiah. Their clothes were torn to show they were upset. They told Hezekiah everything the Assyrian commander had said."
Isaiah,37,1,"When King Hezekiah listened to their message, he tore his clothes to show he was upset. Then he put on sackcloth and went to the LORD’s Temple."
Isaiah,37,2,"Hezekiah sent Eliakim, the palace manager, Shebna, the royal secretary, and the elders of the priests to the prophet, Isaiah son of Amoz. They wore the special clothes that showed they were sad and upset."
Isaiah,37,3,"They said to Isaiah, “King Hezekiah has commanded that today will be a special day for sorrow and sadness. It will be a very sad day—as sad as when a baby should be born, but there is not enough strength for the birth."
Isaiah,37,4,"The commander’s master, the king of Assyria, has sent him to say bad things about the living God. Maybe the LORD your God will hear it and prove the enemy is wrong. So pray for those who are still left alive.”"
Isaiah,37,5,When King Hezekiah’s officers came to Isaiah
Isaiah,37,6,"he said to them, “Give this message to your master, Hezekiah: The LORD says, ‘Don’t be afraid of what you heard from the commanders! Don’t believe what those “boys” from the king of Assyria said to make fun of me."
Isaiah,37,7,"Look, I will send a spirit against the king of Assyria. He will get a report that will make him return to his own country. And I will cut him down with a sword in his own country.’”"
Isaiah,37,8,"The commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish. He found him at Libnah, fighting against that city."
Isaiah,37,9,"Then the king of Assyria got a report that said, “King Tirhakah of Ethiopia is coming to fight you.”
So the king of Assyria sent messengers to Hezekiah again."
Isaiah,37,10,"He told them, “Tell King Hezekiah of Judah these things:
‘Don’t be fooled by the god you trust when he says, “Jerusalem will not be defeated by the king of Assyria.”"
Isaiah,37,11,You have heard what the kings of Assyria did to all the other countries. We destroyed them completely. Will you be saved? No!
Isaiah,37,12,"Did the gods of those people save them? No, my ancestors destroyed them all. They destroyed the cities of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden living in Tel Assar."
Isaiah,37,13,Where is the king of Hamath? The king of Arpad? The king of the city of Sepharvaim? The kings of Hena and Ivvah?’”
Isaiah,37,14,Hezekiah received the letters from the messengers and read them. Then he went up to the LORD’s Temple and laid the letters out in front of the ’s Temple and laid the letters out in front of the LORD.
Isaiah,37,15,He prayed to the LORD
Isaiah,37,16,"“LORD All-Powerful, God of Israel, you sit as King above the Cherub angels. You alone are the God who rules all the kingdoms on earth. You made heaven and earth."
Isaiah,37,17,"LORD, please pay attention and hear this. Open your eyes, , please pay attention and hear this. Open your eyes, LORD, and see what is happening. Listen to all the insults against the living God in the message Sennacherib sent!"
Isaiah,37,18,"It is true, LORD. The kings of Assyria did destroy all those nations."
Isaiah,37,19,"They did throw the gods of those nations into the fire, but they were not real gods. They were only wood and stone—statues that people made. That is why the kings of Assyria could destroy them."
Isaiah,37,20,"But you are the LORD our God, so please save us from the king of Assyria. Then all the other nations will know that you are the our God, so please save us from the king of Assyria. Then all the other nations will know that you are the LORD, the only God.”"
Isaiah,37,21,"Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah: “The LORD, the God of Israel, says, ‘You prayed to me about the message that came from King Sennacherib of Assyria. I have heard you.’"
Isaiah,37,22,"“So this is the LORD’s message against Sennacherib:
‘The virgin daughter Zion does not think you are important.
She makes fun of you.
Daughter Jerusalem shakes her head at you
and laughs behind your back."
Isaiah,37,23,"But who was it that you insulted and made fun of?
Who was it that you spoke against?
You were speaking against the Holy One of Israel.
You acted like you were great and he was nothing."
Isaiah,37,24,"You sent your officers to insult the Lord.
This is what you said:
“I took my many chariots up the high mountains
deep inside Lebanon.
I cut down its tallest cedars
and its best fir trees.
I have been on its highest mountain
and deep inside its forests."
Isaiah,37,25,"I dug wells and drank water from new places.
I dried up the rivers of Egypt
and walked where the water was.”"
Isaiah,37,26,"‘How could you say this, Sennacherib?
Did no one ever tell you that I, the Lord, planned these things long ago?
From ancient times I decided what would happen.
And now I have made it happen.
I let you tear down strong cities
and change them into piles of rocks."
Isaiah,37,27,"The people living there had no power.
They were afraid and confused.
They were about to be cut down
like grass and plants in the field.
They were like grass growing on the housetops,
dying before it grows tall."
Isaiah,37,28,"I know all about your battles;
I know when you rested,
when you went out to war,
and when you came home.
I also know when you got upset at me."
Isaiah,37,29,"Yes, you were upset at me.
I heard your proud insults.
So I will put my hook in your nose
and my bit in your mouth.
Then I will turn you around
and lead you back the way you came.’”"
Isaiah,37,30,"Then the Lord said, “I will give you a sign to show you that these words are true. You will not be able to plant seeds this year, so next year you will eat grain that grew wild from the previous year’s crop. But in the third year, you will eat grain from seeds that you planted. You will harvest your crops, and you will have plenty to eat. You will plant vineyards and eat grapes from them."
Isaiah,37,31,“The people from the family of Judah who have escaped and are left alive will be like plants that send their roots deep into the ground and produce fruit above the ground.
Isaiah,37,32,That is because a few people will come out of Jerusalem alive. There will be survivors coming from Mount Zion.” The strong love of the LORD All-Powerful will do this.
Isaiah,37,33,"So the LORD says this about the king of Assyria:
“He will not come into this city
or shoot an arrow here.
He will not bring his shields up against this city
or build up a hill of dirt to attack its walls."
Isaiah,37,34,"He will go back the way he came.
He will not come into this city.
The LORD says this!"
Isaiah,37,35,"I will protect this city and save it.
I will do this for myself and for my servant David.”"
Isaiah,37,36,"That night the angel of the LORD went out and killed 185,000 men in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up in the morning, they saw all the dead bodies."
Isaiah,37,37,So King Sennacherib of Assyria went back to Nineveh and stayed there.
Isaiah,37,38,"One day Sennacherib was in the temple of his god Nisroch, worshiping him. His sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with a sword and ran away to Ararat. So Sennacherib’s son Esarhaddon became the new king of Assyria."
Isaiah,38,1,"At that time Hezekiah became sick and almost died. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to see him and told him, “The LORD told me to tell you this: ‘You will die soon. So you should tell your family what they should do when you die. You will not get well.’”"
Isaiah,38,2,Hezekiah turned toward the wall that faced the Temple and began praying to the LORD.
Isaiah,38,3,"“LORD, remember that I have faithfully served you with all my heart. I have done what you say is good.” Then Hezekiah cried very hard."
Isaiah,38,4,Then Isaiah received this message from the LORD
Isaiah,38,5,"“Go to Hezekiah and tell him that the LORD, the God of your ancestor David, says, ‘I heard your prayer, and I saw your tears. I will add 15 years to your life."
Isaiah,38,6,I will save you and this city from the king of Assyria. I will protect this city.’”
Isaiah,38,7,This is the sign from the LORD to show you that he will do what he says
Isaiah,38,8,"“Look, I am causing the shadow that is on the steps of Ahaz to move back ten steps. The sun’s shadow will go back up the ten steps that it has already been on.”"
Isaiah,38,9,This is the letter from Hezekiah when he became well
Isaiah,38,10,"I thought I would live a full life.
But now, in the middle of my life, the time has come for me to die."
Isaiah,38,11,"So I said, “I will not see the LORD YAH in the land of the living again.
I will not see the people living on earth."
Isaiah,38,12,"My home, my shepherd’s tent, is being pulled down and taken from me.
I am finished like the cloth someone rolls up and cuts from the loom.
You ended my life in such a short time."
Isaiah,38,13,"All night I cried as loud as a lion,
but my hopes were crushed like a lion eating bones.
You finished my life in such a short time."
Isaiah,38,14,"I cried like a bird
and moaned like a dove.
My eyes became tired,
but I continued looking to the heavens.
Lord, I am so depressed.
Promise to help me.”"
Isaiah,38,15,"What can I say?
He told me what would happen,
and he will make it happen.
I have had these troubles in my soul,
so now I will be humble all my life."
Isaiah,38,16,"Lord, use this hard time to make my spirit live again.
Help my spirit become strong and healthy.
Help me become well!
Help me live again!"
Isaiah,38,17,"Look, my troubles are gone!
I now have peace.
You love me very much.
You did not let me rot in the grave.
You took my sins
and threw them away."
Isaiah,38,18,"The dead cannot praise you.
People in Sheol cannot sing praises to you.
Those who have died and gone below
are not trusting in your faithfulness."
Isaiah,38,19,"People who are alive, people like me,
are the ones who will praise you.
Fathers should tell their children about how faithful you are."
Isaiah,38,20,"So I say, “The LORD saved me.
So we will sing and play songs in the LORD’s Temple all our lives.”"
Isaiah,38,21,"Then Isaiah told Hezekiah, “Crush figs together and put them on your sore. Then you will get well.”"
Isaiah,38,22,"Hezekiah asked Isaiah, “What is the sign that proves I will get well and go to the LORD’s Temple?”"
Isaiah,39,1,At that time Merodach Baladan son of Baladan was king of Babylon. He sent some men with letters and a gift to Hezekiah when he heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
Isaiah,39,2,"This made Hezekiah very happy, so he showed them all the valuable things in his storehouses. He showed them the silver, the gold, the spices, and the expensive perfumes. He showed them the building where he stored the weapons. He showed them everything in his treasuries and everything in his house and throughout his kingdom."
Isaiah,39,3,"Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say? Where did they come from?”
Hezekiah said, “These men came all the way from Babylon just to see me.”"
Isaiah,39,4,"So Isaiah asked him, “What did they see in your house?”
Hezekiah said, “They saw everything in my palace. I showed them all my wealth.”"
Isaiah,39,5,"Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to this message from the LORD All-Powerful"
Isaiah,39,6,‘The time is coming when everything in your house and everything your ancestors have saved until today will be carried away to Babylon. Nothing will be left!’ The LORD All-Powerful said this.
Isaiah,39,7,"The Babylonians will take your own sons, and your sons will become officers in the palace of the king of Babylon.”"
Isaiah,39,8,"Then Hezekiah told Isaiah, “This message from the LORD is good.” (Hezekiah said this because he thought, “There will be real peace and security during my lifetime.”)"
Isaiah,40,1,"Your God says,
“Comfort, comfort my people."
Isaiah,40,2,"Speak kindly to Jerusalem and tell her,
‘Your time of service is finished.
You have paid the price for your sins.’
I, the LORD, have punished you twice
for every sin you committed.”"
Isaiah,40,3,"Listen, there is someone shouting:
“Prepare a way in the desert for the LORD.
Make a straight road there for our God."
Isaiah,40,4,"Every valley must be filled.
Every mountain and hill should be made flat.
The crooked roads should be made straight,
and the rough ground made smooth."
Isaiah,40,5,"Then the Glory of the LORD will be shown to everyone.
Together, all people will see it.
Yes, this is what the LORD himself said!”"
Isaiah,40,6,"A voice said, “Speak!”
So the man said, “What should I say?”
The voice said, “People are like grass.
Any glory they enjoy is like a wildflower."
Isaiah,40,7,"When a wind from the LORD blows on them,
the grass dies and the flower falls.
Yes, all people are like grass."
Isaiah,40,8,"Grass dies and flowers fall,
but the word of our God lasts forever.”"
Isaiah,40,9,"Zion, you have good news to tell.
Go up on a high mountain and shout the good news.
Jerusalem, you have good news to tell.
Don’t be afraid; speak loudly.
Tell this news to all the cities of Judah:
“Look, here is your God!”"
Isaiah,40,10,"The Lord GOD is coming with power.
He will use his power to rule all the people.
He will bring rewards for his people.
He will have their payment with him."
Isaiah,40,11,"Like a good shepherd, he takes care of his people.
He gathers them like lambs in his arms.
He holds them close, while their mothers walk beside him."
Isaiah,40,12,"Who measured the oceans in the palm of his hand?
Who used his hand to measure the sky?
Who used a bowl to measure all the dust of the earth?
Who used scales to measure the mountains and hills?"
Isaiah,40,13,"Who could know the LORD’s mind?
Who could be his teacher or give him advice?"
Isaiah,40,14,"Did the Lord ask for anyone’s help?
Did anyone teach him to be fair?
Did anyone teach him knowledge?
Did anyone teach him to be wise?"
Isaiah,40,15,"Look, all the nations in the world are like one small drop in the bucket.
If the Lord took all the faraway nations and put them on his scales,
they would be like small pieces of dust."
Isaiah,40,16,"All the trees in Lebanon are not enough
to burn on the altar for the Lord.
And all the animals in Lebanon
are not enough to kill for a sacrifice."
Isaiah,40,17,"Compared to God, all the nations of the world are nothing.
Compared to him, they are worth nothing at all."
Isaiah,40,18,"Can you compare God to anything?
Can you make a picture of God?"
Isaiah,40,19,"No, but some people make statues from rock or wood,
and they call them gods.
One worker makes a statue.
Then another worker covers it with gold and makes silver chains for it."
Isaiah,40,20,"For the base he chooses special wood,
a kind of wood that will not rot.
Then he finds a good wood worker,
and the worker makes a “god” that will not fall over."
Isaiah,40,21,"Surely you know the truth, don’t you?
Surely you have heard.
Surely someone told you long ago.
Surely you understand who made the earth."
Isaiah,40,22,"It is the Lord who sits above the circle of the earth.
And compared to him, people are like grasshoppers.
He rolled open the skies like a piece of cloth.
He stretched out the skies like a tent to sit under."
Isaiah,40,23,"He takes away the power of rulers.
He makes the world’s leaders completely worthless."
Isaiah,40,24,"They are like plants that are planted in the ground.
But before they can send their roots into the ground,
God blows on the “plants”;
they become dead and dry,
and the wind blows them away like straw."
Isaiah,40,25,"The Holy One says, “Can you compare me to anyone?
No one is equal to me.”"
Isaiah,40,26,"Look up to the skies.
Who created all those stars?
Who created all those “armies” in the sky?
Who knows every star by name?
He is very strong and powerful,
so not one of these stars is lost."
Isaiah,40,27,"People of Jacob, this is true.
Israel, you should believe it.
So why do you say, “The LORD cannot see the way I live;
he will not find me and punish me”?"
Isaiah,40,28,"Surely you know the truth.
Surely you have heard.
The LORD is the God who lives forever!
He created all the faraway places on earth.
He does not get tired and weary.
You cannot learn all he knows."
Isaiah,40,29,"He helps tired people be strong.
He gives power to those without it."
Isaiah,40,30,"Young men get tired and need to rest.
Even young boys stumble and fall."
Isaiah,40,31,"But those who trust in the LORD will become strong again.
They will be like eagles that grow new feathers.
They will run and not get weak.
They will walk and not get tired."
Isaiah,41,1,"The Lord says,
“Faraway countries, be quiet and listen to me!
Nations be brave.
Come to me and speak.
We will meet together
and decide who is right."
Isaiah,41,2,"Who woke up the man who is coming from the east?
He called Justice to march with him.
He uses his sword to crush nations.
He uses his bow and conquers kings—
they run away like straw blown by the wind."
Isaiah,41,3,"He chases armies and is never hurt.
He goes places he has never been before."
Isaiah,41,4,"Who was able to make all this happen?
Who controlled the lives of everyone from the beginning?
I, the LORD, am the one.
I was here at the beginning,
and I will be here when all things are finished."
Isaiah,41,5,"People along the coast saw this,
and they were frightened.
Nations at the ends of the earth
shook with fear.
They have come near.
They have arrived."
Isaiah,41,6,“Workers help each other. They encourage each other to be strong.
Isaiah,41,7,"One worker cuts wood to make a statue. He encourages the man who works with gold. Another worker uses a hammer and makes the metal smooth. Then he encourages the man at the anvil. This last worker says, ‘This work is good; the metal will not come off.’ Then he nails the statue to a base so that it will not fall over. And it never moves!”"
Isaiah,41,8,"The Lord says, “You, Israel, are my servant.
Jacob, I chose you.
You are from the family of my friend, Abraham."
Isaiah,41,9,"You were in a faraway country,
but I reached out to you.
I called you from that faraway place.
I said, ‘You are my servant.’
I chose you,
and I have not rejected you."
Isaiah,41,10,"Don’t worry—I am with you.
Don’t be afraid—I am your God.
I will make you strong and help you.
I will support you with my right hand that brings victory."
Isaiah,41,11,"Look, some people are angry with you,
but they will be ashamed and disgraced.
Your enemies will be lost and disappear."
Isaiah,41,12,"You will look for the people who were against you,
but you will not be able to find them.
Those who fought against you
will disappear completely."
Isaiah,41,13,"I am the LORD your God,
who holds your right hand.
And I tell you, ‘Don’t be afraid!
I will help you.’"
Isaiah,41,14,"People of Israel, descendants of Jacob, you may be weak and worthless,
but do not be afraid.
I myself will help you.”
This is what the LORD himself says.
“I am the Holy One of Israel,
the one who saves you."
Isaiah,41,15,"Look, I have made you like a new threshing board with many sharp teeth.
You will trample mountains and crush them.
You will make the hills like chaff."
Isaiah,41,16,"You will throw them into the air,
and the wind will blow them away and scatter them.
Then you will be happy in the LORD.
You will be proud of the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,41,17,"“The poor and needy look for water,
but they cannot find any.
Their tongues are dry with thirst.
I, the LORD, will answer their prayers.
I, the God of Israel, will not leave them to die."

I will make springs of water flow through the valleys.
I will change the desert into a lake filled with water.
There will be springs of water in that dry land."
Isaiah,41,19,"I will make trees grow in the desert.
There will be cedar, acacias, olive trees, cypress, fir trees, and pines."

They will notice what happened.
Then they will understand that the LORD’s hand made it happen,
that the Holy One of Israel created it all.”"
Isaiah,41,21,"The LORD, the king of Jacob, says, “Come, present your arguments. Show me your proof."
Isaiah,41,22,"Let your idols come in and tell us what will happen. Idols, tell us what happened in the beginning. We will listen closely so that we can make a decision. Tell us what will happen in the future."
Isaiah,41,23,"What signs did you give in the past to prove that you really are gods? Do something! Do anything, good or bad, so that we can see that you are alive. Then we might fear and respect you."
Isaiah,41,24,"“Look, you false gods are worthless. You cannot do anything. Only some horrible fool would want to worship you.”"
Isaiah,41,25,"“I called someone in the north to come.
He is coming from the east where the sun rises,
and he honors my name.
He tramples kings
the way a potter softens clay with his feet."
Isaiah,41,26,"“Who told us about this before it happened
so that we could say he was right?
None of your idols told us anything.
They didn’t say a word,
and they cannot hear anything you say."
Isaiah,41,27,"I, the Lord, was the first one to tell Zion about these things.
I sent a messenger to Jerusalem to say,
‘Look, your people are coming back!’”"
Isaiah,41,28,"I looked at those false gods.
Not one of them said anything.
They had no advice to offer.
I asked them questions,
but they didn’t say a word."
Isaiah,41,29,"Those gods are all less than nothing.
They cannot do anything.
They are worthless."
Isaiah,42,1,"“Here is my servant,
the one I support.
He is the one I have chosen,
and I am very pleased with him.
I have filled him with my Spirit,
and he will bring justice to the nations."

or try to make himself heard in the streets."
Isaiah,42,3,"He will not break even a crushed reed.
He will not put out even the weakest flame.
He will bring true justice."

until he has brought justice to the world.
And people in faraway places will hope to receive his teachings.”"

I have controlled myself and kept quiet.
But now I will cry out like a woman giving birth.
My breathing is getting faster and louder."
Isaiah,42,15,"I will destroy the hills and mountains.
I will dry up all the plants that grow there.
I will change rivers to dry land
and dry up pools of water."
Isaiah,42,16,"Then I will lead the blind along a path they never knew
to places where they have never been before.
I will change darkness into light for them.
I will make the rough ground smooth.
I will do these things for them;
I will not abandon my people."
Isaiah,42,17,"But some of them have left me.
They say to their gold statues, ‘You are my gods.’
They trust their false gods,
but they will be disappointed and shamed."
Isaiah,42,18,"“Deaf people, listen to me!
Blind people, look and see!"
Isaiah,42,19,"In all the world, no one is more blind than my servant.
No one is more deaf than my messenger.
No one is more blind than my chosen people,
the servant of the LORD."
Isaiah,42,20,"My people see what they should do,
but they do not obey me.
They can hear with their ears,
but they refuse to listen to me.”"
Isaiah,42,21,"The LORD wants them to do what is right.
He wants them to honor his wonderful teachings."
Isaiah,42,22,"But look at his people.
Others have defeated them and have stolen from them.
The young men are afraid.
They are locked in prisons.
People have taken advantage of them,
and there is no one to protect them.
Others take their money,
and there is no one to say, “Give it back!”"
Isaiah,42,23,Will any of you pay attention to this warning? Will you ever learn to listen?
Isaiah,42,24,"Who let Jacob be defeated? Who let others take what belonged to Israel? The LORD allowed them to do this. We sinned against him, so he let people take away our wealth. The people did not want to live the way he wanted. They refused to listen to his teaching."
Isaiah,42,25,"So he poured out his anger on them and brought wars against them. It was as if there were fires all around them, but they didn’t know what was happening. It was as if they were burning, but they didn’t try to understand."
Isaiah,43,1,"Jacob, the LORD created you. Israel, he made you, and now he says, “Don’t be afraid. I saved you. I named you. You are mine."
Isaiah,43,2,"When you have troubles, I am with you. When you cross rivers, you will not be hurt. When you walk through fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not hurt you."
Isaiah,43,3,"That’s because I, the LORD, am your God. I, the Holy One of Israel, am your Savior. I gave Egypt to pay for you. I gave Ethiopia and Seba to make you mine."
Isaiah,43,4,"You are precious to me, and I have given you a special place of honor. I love you. That’s why I am willing to trade others, to give up whole nations, to save your life."
Isaiah,43,5,"“So don’t be afraid, because I am with you. I will gather your children and bring them to you. I will gather them from the east and from the west."
Isaiah,43,6,I will tell the north: Give my people to me. I will tell the south: Don’t keep my people in prison. Bring my sons and daughters to me from the faraway places.
Isaiah,43,7,"Bring to me all the people who are mine—the people who have my name. I made them for myself. I made them, and they are mine."
Isaiah,43,8,“Bring out the people who have eyes but are blind. Bring out the people who have ears but are deaf.
Isaiah,43,9,All people and all nations should also be gathered together. Which of their gods said this would happen? Which of their gods would tell what happened in the beginning? They should bring their witnesses. The witnesses should speak the truth. This will show they are right.”
Isaiah,43,10,"The LORD says, “You people are my witnesses and the servant I chose. I chose you so that you would help people believe me. I chose you so that you would understand that ‘I Am He’—I am the true God. There was no God before me, and there will be no God after me."
Isaiah,43,11,"I myself am the LORD, and there is no other Savior."
Isaiah,43,12,"I am the one who spoke to you, saved you, and told you those things. It was not some stranger who was with you. You are my witnesses, and I am God.” (This is what the LORD himself said.)"
Isaiah,43,13,"“I have always been God. When I do something, no one can change what I have done. And no one can save people from my power.”"
Isaiah,43,14,"The LORD, the Holy One of Israel, saves you, and he says, “I will send armies to Babylon for you. Many people will be captured. Those Chaldeans will be taken away in their own boats. (They are so proud of those boats.)"
Isaiah,43,15,I am the LORD your Holy One. I made Israel. I am your King.”
Isaiah,43,16,"The Lord is making roads through the sea. He is making a path for his people, even through rough waters. The LORD says"
Isaiah,43,17,"“Those who fight against me with their chariots, horses, and armies will be defeated. They will never rise again. They will be destroyed. They will be put out like the flame in a lamp."
Isaiah,43,18,So don’t remember what happened in earlier times. Don’t think about what happened a long time ago
Isaiah,43,19,"because I am doing something new! Now you will grow like a new plant. Surely you know this is true. I will even make a road in the desert, and rivers will flow through that dry land."
Isaiah,43,20,The wild animals will thank me. The large animals and birds will honor me when I put water in the desert and make rivers flow through that dry land. I will do this to give water to my chosen people.
Isaiah,43,21,"I made them, and they will sing songs of praise to me."
Isaiah,43,22,"“Jacob, you did not pray to me. Israel, you became tired of me."
Isaiah,43,23,You have not brought your sheep as sacrifices to me. You have not honored me with your sacrifices. I did not force you to give gifts to me like slaves. I did not force you to burn incense until you became tired.
Isaiah,43,24,So you did not use your money to buy things to honor me. But you did force me to be like your slave. You sinned until the bad things you did made me very tired.
Isaiah,43,25,"“I, I am the one who wipes away all your sins. I do this to please myself. I will not remember your sins."
Isaiah,43,26,But you should remember me. Let’s meet together and decide what is right. Tell your story and prove that you are innocent.
Isaiah,43,27,"Your first father sinned, and your lawyers committed crimes against me."
Isaiah,43,28,I will make your Temple leaders unfit to serve there. I will destroy Jacob. Bad things will happen to Israel.
Isaiah,44,1,"“Jacob, you are my servant. Israel, I chose you. Listen to me!"
Isaiah,44,2,"I am the LORD, and I made you. I am the one who created you. I have helped you since you were in your mother’s womb. Jacob, my servant, don’t be afraid. Jeshurun, I chose you."
Isaiah,44,3,"“I will pour water for thirsty people, and streams will flow through the desert. I will pour my Spirit on your children, and I will bless your family."
Isaiah,44,4,They will sprout like grass in the spring and grow like trees by streams of water.
Isaiah,44,5,"“One man will call himself, ‘I am the LORD’s.’ Another will use the name, ‘Jacob.’ Another man will sign his name as ‘The ’s.’ Another will use the name, ‘Jacob.’ Another man will sign his name as ‘The LORD’s Hand.’ And another will use the name, ‘Israel.’”"
Isaiah,44,6,"The LORD is the king of Israel. The is the king of Israel. The LORD All-Powerful is the one who will set Israel free. And he says, “I am the only God. There are no other gods. I am the Beginning and the End."
Isaiah,44,7,"There is no other God like me. If there is, that god should speak now. Let him lay out everything he has done since the time I made these ancient people. Let him show me the signs he gave long ago that prove he knew what would happen in the future."
Isaiah,44,8,“Don’t be afraid! Don’t worry. I am the one who always told you what would happen. You are my proof. There is no other God; I am the only one. There is no other ‘Rock’; I know I am the only one.”
Isaiah,44,9,"Some people make idols, but they are worthless. They love their statues, which are useless. Those who serve as witnesses for these statues cannot even see. They don’t know enough to be ashamed."
Isaiah,44,10,Who made these false gods? Who covered these useless statues?
Isaiah,44,11,"Workers made them, and the workers are only human. If they all would come together before me, we could discuss this. Then they would all be ashamed and afraid."
Isaiah,44,12,"One worker uses his tools to heat iron over hot coals. Then he uses his hammer to beat the metal to shape it into a statue. He uses his own powerful arms, but when he gets hungry, he loses his strength. If he does not drink water, he becomes weak."
Isaiah,44,13,"Another worker uses his string line and compass to draw lines on the wood to show where he should cut. Then he uses his chisels and cuts a statue from the wood. He uses his calipers to measure the statue. In this way the worker makes the wood look exactly like a man, and this statue of a man does nothing but sit in the house."
Isaiah,44,14,"To split the cedar tree, the worker took some oak or cypress wedges. To make sure he had plenty of wood, he planted some pines. But it was the rain that made them grow."
Isaiah,44,15,"When the man wanted a fire, he took some of the wood to keep him warm. He also used some of it to bake his bread. But then he used that same wood to make a statue to worship as a god! That god is only a statue that he made, but he bows down to it!"
Isaiah,44,16,"He burns half of the wood in the fire. He uses the fire to cook his meat, and he eats the meat until he is full. He burns the wood to keep himself warm. He says, “Good! Now I am warm, and I can see by the light of the fire.”"
Isaiah,44,17,"There is a little of the wood left, so he makes a statue and calls it his god. He bows down before it and worships it. He prays to it and says, “You are my god, save me!”"
Isaiah,44,18,People like that don’t know what they are doing! They don’t understand. It is as if they have mud in their eyes so they cannot see. Their minds cannot understand.
Isaiah,44,19,"They don’t realize what they are doing. They aren’t smart enough to think, “I burned half of the wood in the fire. I used the hot coals to bake my bread and cook the meat I ate. And I used the wood that was left to make this terrible thing. I am worshiping a block of wood!”"
Isaiah,44,20,"Someone like that is deceived. They don’t know what they are doing. They cannot save themselves, and they will not admit, “This statue I am holding is a lie!”"
Isaiah,44,21,"“Jacob, remember these things!
Israel, remember, you are my servant.
I made you, and you are my servant.
So, Israel, don’t forget me."
Isaiah,44,22,"Your sins were like a big cloud,
but I wiped them all away.
Your sins are gone,
like a cloud that disappeared into thin air.
I rescued and protected you,
so come back to me.”"
Isaiah,44,23,"Skies, rejoice for what the LORD has done.
Earth, shout for joy down to your deepest parts!
Start singing, you mountains
and all you trees in the forest!
Yes, the LORD has saved Jacob.
He has shown his glory by rescuing Israel."
Isaiah,44,24,"The one who rescued you is the LORD,
the one who formed you in your mother’s womb.
He says, “I, the LORD, made everything.
I put the skies there myself.
I spread out the earth before me.”"
Isaiah,44,25,"False prophets tell lies, but the Lord shows that their lies are false. He makes fools of those who do magic. He confuses even the wise. They think they know a lot, but he makes them look foolish."
Isaiah,44,26,"The Lord sends his servants to tell his messages to the people, and he makes those messages come true. He sends messengers to tell the people what they should do, and he proves that the advice is good.
The Lord says to Jerusalem, “People will live in you again.”
He says to the cities of Judah, “You will be rebuilt.”
He says to them, “I will repair your ruins.”"
Isaiah,44,27,"He tells the deep waters, “Become dry!
I will make your streams dry too.”"
Isaiah,44,28,"He says to Cyrus, “You are my shepherd.
You will do what I want.
You will say to Jerusalem, ‘You will be rebuilt!’
You will tell the Temple, ‘Your foundations will be put in place!’”"
Isaiah,45,1,"This is what the LORD said to Cyrus, his chosen king:
“I took you by your right hand to help you defeat nations,
to strip other kings of their power,
and to open city gates that will not be closed again."
Isaiah,45,2,"I will go in front of you
and make the mountains flat.
I will break the city gates of bronze
and cut the iron bars on the gates."
Isaiah,45,3,"I will give you the wealth that is stored in secret places.
I will give you those hidden treasures.
Then you will know that I am the LORD,
the God of Israel, who calls you by name."
Isaiah,45,4,"I do this for my servant, Jacob.
I do it for my chosen people, Israel.
Cyrus, I am calling you by name.
You don’t know me, but I know you."
Isaiah,45,5,"I am the LORD, the only God.
There is no other God except me.
I put your clothes on you,
but still you don’t know me."
Isaiah,45,6,"I am doing this so that everyone will know
that I am the only God.
From the east to the west, people will know that I am the LORD
and that there is no other God."
Isaiah,45,7,"I made the light and the darkness.
I bring peace, and I cause trouble.
I, the LORD, do all these things."
Isaiah,45,8,"“May the clouds in the skies above
pour goodness on the earth like rain.
May the earth open up
to let salvation grow.
And may goodness grow with that salvation,
which I, the LORD, created."
Isaiah,45,9,"“Look at these people! They are arguing with the one who made them. Look at them argue with me. They are like pieces of clay from a broken pot. Clay does not say to the one molding it, ‘Man, what are you doing?’ Things that are made don’t have the power to question the one who makes them."
Isaiah,45,10,"A father gives life to his children, and they cannot ask, ‘Why are you giving me life?’ They cannot question their mother and ask, ‘Why are you giving birth to me?’”"
Isaiah,45,11,"The LORD God is the Holy One of Israel. He created Israel, and he says,
“My children, you asked me to show you a sign.
You told me to show you what I have done."
Isaiah,45,12,"I made the earth,
and I created the people on it.
I used my own hands to make the skies.
And I command all the armies in the sky."
Isaiah,45,13,"I was right to give power to Cyrus,
and I will make his work easy.
He will rebuild my city,
and he will set my people free without bribes or payment.”
The LORD All-Powerful said this."
Isaiah,45,14,"The LORD says, “Egypt and Ethiopia are rich,
but, Israel, you will get those riches.
The tall people from Seba will be yours.
They will walk behind you with chains around their necks.
They will bow down before you
and ask you to pray for them and say,
‘The true God really is with you,
and there is no other God.’”"
Isaiah,45,15,"You are the God people cannot see.
You are the God who saves Israel."
Isaiah,45,16,"Many people make false gods,
but they will be disappointed.
All of them will go away ashamed."
Isaiah,45,17,"But Israel will be saved by the LORD.
That salvation will continue forever.
Never again will Israel be shamed."
Isaiah,45,18,"The LORD is God.
He made the skies and the earth.
He put the earth in its place.
He did not want the earth to be empty when he made it.
He created it to be lived on.
“I am the LORD.
There is no other God."
Isaiah,45,19,"I have spoken openly, not in secret.
I did not hide my words in a dark and secret place.
I did not tell the people of Jacob
to look for me in empty places.
I am the LORD, and I speak the truth.
I say only what is right."
Isaiah,45,20,"“You people who escaped from other nations, gather together before me. (These people carry statues of false gods. They pray to useless gods, but they don’t know what they are doing."
Isaiah,45,21,"Tell them to come to me. Let them present their case and discuss these things.)
“Who told you about this before it happened? Who told you this so long ago? I, the LORD, am the one who said these things. I am the only God, the one who does what is right. I am the one who saves, and there is no other!"
Isaiah,45,22,"So all you people in faraway places, turn to me and be saved, because I am God, and there is no other."
Isaiah,45,23,"“When I make a promise, that promise is true. It will happen. And I swear by my own power that everyone will bow before me and will take an oath to obey me."
Isaiah,45,24,"They will say, ‘Goodness and strength come only from the LORD.’”
And all who show their anger against him will be humiliated."
Isaiah,45,25,The LORD will help the people of Israel live right and praise their God.
Isaiah,46,1,"The Lord says, “Bel has fallen to the ground. Nebo is kneeling before me.
“Men put those idols on the backs of animals. They are only heavy burdens that must be carried. They do nothing but make people tired."
Isaiah,46,2,But they all bowed down and fell to the ground. They couldn’t escape; they were all carried away like prisoners.
Isaiah,46,3,"“Family of Jacob, listen to me! You who are left from the family of Israel, listen! I have carried you since you left your mother’s womb. I carried you when you were born"
Isaiah,46,4,"and I will still be carrying you when you are old. Your hair will turn gray, and I will still carry you. I made you, and I will carry you to safety."
Isaiah,46,5,“Can you compare me to anyone? No one is equal to me. You cannot understand everything about me. There is nothing like me.
Isaiah,46,6,"Some people are rich with gold and silver. Gold falls from their purses, and they weigh their silver on scales. They pay an artist to make a false god from wood. Then they bow down and worship that false god."
Isaiah,46,7,"They put their false god on their shoulders and carry it. That false god is useless; people have to carry it! People set the statue on the ground, and it cannot move. That false god never walks away from its place. People can yell at it, but it will not answer. That false god is only a statue; it cannot save people from their troubles."
Isaiah,46,8,"“Sinners, change your heart and mind. Think about this again. Remember it and be strong."
Isaiah,46,9,"Remember what happened long ago. Remember, I am God and there is no other God. There is no other like me."
Isaiah,46,10,"“In the beginning, I told you what would happen in the end. A long time ago, I told you things that have not happened yet. When I plan something, it happens. I do whatever I want to do."
Isaiah,46,11,I am calling a man from the east to do what I want. He will come like an eagle from a faraway country. He will do all that I have planned. Everything I said will happen just as I said it would.
Isaiah,46,12,"“Listen to me, you stubborn people! You are far from doing what is right."
Isaiah,46,13,But I am close to making things right. Salvation will not be delayed much longer. I will bring salvation to Zion and to my wonderful Israel.”
Isaiah,47,1,"“Fall down and sit in the dirt, Virgin Daughter Babylon.
You have no throne, so sit on the ground, daughter of the Chaldeans.
You are not the ruler now.
You are no longer the beautiful young princess that people said you were."
Isaiah,47,2,"Get the millstones ready
and grind the grain into flour.
Take off your veil and fancy clothes.
Lift your skirt and get ready to cross the rivers."
Isaiah,47,3,"Men will see your naked body
and use you for sex.
I will make you pay for the bad things you did,
and I will not let anyone help you."
Isaiah,47,4,"“My people say, ‘God saves us.
His name is the LORD All-Powerful, the Holy One of Israel.’”"
Isaiah,47,5,"“So Babylon, sit down and shut up.
Daughter of the Chaldeans, go into the dark prison.
You will no longer be ‘The Queen of the Kingdoms.’"
Isaiah,47,6,"“I was angry with my people.
They were mine, but I turned against them.
I let you punish them,
but you showed them no mercy.
Even for those who were old
you made the work hard."
Isaiah,47,7,"You said, ‘I will live forever.
I will always be the queen.’
You didn’t care what you did to my people.
You didn’t think about what might happen later."
Isaiah,47,8,"So now listen, you who love only pleasure!
Feeling so safe, you tell yourself,
‘I alone am important, and no one else matters.
I will never be a widow or lose my children.’"
Isaiah,47,9,"These two things will happen to you:
First, you will lose your children and then your husband.
And none of your magic spells will help you."
Isaiah,47,10,"You do bad things but still feel safe.
You say to yourself, ‘No one sees the wrong I do.’
You thought that your wisdom and knowledge would save you.
You tell yourself, ‘I alone am important,
and no one else matters.’"
Isaiah,47,11,"“But disaster is coming your way.
You don’t know when it will happen, but disaster is coming.
And there is nothing you can do to stop it."
Isaiah,47,12,"You worked hard all your life
learning magic and spells.
So start using that magic.
Maybe those spells will help you.
Maybe you will be able to frighten someone."
Isaiah,47,13,"You have many advisors.
Are you tired of the advice they give?
Then send out your men who read the stars.
They can tell when the month starts,
so maybe they can tell you when your troubles will come."
Isaiah,47,14,"But they cannot even save themselves.
They will burn like straw.
They will burn so fast that there will be no coals left to cook bread.
There will be no fire left to sit by."
Isaiah,47,15,"That’s what will happen to those you have worked with,
the people you did business with all your life.
They will all go their own way.
There will be no one left to save you.”"
Isaiah,48,1,"“Family of Jacob, listen to me!
You people call yourself ‘Israel,’
but you are from Judah’s family.
When you take an oath, I, the LORD, the God of Israel,
am the one whose name you use,
but you are not honest and sincere."
Isaiah,48,2,"“Yes, you call yourselves citizens of the holy city,
those who depend on the God of Israel.
The LORD All-Powerful is his name."
Isaiah,48,3,"“Long ago I told you what would happen.
I told you about these things.
And suddenly I made them happen."
Isaiah,48,4,"I did that because I knew you were stubborn.
You were like iron that will not bend,
with heads as hard as bronze."
Isaiah,48,5,"So long ago I told you what would happen.
I told you about those things long before they happened.
I did this so that you could not say,
‘The gods we made did this.
Our idols, our statues, made this happen.’”"
Isaiah,48,6,"“You heard what I said would happen.
And you can see it has all been done.
Shouldn’t you tell this to others?
Now I will tell you about new things,
secrets you have not known before."
Isaiah,48,7,"This is something that is happening now, not long ago.
You have not heard about it before today.
So you cannot say, ‘We already knew that.’"
Isaiah,48,8,"But even in the past you didn’t listen.
You didn’t learn anything.
You never listen to what I say.
I have always known that you would turn against me.
You have rebelled against me from the time you were born."
Isaiah,48,9,"“But I will be patient.
I will do this for myself.
People will praise me for not becoming angry and destroying you.
You will praise me for waiting."
Isaiah,48,10,"“Look, I will make you pure,
but not in the way you make silver pure.
I will make you pure by giving you troubles."
Isaiah,48,11,"I will do this for myself—for me!
I will not let you treat me as if I am not important.
I will not let some false god take my glory and praise."
Isaiah,48,12,"“Jacob, listen to me!
Israel, I called you to be my people.
So listen to me!
I am the Beginning,
and I am the End."
Isaiah,48,13,"I made the earth with my own hands.
My right hand made the sky.
And if I call them,
they will come to stand before me."
Isaiah,48,14,"“All of you, come here and listen to me.
Did any of the false gods say these things would happen? No!
The LORD’s friend will do what he wants
to Babylon and the Chaldeans."
Isaiah,48,15,"“I told you that I would call him.
I will lead him,
and I will make him succeed."
Isaiah,48,16,"Come here and listen to me!
I was there when Babylon began as a nation.
And from the beginning, I spoke clearly
so that people could know what I said.”
Now, the Lord GOD sends me and his Spirit to tell you these things."
Isaiah,48,17,"The LORD, the Savior, the Holy One of Israel, says,
“I am the LORD your God.
I teach you for your own good.
I lead you in the way you should go."
Isaiah,48,18,"If you had obeyed me,
then peace would have come to you
like a full flowing river.
Good things would have come to you again and again,
like the waves of the sea."
Isaiah,48,19,"If you had obeyed me,
you would have had as many children as there are grains of sand.
And they would always have been mine
and would never have been destroyed.”"
Isaiah,48,20,"My people, leave Babylon!
My people, run from the Chaldeans!
Tell the news with joy.
Spread the news around the world.
Tell them,
“The LORD rescued his servant Jacob.”"
Isaiah,48,21,"They never got thirsty as he led them through the desert,
because he made water flow from a rock.
He split the rock,
and water flowed out."
Isaiah,48,22,"But the LORD also said,
“There is no peace for evil people.”"
Isaiah,49,1,"Hear me, people by the sea.
Listen to me, you faraway nations.
The LORD called me before I was born.
He called my name while I was still in my mother’s womb."
Isaiah,49,2,"He used me to speak for him.
He used me like a sharp sword,
but he also held me in his hand to protect me.
He used me like a sharp arrow,
but he also kept me safe in his arrow bag."
Isaiah,49,3,"He told me, “Israel, you are my servant.
I will do wonderful things with you.”"
Isaiah,49,4,"I said, “I worked hard for nothing.
I wore myself out, but I did nothing useful.
I used all my power,
but I did not really do anything.
So the LORD must decide what to do with me.
He must decide my reward.”"
Isaiah,49,5,"The LORD is the one who made me in my mother’s womb,
so that I could be his servant.
He wanted me to lead Jacob and Israel back to him.
The LORD gives me honor.
I get my strength from my God."
Isaiah,49,6,"And now he says, “You are a very important servant to me.
You must bring back to me the tribes of Jacob.
You must bring back the people of Israel who are still alive.
But I have something else for you to do that is even more important:
I will make you a light for the other nations.
You will show people all over the world the way to be saved.”"
Isaiah,49,7,"The LORD, the Holy Protector of Israel, speaks to his servant.
People hate that servant.
Nations despise him.
He is now a slave to rulers.
The Lord says to him,
“Kings will see you and stand to honor you.
Great leaders will bow down to you.”
This will happen for the LORD. The Holy One of Israel is the one who chose you, and he can be trusted."
Isaiah,49,8,"This is what the LORD says:
“There will be a special time when I show my kindness.
Then I will answer your prayers.
There will be a special day when I will save you.
Then I will help you and protect you.
And you will be the proof of my agreement with the people.
The country is destroyed now,
but you will give the land back to the people who own it."
Isaiah,49,9,"You will tell the prisoners,
‘Come out of your prison!’
You will tell those who are in darkness,
‘Come out of the dark!’
The people will eat along the road,

The mountains will be made flat,
and the low roads will be raised."
Isaiah,49,12,"“Look! People are coming to me from faraway places.
They are coming to me from the north and from the west.
They are coming to me from Aswan in Egypt.”"
Isaiah,50,1,"This is what the LORD says:
“People of Israel, you say that I divorced your mother, Jerusalem.
But where is the legal paper that proves I divorced her?
My children, did I owe money to someone?
Did I sell you to pay a debt?
No, you were sold because of the bad things you did.
Your mother was sent away because of the bad things you did."
Isaiah,50,2,"I came home and found no one there.
I called and called, but no one answered.
Do you think I cannot get you back?

Isaiah,50,10,People who respect the LORD also listen to his servant. That servant lives completely trusting in God without knowing what will happen. He really trusts in the also listen to his servant. That servant lives completely trusting in God without knowing what will happen. He really trusts in the LORD’s name and depends on his God.

Isaiah,51,1,“Some of you people try hard to live good lives. You go to the LORD for help. Listen to me. You should look at Abraham your father. He is the rock you were cut from.

Isaiah,51,3,"In the same way, the LORD will bless Zion. He will feel sorry for her and her people, and he will do something great for her. He will turn the desert into a garden.

He will turn the desert into a garden. It will be like the Garden of Eden. The land was empty, but it will become like the LORD’s garden. People there will be very happy.

Jerusalem, get up!
The LORD was very angry with you.
So you were punished.
It was like a cup of poison you had to drink,
and you drank it all."

Isaiah,51,19,"Troubles came to you, Jerusalem, in pairs: Your land was destroyed and lies in ruins, and your people suffered from famine and war.
But no one felt sorry for you or showed you mercy."
Isaiah,51,20,"Your people became weak. They fell on the ground and lay there. They were lying on every street corner, like animals caught in a net. They were punished by the LORD’s anger until they could not accept any more punishment. When God said he would give them more punishment, they became very weak."
Isaiah,51,21,"Listen to me, poor Jerusalem. You are weak like a drunk, but you are not drunk from wine. You are weak from that “cup of poison.”"

Isaiah,51,23,"I will now use my anger to punish the people who hurt you. They tried to kill you. They told you, ‘Bow down before us, and we will walk on you.’ They forced you to bow down before them, and then they walked on your back like dirt. You were like a road for them to walk on.”"

“You were not sold for money.
So I will not use money to set you free.”"
Isaiah,52,4,"The Lord GOD says, “First, my people went down to Egypt and became slaves. Then Assyria made them slaves."

Isaiah,52,13,"The Lord says, “Look, my servant will succeed in what he has to do, and he will be raised to a position of high honor."
Isaiah,52,14,It is true that many were shocked when they saw him. He was beaten so badly that he no longer looked like a man.
Isaiah,52,15,But it is also true that many nations will be amazed at him. Kings will look at him and be unable to speak. They will see what they had never been told. They will understand what they had never heard.”
Isaiah,53,1,Who really believed what we heard? Who saw in it the LORD’s great power?
Isaiah,53,2,"He was always close to the Lord. He grew up like a young plant, like a root growing in dry ground. There was nothing special or impressive about the way he looked, nothing we could see that would cause us to like him."
Isaiah,53,3,"People made fun of him, and even his friends left him. He was a man who suffered a lot of pain and sickness. We treated him like someone of no importance, like someone people will not even look at but turn away from in disgust."
Isaiah,53,4,"The fact is, it was our suffering he took on himself; he bore our pain. But we thought that God was punishing him, that God was beating him for something he did."
Isaiah,53,5,"But he was being punished for what we did. He was crushed because of our guilt. He took the punishment we deserved, and this brought us peace. We were healed because of his pain."
Isaiah,53,6,We had all wandered away like sheep. We had gone our own way. And yet the LORD put all our guilt on him.
Isaiah,53,7,"He was treated badly, but he never protested. He said nothing, like a lamb being led away to be killed. He was like a sheep that makes no sound as its wool is being cut off. He never opened his mouth to defend himself."
Isaiah,53,8,He was taken away by force and judged unfairly. The people of his time did not even notice that he was killed. But he was put to death for the sins of his people.
Isaiah,53,9,He had done no wrong to anyone. He had never even told a lie. But he was buried among the wicked. His tomb was with the rich.
Isaiah,53,10,"But the LORD was pleased with this humble servant who suffered such pain. Even after giving himself as an offering for sin, he will see his descendants and enjoy a long life. He will succeed in doing what the LORD wanted."
Isaiah,53,11,"After his suffering he will see the light, and he will be satisfied with what he experienced.
The Lord says, “My servant, who always does what is right, will make his people right with me; he will take away their sins."
Isaiah,53,12,"For this reason, I will treat him as one of my great people. I will give him the rewards of one who wins in battle, and he will share them with his powerful ones. I will do this because he gave his life for the people. He was considered a criminal, but the truth is, he carried away the sins of many. Now he will stand before me and speak for those who have sinned.”"

Your children will take over many nations
and live in the cities that were destroyed."
Isaiah,54,4,"Don’t be afraid!
You will not be disappointed.
People will not say bad things against you.

But you will forget that shame now.
You will not remember the shame you felt
when you lost your husband."
Isaiah,54,5,"Your real husband is the one who made you.
His name is the LORD All-Powerful.
The Holy One of Israel is your Protector,
and he is the God of all the earth!"

you were very sad.
You were like a young wife left all alone.
But the LORD has called you back to him.”
This is what your God says."
Isaiah,54,7,"“For a short time I turned away from you,
but with all my love I will welcome you again."
Isaiah,54,8,"I was so angry that for a while I did not want to see you.
But now I want to comfort you with kindness forever.”
The LORD your Savior said this."
Isaiah,54,9,"“Remember, in Noah’s time I punished the world with the flood.
But I made a promise to Noah that I would never again destroy the world with water.
In the same way, I promise that I will never again be angry with you
and say bad things to you."
Isaiah,54,10,"“The mountains may disappear,
and the hills may become dust,
but my faithful love will never leave you.
I will make peace with you,
and it will never end.”
The LORD who loves you said this."
Isaiah,54,11,"“You poor city!
Enemies came against you like storms,
and no one comforted you.
But I will rebuild you.
I will use a beautiful mortar to lay the stones of your walls.

And if any army tries to attack you, you will defeat them."
Isaiah,54,16,"“Look, I made the blacksmith. He blows on the fire to make it hotter. Then he takes the hot iron and makes the kind of tool he wants to make. In the same way, I made the ‘Destroyer’ to destroy things."
Isaiah,54,17,"“People will make weapons to fight against you, but their weapons will not defeat you. Some people will say things against you, but anyone who speaks against you will be proved wrong.”
The LORD says, “That is what my servants get! They get the good things that come from me, their LORD."
Isaiah,55,1,"“All you people who are thirsty, come!
Here is water for you to drink.
Don’t worry if you have no money.
Come, eat and drink until you are full!
You don’t need money.
The milk and wine are free."
Isaiah,55,2,"Why waste your money on something that is not real food?
Why should you work for something that does not really satisfy you?
Listen closely to me and you will eat what is good.
You will enjoy the food that satisfies your soul."
Isaiah,55,3,"Listen closely to what I say.
Listen to me so that you will live.
I will make an agreement with you that will last forever.
It will be an agreement you can trust, like the one I made with David—
a promise to love him and be loyal to him forever."
Isaiah,55,4,"I made David a witness of my power for all nations.
I promised him that he would become a ruler and commander of many nations.”"
Isaiah,55,5,"There are nations in places you don’t know,
but you will call for them to come.
They don’t know you,
but they will run to you.
This will happen because the LORD, your God, wants it.
It will happen because the Holy One of Israel honors you."
Isaiah,55,6,"So you should look for the LORD
before it is too late.
You should call to him now,
while he is near."
Isaiah,55,7,"Evil people should stop living evil lives.
They should stop thinking bad thoughts.
They should come to the LORD again,
and he will comfort them.
They should come to our God
because he will freely forgive them."

Your ways are not like mine."

so my ways are higher than your ways,
and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts."
Isaiah,55,10,"“Rain and snow fall from the sky

Then the ground causes the plants to sprout and grow,

My words make the things happen that I want to happen.
They succeed in doing what I send them to do."
Isaiah,55,12,"“So you will go out from there with joy.
You will be led out in peace.
When you come to the mountains and hills, they will begin singing.
All the trees in the fields will clap their hands."

Myrtle trees will grow where there were weeds.
All this will happen to make the LORD known,
to be a permanent reminder of his goodness and power.”"
Isaiah,56,1,"The LORD said these things, “Be fair to all people. Do what is right, because soon my salvation will come to you. My goodness will soon be shown to the whole world."
Isaiah,56,2,I will bless those who refuse to do wrong and who obey the law about the Sabbath.”
Isaiah,56,3,"Some foreigners will choose to follow the LORD. They should not say, “The . They should not say, “The LORD will not really accept me like the rest of his people.” A eunuch should not say, “I am only a dry piece of wood. I cannot have any children.”"
Isaiah,56,4,"They should not say that because the LORD says, “Some eunuchs obey the laws about the Sabbath. They choose to do what I want, and they follow my agreement."
Isaiah,56,5,"So I will put a memorial stone in my Temple for them. Their name will be remembered in my city! Yes, I will give those eunuchs something better than sons and daughters. I will give them a name that will last forever! They will not be cut off from my people."
Isaiah,56,6,"“Some foreigners have chosen to follow the LORD. They do this so that they can serve him and love his name and be his servants. They keep the Sabbath as a special day of worship, and they will continue to follow closely my agreement."

Oh, they love to sleep."
Isaiah,56,11,"They are like hungry dogs.
They are never satisfied.
The shepherds don’t know what they are doing.
Like their sheep, they have all wandered away.
They are greedy.
All they want is to satisfy themselves."
Isaiah,56,12,"They come and say,
“I will drink some wine.
I will drink some beer.
I will do the same thing tomorrow,
but I will drink even more.”"
Isaiah,57,1,"All the good people are gone,
and no one even noticed.
The loyal followers were gathered up,
but no one knows why.
The reason they were gathered up
is that trouble is coming."

Isaiah,57,3,"“Come here, you children of witches.

under every green tree.
You kill children by every stream
and sacrifice them in the rocky places."
Isaiah,57,6,"You love to worship the smooth rocks in the rivers.
You pour wine on them to worship them.
You give sacrifices to them, but those rocks are all you get.
Do you think this makes me happy?"
Isaiah,57,7,"You make your bed on every hill
and high mountain.
You go up to those places
and offer sacrifices."
Isaiah,57,8,"You hide the things that help you remember me
behind the doors and doorframes.

You found new strength,
because you enjoyed them."
Isaiah,57,11,"You did not remember me.
You did not even notice me!
So who were you worrying about?
Who were you afraid of?
Why did you lie?
Look, I have been quiet for a long time.
Is that why you didn’t honor me?"
Isaiah,57,12,"I could tell about your ‘good works’ and all the ‘religious’ things you do,
but that will not help you."
Isaiah,57,13,"When you need help,
you cry to those false gods that you have gathered around you.
Let them help you!

I will give new life to those who are sorry for their sins."

I will not always be angry.
If I continued to show my anger,
then the human spirit, the life I gave them, would die before me."

so I punished them.
I turned away from them
because I was angry.
But they continued to do wrong.
They did whatever they wanted."
Isaiah,57,18,"I have seen their way of life, but I will heal them.
I will guide and comfort them and those who mourn for them."
Isaiah,57,19,"I will teach them a new word: peace.
I will give peace to those who are near and to those who are far away.
I will heal them.”
The LORD himself said this."
Isaiah,57,20,"But evil people are like the angry ocean.

They are angry, and like the ocean,
they stir up mud."
Isaiah,57,21,"My God says,
“There is no peace for evil people.”"
Isaiah,58,1,"Shout as loud as you can and don’t stop.
Shout like a trumpet!
Tell the people what they did wrong.
Tell the family of Jacob about their sins."
Isaiah,58,2,"They still come every day to worship me,
acting as if they want to learn my ways.
They pretend to be a nation that lives right
and obeys the commands of their God.
They ask me to judge them fairly.
They want their God to be near them."
Isaiah,58,3,"They say, “We fast to show honor to you. Why don’t you see us? We starve our bodies to show honor to you. Why don’t you notice us?”
But God says, “You do things to please yourselves on those special days of fasting. And you punish your servants, not your own bodies."
Isaiah,58,4,"You are hungry, but not for food. You are hungry for arguing and fighting, not for bread. You are hungry to hit people with your evil hands. This is not the way to fast if you want your prayers to be heard in heaven!"
Isaiah,58,5,Do you think I want to see people punish their bodies on those days of fasting? Do you think I want people to look sad and bow their heads like dead plants? Do you think I want people to wear mourning clothes and sit in ashes to show their sadness? That is what you do on your days of fasting. Do you think that is what the LORD wants?
Isaiah,58,6,“I will tell you the kind of day I want—a day to set people free. I want a day that you take the burdens off others. I want a day when you set troubled people free and you take the burdens from their shoulders.
Isaiah,58,7,"I want you to share your food with the hungry. I want you to find the poor who don’t have homes and bring them into your own homes. When you see people who have no clothes, give them your clothes! Don’t hide from your relatives when they need help.”"
Isaiah,58,8,"If you do these things, your light will begin to shine like the light of dawn. Then your wounds will heal. Your “Goodness” will walk in front of you, and the Glory of the LORD will come following behind you."
Isaiah,58,9,"Then you will call to the LORD, and he will answer you. You will cry out to him, and he will say, “Here I am.”
Stop causing trouble and putting burdens on people. Stop saying things to hurt people or accusing them of things they didn’t do."

Isaiah,58,12,"Your cities have been destroyed for many years, but you will rebuild them and their foundations will last for a long time. You will be called “Fence Fixer” and “Builder of Roads and Houses.”"
Isaiah,58,13,That will happen when you stop sinning against God’s law about the Sabbath and when you stop doing things to please yourself on that special day. You should call the Sabbath a happy day. You should honor the LORD’s special day by not saying and doing things that you do every other day of the week.
Isaiah,58,14,"Then you could enjoy the LORD. As the . As the LORD himself says, “I could carry you up to the highest mountain and let you enjoy the land that I gave to your father Jacob.”"
Isaiah,59,1,"Look, the LORD’s power is enough to save you. He can hear you when you ask him for help."
Isaiah,59,2,It is your sins that separate you from your God. He turns away from you when he sees them.
Isaiah,59,3,That’s because your hands are covered with blood from the people you murdered. You tell lies and say evil things.
Isaiah,59,4,"You can’t be trusted, even in court. You lie about each other and depend on false arguments to win your cases. You create pain and produce wickedness."
Isaiah,59,5,"You hatch evil, like eggs from a poisonous snake. Anyone who eats the eggs will die. And if you break one of them open, a poisonous snake will come out.
Your lies are like spider webs."
Isaiah,59,6,"They cannot be used for clothes, and you cannot cover yourself with them.
Your hands are always busy sinning and hurting others."
Isaiah,59,7,Your feet run toward evil. You are always ready to kill innocent people. You think of nothing but evil. Everywhere you go you cause trouble and ruin.

There is only darkness around us,
so we must wait for the light.
We hope for a bright light,
but all we have is darkness."
Isaiah,59,10,"We are like people without eyes.
We walk into walls like blind people.
We stumble and fall as if it was night.
Even in the daylight, we cannot see.
At noontime, we fall like dead men."
Isaiah,59,11,"We are always complaining;
we growl like bears and moan like doves.
We are waiting for justice,
but there is none.
We are waiting to be saved,
but salvation is still far away."
Isaiah,59,12,"That’s because we committed crimes against our God.
Our own sins speak out against us.
We know we are guilty.
We know we have sinned."
Isaiah,59,13,"We rebelled against the LORD
and lied to him.
We turned away from our God
and left him.
We planned to hurt others
and to rebel against God.
From hearts filled with lies,
we talked about it and made our plans."
Isaiah,59,14,"We pushed Justice away.
Fairness stands off in the distance.
Truth has fallen in the streets.
Goodness is not allowed in the city."
Isaiah,59,15,"Loyalty is gone,
and people who try to do good are robbed.
The LORD looked and saw there was no justice.
He did not like what he saw."
Isaiah,59,16,"He did not see anyone speak up for the people.
He was shocked to see that no one stood up for them.

I will punish them using what they are most afraid of.
I will do this because I called to them,
but they did not answer.
I spoke to them,
but they did not listen.
They did what I said is evil.
They chose to do what I did not like.”"
Isaiah,66,5,"You who obey the LORD’s commands,
