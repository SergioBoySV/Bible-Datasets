Exodus,1,1,"THESE ARE the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt with Jacob, each with his household:"
Exodus,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,"
Exodus,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,"
Exodus,1,4,"Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher."
Exodus,1,5,All the offspring of Jacob were seventy persons; Joseph was already in Egypt.
Exodus,1,6,"Then Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation."
Exodus,1,7,"But the descendants of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, and the land was full of them."
Exodus,1,8,Now a new king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph.
Exodus,1,9,"He said to his people, Behold, the Israelites are too many and too mighty for us [and they outnumber us both in people and in strength]."
Exodus,1,10,"Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply more and, should war befall us, they join our enemies, fight against us, and escape out of the land."
Exodus,1,11,So they set over [the Israelites] taskmasters to afflict and oppress them with [increased] burdens. And [the Israelites] built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.
Exodus,1,12,"But the more [the Egyptians] oppressed them, the more they multiplied and expanded, so that [the Egyptians] were vexed and alarmed because of the Israelites."
Exodus,1,13,And the Egyptians reduced the Israelites to severe slavery.
Exodus,1,14,"They made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar, brick, and all kinds of work in the field. All their service was with harshness and severity."
Exodus,1,15,"Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, of whom one was named Shiprah and the other Puah,"
Exodus,1,16,"When you act as midwives to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, she shall live."
Exodus,1,17,"But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded, but let the male babies live."
Exodus,1,18,"So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, Why have you done this thing and allowed the male children to live?"
Exodus,1,19,"The midwives answered Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; they are vigorous and quickly delivered; their babies are born before the midwife comes to them."
Exodus,1,20,So God dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and became very strong.
Exodus,1,21,"And because the midwives revered and feared God, He made them households [of their own]."
Exodus,1,22,"Then Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son born [to the Hebrews] you shall cast into the river [Nile], but every daughter you shall allow to live."
Exodus,2,1,"NOW [Amram] a man of the house of Levi [the priestly tribe] went and took as his wife [Jochebed] a daughter of Levi. [Exod. 6:18, 20; Num. 26:59.]"
Exodus,2,2,"And the woman became pregnant and bore a son; and when she saw that he was [exceedingly] beautiful, she hid him three months. [Acts 7:20; Heb. 11:23.]"
Exodus,2,3,"And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark or basket made of bulrushes or papyrus [making it watertight by] daubing it with bitumen and pitch. Then she put the child in it and laid it among the rushes by the brink of the river [Nile]."
Exodus,2,4,And his sister [Miriam] stood some distance away to learn what would be done to him.
Exodus,2,5,"Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, and her maidens walked along the bank; she saw the ark among the rushes and sent her maid to fetch it."
Exodus,2,6,"When she opened it, she saw the child; and behold, the baby cried. And she took pity on him and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children!"
Exodus,2,7,"Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call a nurse of the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?"
Exodus,2,8,"Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the girl went and called the child's mother."
Exodus,2,9,"Then Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages. So the woman took the child and nursed it."
Exodus,2,10,"And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. And she called him Moses, for she said, Because I drew him out of the water."
Exodus,2,11,"One day, after Moses was grown, it happened that he went out to his brethren and looked at their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of [Moses'] brethren."
Exodus,2,12,"He looked this way and that way, and when he saw no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand."
Exodus,2,13,"He went out the second day and saw two Hebrew men quarreling and fighting; and he said to the unjust aggressor, Why are you striking your comrade?"
Exodus,2,14,"And the man said, Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian? Then Moses was afraid and thought, Surely this thing is known."
Exodus,2,15,"When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh's presence and took refuge in the land of Midian, where he sat down by a well."
Exodus,2,16,"Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock."
Exodus,2,17,The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock.
Exodus,2,18,"And when they came to Reuel [Jethro] their father, he said, How is it that you have come so soon today?"
Exodus,2,19,"They said, An Egyptian delivered us from the shepherds; also he drew water for us and watered the flock."
Exodus,2,20,"He said to his daughters, Where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread."
Exodus,2,21,And Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
Exodus,2,22,"And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom [expulsion, or a stranger there]; for he said, I have been a stranger and a sojourner in a foreign land."
Exodus,2,23,"However, after a long time [nearly forty years] the king of Egypt died; and the Israelites were sighing and groaning because of the bondage. They kept crying, and their cry because of slavery ascended to God."
Exodus,2,24,"And God heard their sighing and groaning and [earnestly] remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob."
Exodus,2,25,"God saw the Israelites and took knowledge of them and concerned Himself about them [knowing all, understanding, remembering all]. [Ps. 56:8, 9; 139:2.]"
Exodus,3,1,"NOW MOSES kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the back or west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb or Sinai, the mountain of God."
Exodus,3,2,"The Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, yet was not consumed."
Exodus,3,3,"And Moses said, I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burned."
Exodus,3,4,"And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush and said, Moses, Moses! And he said, Here am I."
Exodus,3,5,"God said, Do not come near; put your shoes off your feet, for the place on which you stand is holy ground."
Exodus,3,6,"Also He said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God."
Exodus,3,7,"And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters and oppressors; for I know their sorrows and sufferings and trials."
Exodus,3,8,"And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand and power of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a land good and large, a land flowing with milk and honey [a land of plenty]â€“to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite."
Exodus,3,9,"Now behold, the cry of the Israelites has come to Me, and I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them."
Exodus,3,10,"Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring forth My people, the Israelites, out of Egypt."
Exodus,3,11,"And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"
Exodus,3,12,"God said, I will surely be with you; and this shall be the sign to you that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain [Horeb, or Sinai]."
Exodus,3,13,"And Moses said to God, Behold, when I come to the Israelites and say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they say to me, What is His name? What shall I say to them?"
Exodus,3,14,"And God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM and WHAT I AM, and I WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE; and He said, You shall say this to the Israelites: I AM has sent me to you!"
Exodus,3,15,"God said also to Moses, This shall you say to the Israelites: The Lord, the God of your fathers, of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has sent me to you! This is My name forever, and by this name I am to be remembered to all generations."
Exodus,3,16,"Go, gather the elders of Israel together [the mature teachers and tribal leaders], and say to them, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in Egypt;"
Exodus,3,17,"And I have declared that I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey."
Exodus,3,18,"And [the elders] shall believe and obey your voice; and you shall go, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt and you shall say to him, The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us; and now let us go, we beseech you, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God."
Exodus,3,19,"And I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go [unless forced to do so], no, not by a mighty hand."
Exodus,3,20,So I will stretch out My hand and smite Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in it; and after that he will let you go.
Exodus,3,21,"And I will give this people favor and respect in the sight of the Egyptians; and it shall be that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed."
Exodus,3,22,"But every woman shall [insistently] solicit of her neighbor and of her that may be residing at her house jewels and articles of silver and gold, and garments, which you shall put on your sons and daughters; and you shall strip the Egyptians [of belongings due to you]."
Exodus,4,1,"AND MOSES answered, But behold, they will not believe me or listen to and obey my voice; for they will say, The Lord has not appeared to you."
Exodus,4,2,"And the Lord said to him, What is that in your hand? And he said, A rod."
Exodus,4,3,"And He said, Cast it on the ground. And he did so and it became a serpent [the symbol of royal and divine power worn on the crown of the Pharaohs]; and Moses fled from before it."
Exodus,4,4,"And the Lord said to Moses, Put forth your hand and take it by the tail. And he stretched out his hand and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand,"
Exodus,4,5,"[This you shall do, said the Lord] that the elders may believe that the Lord, the God of their fathers, of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has indeed appeared to you."
Exodus,4,6,"The Lord said also to him, Put your hand into your bosom. He put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow."
Exodus,4,7,"[God] said, Put your hand into your bosom again. So he put his hand back into his bosom, and when he took it out, behold, it was restored as the rest of his flesh."
Exodus,4,8,"[Then God said] If they will not believe you or heed the voice or the testimony of the first sign, they may believe the voice or the witness of the second sign."
Exodus,4,9,"But if they will also not believe these two signs or heed your voice, you shall take some water of the river [Nile] and pour it upon the dry land; and the water which you take out of the river [Nile] shall become blood on the dry land."
Exodus,4,10,"And Moses said to the Lord, O Lord, I am not eloquent or a man of words, neither before nor since You have spoken to Your servant; for I am slow of speech and have a heavy and awkward tongue."
Exodus,4,11,"And the Lord said to him, Who has made man's mouth? Or who makes the dumb, or the deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? Is it not I, the Lord?"
Exodus,4,12,"Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and will teach you what you shall say."
Exodus,4,13,"And he said, Oh, my Lord, I pray You, send by the hand of [some other] whom You will [send]."
Exodus,4,14,"Then the anger of the Lord blazed against Moses; He said, Is there not Aaron your brother, the Levite? I know he can speak well. Also, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be overjoyed."
Exodus,4,15,You must speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what you shall do.
Exodus,4,16,"He shall speak for you to the people, acting as a mouthpiece for you, and you shall be as God to him."
Exodus,4,17,And you shall take this rod in your hand with which you shall work the signs [that prove I sent you].
Exodus,4,18,"And Moses went away and, returning to Jethro his father-in-law, said to him, Let me go back, I pray you, to my relatives in Egypt to see whether they are still alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace."
Exodus,4,19,"The Lord said to Moses in Midian, Go back to Egypt; for all the men who were seeking your life [for killing the Egyptian] are dead. [Exod. 2:11, 12.]"
Exodus,4,20,"And Moses took his wife and his sons and set them on donkeys, and he returned to the land of Egypt; and Moses took the rod of God in his hand."
Exodus,4,21,"And the Lord said to Moses, When you return into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all those miracles and wonders which I have put in your hand; but I will make him stubborn and harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go."
Exodus,4,22,"And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus says the Lord, Israel is My son, even My firstborn."
Exodus,4,23,"And I say to you, Let My son go, that he may serve Me; and if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay your son, your firstborn."
Exodus,4,24,"Along the way at a [resting-] place, the Lord met [Moses] and sought to kill him [made him acutely and almost fatally ill]."
Exodus,4,25,"[Now apparently he had failed to circumcise one of his sons, his wife being opposed to it; but seeing his life in such danger] Zipporah took a flint knife and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it to touch [Moses'] feet, and said, Surely a husband of blood you are to me!"
Exodus,4,26,"When He let [Moses] alone [to recover], Zipporah said, A husband of blood are you because of the circumcision."
Exodus,4,27,"The Lord said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mountain of God [Horeb, or Sinai] and kissed him."
Exodus,4,28,"Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord with which He had sent him, and all the signs with which He had charged him."
Exodus,4,29,Moses and Aaron went and gathered together [in Egypt] all the elders of the Israelites.
Exodus,4,30,"Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people."
Exodus,4,31,"And the people believed; and when they heard that the Lord had visited the Israelites, and that He had looked [in compassion] upon their affliction, they bowed their heads and worshiped."
Exodus,5,1,"AFTERWARD MOSES and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh, Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, Let My people go, that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness."
Exodus,5,2,"But Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go."
Exodus,5,3,"And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us; let us go, we pray you, three days' journey into the desert and sacrifice to the Lord our God, lest He fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword."
Exodus,5,4,"The king of Egypt said to Moses and Aaron, Why do you take the people from their jobs? Get to your burdens!"
Exodus,5,5,"Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and you make them rest from their burdens!"
Exodus,5,6,"The very same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers,"
Exodus,5,7,You shall no more give the people straw to make brick; let them go and gather straw for themselves.
Exodus,5,8,"But the number of the bricks which they made before you shall still require of them; you shall not diminish it in the least. For they are idle; that is why they cry, Let us go and sacrifice to our God."
Exodus,5,9,Let heavier work be laid upon the men that they may labor at it and pay no attention to lying words.
Exodus,5,10,"The taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they said to the people, Thus says Pharaoh, I will not give you straw."
Exodus,5,11,"Go, get straw where you can find it; but your work shall not be diminished in the least."
Exodus,5,12,So the people were scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather the short stubble instead of straw.
Exodus,5,13,"And the taskmasters were urgent, saying, Finish your work, your daily quotas, as when there was straw."
Exodus,5,14,"And the Hebrew foremen, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, Why have you not fulfilled all your quota of making bricks yesterday and today, as before?"
Exodus,5,15,"Then the Hebrew foremen came to Pharaoh and cried, Why do you deal like this with your servants?"
Exodus,5,16,"No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, Make bricks! And behold, your servants are beaten, but the fault is in your own people."
Exodus,5,17,"But [Pharaoh] said, You are idle, lazy and idle! That is why you say, Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord."
Exodus,5,18,"Get out now and get to work; for no straw shall be given you, yet you shall deliver the full quota of bricks."
Exodus,5,19,"And the Hebrew foremen saw that they were in an evil situation when it was said, You shall not diminish in the least your full daily quota of bricks."
Exodus,5,20,"And the foremen met Moses and Aaron, who were standing in the way as they came forth from Pharaoh."
Exodus,5,21,"And the foremen said to them, The Lord look upon you and judge, because you have made us a rotten stench to be detested by Pharaoh and his servants and have put a sword in their hand to slay us."
Exodus,5,22,"Then Moses turned again to the Lord and said, O Lord, why have You dealt evil to this people? Why did You ever send me?"
Exodus,5,23,"For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done evil to this people, neither have You delivered Your people at all."
Exodus,6,1,"THEN THE Lord said to Moses, Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for [compelled] by a strong hand he will [not only] let them go, but he will drive them out of his land with a strong hand."
Exodus,6,2,"And God said to Moses, I am the Lord."
Exodus,6,3,"I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty [El-Shaddai], but by My name the Lord [Yahwehâ€“the redemptive name of God] I did not make Myself known to them [in acts and great miracles]. [Gen. 17:1.]"
Exodus,6,4,"I have also established My covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their temporary residence in which they were strangers."
Exodus,6,5,"I have also heard the groaning of the Israelites whom the Egyptians have enslaved; and I have [earnestly] remembered My covenant [with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob]."
Exodus,6,6,"Accordingly, say to the Israelites, I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will free you from their bondage, and I will rescue you with an outstretched arm [with special and vigorous action] and by mighty acts of judgment."
Exodus,6,7,"And I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and you shall know that it is I, the Lord your God, Who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians."
Exodus,6,8,"And I will bring you into the land concerning which I lifted up My hand and swore that I would give it to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage. I am the Lord [you have the pledge of My changeless omnipotence and faithfulness]."
Exodus,6,9,"Moses told this to the Israelites, but they refused to listen to Moses because of their impatience and anguish of spirit and because of their cruel bondage."
Exodus,6,10,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Exodus,6,11,"Go in, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his land."
Exodus,6,12,"But Moses said to the Lord, Behold, [my own people] the Israelites have not listened to me; how then shall Pharaoh give heed to me, who am of deficient and impeded speech?"
Exodus,6,13,"But the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, and gave them a command for the Israelites and for Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt."
Exodus,6,14,"These are the heads of their clans. The sons of Reuben, Israel's firstborn: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben."
Exodus,6,15,"The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon."
Exodus,6,16,"These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their births: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; and Levi lived 137 years."
Exodus,6,17,"The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimi, by their families."
Exodus,6,18,"The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel; and Kohath lived 133 years."
Exodus,6,19,The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of Levi according to their generations.
Exodus,6,20,"Amram took Jochebed his father's sister as wife, and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and Amram lived 137 years."
Exodus,6,21,"The sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri."
Exodus,6,22,"The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri."
Exodus,6,23,"Aaron took Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, as wife; she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
Exodus,6,24,"The sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These are the families of the Korahites."
Exodus,6,25,"Eleazar, Aaron's son, took one of the daughters of Putiel as wife; and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites by their families."
Exodus,6,26,"These are the [same] Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said, Bring out the Israelites from the land of Egypt by their hosts,"
Exodus,6,27,And who spoke to [the] Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt; these are that Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,6,28,"On the day when the Lord spoke to Moses in Egypt,"
Exodus,6,29,"The Lord said to Moses, I am the Lord; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you."
Exodus,6,30,"But Moses said to the Lord, Behold, I am of deficient and impeded speech; how then shall Pharaoh listen to me?"
Exodus,7,1,"THE Lord said to Moses, Behold, I make you as God to Pharaoh [to declare My will and purpose to him]; and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet."
Exodus,7,2,"You shall speak all that I command you, and Aaron your brother shall tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his land."
Exodus,7,3,"And I will make Pharaoh's heart stubborn and hard, and multiply My signs, My wonders, and miracles in the land of Egypt."
Exodus,7,4,"But Pharaoh will not listen to you, and I will lay My hand upon Egypt and bring forth My hosts, My people the Israelites, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment."
Exodus,7,5,The Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I stretch forth My hand upon Egypt and bring out the Israelites from among them.
Exodus,7,6,"And Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded them."
Exodus,7,7,Now Moses was 80 years old and Aaron 83 years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.
Exodus,7,8,"And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron,"
Exodus,7,9,"When Pharaoh says to you, Prove [your authority] by a miracle, then tell Aaron, Throw your rod down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent."
Exodus,7,10,"So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did as the Lord had commanded; Aaron threw down his rod before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent."
Exodus,7,11,"Then Pharaoh called for the wise men [skilled in magic and divination] and the sorcerers (wizards and jugglers). And they also, these magicians of Egypt, did similar things with their enchantments and secret arts."
Exodus,7,12,For they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents; but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
Exodus,7,13,"But Pharaoh's heart was hardened and stubborn and he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had said."
Exodus,7,14,"Then the Lord said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hard and stubborn; he refuses to let the people go."
Exodus,7,15,Go to Pharaoh in the morning; he will be going out to the water; wait for him by the river's brink; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand.
Exodus,7,16,"And say to him, The Lord, the God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying, Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness; and behold, heretofore you have not listened."
Exodus,7,17,"Thus says the Lord, In this you shall know, recognize, and understand that I am the Lord: behold, I will smite with the rod in my hand the waters in the [Nile] River, and they shall be turned to blood."
Exodus,7,18,"The fish in the river shall die, the river shall become foul smelling, and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink from it."
Exodus,7,19,"And the Lord said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your rod and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their streams, rivers, pools, and ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, in containers both of wood and of stone."
Exodus,7,20,"Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded; [Aaron] lifted up the rod and smote the waters in the river in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and all the waters in the river were turned to blood."
Exodus,7,21,"And the fish in the river died; and the river became foul smelling, and the Egyptians could not drink its water, and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,7,22,"But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their enchantments and secret arts; and Pharaoh's heart was made hard and obstinate, and he did not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had said."
Exodus,7,23,And Pharaoh turned and went into his house; neither did he take even this to heart.
Exodus,7,24,"And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the [Nile]."
Exodus,7,25,Seven days passed after the Lord had smitten the river.
Exodus,8,1,"THEN THE Lord said to Moses, Go to Pharaoh and say to him, Thus says the Lord, Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,8,2,"And if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite your entire land with frogs;"
Exodus,8,3,"And the river shall swarm with frogs which shall go up and come into your house, into your bedchamber and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants and upon your people, and into your ovens, your kneading bowls, and your dough."
Exodus,8,4,And the frogs shall come up on you and on your people and all your servants.
Exodus,8,5,"And the Lord said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers, the streams and canals, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,6,"So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land."
Exodus,8,7,"But the magicians did the same thing with their enchantments and secret arts, and brought up [more] frogs upon the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,8,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the Lord, that He may take away the frogs from me and my people; and I will let the people go that they may sacrifice to the Lord."
Exodus,8,9,"Moses said to Pharaoh, Glory over me in this: dictate when I shall pray [to the Lord] for you, your servants, and your people, that the frogs may be destroyed from you and your houses and remain only in the river."
Exodus,8,10,"And [Pharaoh] said, Tomorrow. [Moses] said, Let it be as you say, that you may know that there is no one like the Lord our God."
Exodus,8,11,And the frogs shall depart from you and your houses and from your servants and your people; they shall remain in the river only.
Exodus,8,12,"So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the Lord [as he had agreed with Pharaoh] concerning the frogs which He had brought against him."
Exodus,8,13,"And the Lord did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courtyards and villages, and out of the fields."
Exodus,8,14,"[The people] gathered them together in heaps, and the land was loathsome and stank."
Exodus,8,15,"But when Pharaoh saw that there was temporary relief, he made his heart stubborn and hard and would not listen or heed them, just as the Lord had said."
Exodus,8,16,"Then the Lord said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out your rod and strike the dust of the ground, that it may become biting gnats or mosquitoes throughout all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,17,"And they did so; Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth, and there came biting gnats or mosquitoes on man and beast; all the dust of the land became biting gnats or mosquitoes throughout all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,18,"The magicians tried by their enchantments and secret arts to bring forth gnats or mosquitoes, but they could not; and there were gnats or mosquitoes on man and beast."
Exodus,8,19,"Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God! But Pharaoh's heart was hardened and strong and he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had said."
Exodus,8,20,"Then the Lord said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh as he comes forth to the water; and say to him, Thus says the Lord, Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,8,21,"Else, if you will not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms [of bloodsucking gadflies] upon you, your servants, and your people, and into your houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms [of bloodsucking gadflies], and also the ground on which they stand."
Exodus,8,22,"But on that day I will sever and set apart the land of Goshen in which My people dwell, that no swarms [of gadflies] shall be there, so that you may know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth."
Exodus,8,23,And I will put a division and a sign of deliverance between My people and your people. By tomorrow shall this sign be in evidence.
Exodus,8,24,And the Lord did so; and there came heavy and oppressive swarms [of bloodsucking gadflies] into the house of Pharaoh and his servants' houses; and in all of Egypt the land was corrupted and ruined by reason of the great invasion [of gadflies].
Exodus,8,25,"And Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Go, sacrifice to your God [here] in the land [of Egypt]."
Exodus,8,26,"And Moses said, It is not suitable or right to do that; for the animals the Egyptians hold sacred and will not permit to be slain are those which we are accustomed to sacrifice to the Lord our God; if we did this before the eyes of the Egyptians, would they not stone us?"
Exodus,8,27,"We will go a three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the Lord our God, as He will command us."
Exodus,8,28,"So Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. Entreat [your God] for me."
Exodus,8,29,"Moses said, I go out from you, and I will entreat the Lord that the swarms [of bloodsucking gadflies] may depart from Pharaoh, his servants, and his people tomorrow; only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord."
Exodus,8,30,So Moses went out from Pharaoh and entreated the Lord.
Exodus,8,31,"And the Lord did as Moses had spoken: He removed the swarms [of attacking gadflies] from Pharaoh, from his servants, and his people; there remained not one."
Exodus,8,32,"But Pharaoh hardened his heart and made it stubborn this time also, nor would he let the people go."
Exodus,9,1,"THEN THE Lord said to Moses, Go to Pharaoh and tell him, Thus says the Lord God of the Hebrews: Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,9,2,"If you refuse to let them go and still hold them,"
Exodus,9,3,"Behold, the hand of the Lord [will fall] upon your livestock which are out in the field, upon the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds and the flocks; there shall be a very severe plague."
Exodus,9,4,"But the Lord shall make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the Israelites."
Exodus,9,5,"And the Lord set a time, saying, Tomorrow the Lord will do this thing in the land."
Exodus,9,6,"And the Lord did that the next day, and all [kinds of] the livestock of Egypt died; but of the livestock of the Israelites not one died."
Exodus,9,7,"Pharaoh sent to find out, and behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened [his mind was set] and he did not let the people go."
Exodus,9,8,"The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, Take handfuls of ashes or soot from the brickkiln and let Moses sprinkle them toward the heavens in the sight of Pharaoh."
Exodus,9,9,"And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and become boils breaking out in sores on man and beast in all the land [occupied by the Egyptians]."
Exodus,9,10,"So they took ashes or soot of the kiln and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses threw them toward the sky, and it became boils erupting in sores on man and beast."
Exodus,9,11,And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of their boils; for the boils were on the magicians and all the Egyptians.
Exodus,9,12,"But the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, making it strong and obstinate, and he did not listen to them or heed them, just as the Lord had told Moses."
Exodus,9,13,"Then the Lord said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh and say to him, Thus says the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,9,14,"For this time I will send all My plagues upon your heart and upon your servants and your people, that you may recognize and know that there is none like Me in all the earth."
Exodus,9,15,"For by now I could have put forth My hand and have struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth."
Exodus,9,16,"But for this very purpose have I let you live, that I might show you My power, and that My name may be declared throughout all the earth. [Rom. 9:17-24.]"
Exodus,9,17,"Since you are still exalting yourself [in haughty defiance] against My people by not letting them go,"
Exodus,9,18,"Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very heavy and dreadful fall of hail, such as has not been in Egypt from its founding until now."
Exodus,9,19,"Send therefore now and gather your cattle in hastily, and all that you have in the field; for every man and beast that is in the field and is not brought home shall be struck by the hail and shall die."
Exodus,9,20,Then he who feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his livestock flee into the houses and shelters.
Exodus,9,21,And he who ignored the word of the Lord left his servants and his livestock in the field.
Exodus,9,22,"The Lord said to Moses, Stretch forth your hand toward the heavens, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man and beast, and upon all the vegetation of the field, throughout the land of Egypt."
Exodus,9,23,"Then Moses stretched forth his rod toward the heavens, and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and fire (lightning) ran down to and along the ground, and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt."
Exodus,9,24,"So there was hail and fire flashing continually in the midst of the weighty hail, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation."
Exodus,9,25,"The hail struck down throughout all the land of Egypt everything that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail beat down all the vegetation of the field and shattered every tree of the field."
Exodus,9,26,"Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were, was there no hail."
Exodus,9,27,"And Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time; the Lord is in the right and I and my people are in the wrong."
Exodus,9,28,"Entreat the Lord, for there has been enough of these mighty thunderings and hail [these voices of God]; I will let you go; you shall stay here no longer."
Exodus,9,29,"Moses said to him, As soon as I leave the city, I will stretch out my hands to the Lord; the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail, that you may know that the earth is the Lord's."
Exodus,9,30,"But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet [reverently] fear the Lord God."
Exodus,9,31,"The flax and the barley were smitten and ruined, for the barley was in the ear and the flax in bloom."
Exodus,9,32,"But the wheat and spelt [another wheat] were not smitten, for they ripen late and were not grown up yet."
Exodus,9,33,"So Moses left the city and Pharaoh, and stretched forth his hands to the Lord; and the thunder and hail ceased, and rain was no longer poured upon the earth."
Exodus,9,34,"But when Pharaoh saw that the rain, the hail, and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet more, and toughened and stiffened his hard heart, he and his servants."
Exodus,9,35,"So Pharaoh's heart was strong and obstinate; he would not let the Israelites go, just as the Lord had said by Moses. [Exod. 4:21.]"
Exodus,10,1,"THE Lord said to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, for I have made his heart hard, and his servants' hearts, that I might show these My signs [of divine power] before him,"
Exodus,10,2,And that you may recount in the ears of your son and of your grandson what I have done in derision of the Egyptians and what things I have [repeatedly] done thereâ€“My signs [of divine power] done among themâ€“that you may recognize and know that I am the Lord.
Exodus,10,3,"So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus says the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, that they may serve Me."
Exodus,10,4,"For if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country."
Exodus,10,5,"And they shall cover the land so that one cannot see the ground; and they shall eat the remainder of what escaped and is left to you from the hail, and they shall eat every tree of yours that grows in the field;"
Exodus,10,6,"The locusts shall fill your houses and those of all your servants and of all the Egyptians, as neither your fathers nor your fathers' fathers have seen from their birth until this day. Then Moses departed from Pharaoh."
Exodus,10,7,"And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God; do you not yet understand and know that Egypt is destroyed?"
Exodus,10,8,"So Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh; and he said to them, Go, serve the Lord your God; but just who are to go?"
Exodus,10,9,"And Moses said, We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds [all of us and all we have], for we must hold a feast to the Lord."
Exodus,10,10,"Pharaoh said to them, Let the Lord be with you, if I ever let you go with your little ones! See, you have some evil purpose in mind."
Exodus,10,11,"Not so! You that are men, [without your families] go and serve the Lord, for that is what you want. And [Moses and Aaron] were driven from Pharaoh's presence."
Exodus,10,12,"Then the Lord said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt and eat all the vegetation of the land, all that the hail has left."
Exodus,10,13,"And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night; when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts."
Exodus,10,14,"And the locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled down on the whole country of Egypt, a very dreadful mass of them; never before were there such locusts as these, nor will there ever be again."
Exodus,10,15,"For they covered the whole land, so that the ground was darkened, and they ate every bit of vegetation of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left; there remained not a green thing of the trees or the plants of the field in all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,10,16,"Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron in haste. He said, I have sinned against the Lord your God and you."
Exodus,10,17,"Now therefore forgive my sin, I pray you, only this once, and entreat the Lord your God only that He may remove from me this [plague of] death."
Exodus,10,18,Then Moses left Pharaoh and entreated the Lord.
Exodus,10,19,"And the Lord turned a violent west wind, which lifted the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea; not one locust remained in all the country of Egypt."
Exodus,10,20,"But the Lord made Pharaoh's heart more strong and obstinate, and he would not let the Israelites go."
Exodus,10,21,"And the Lord said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward the heavens, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness which may be felt."
Exodus,10,22,"So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and for three days a thick darkness was all over the land of Egypt."
Exodus,10,23,"The Egyptians could not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days; but all the Israelites had natural light in their dwellings."
Exodus,10,24,"And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, Go, serve the Lord; let your little ones also go with you; it is only your flocks and your herds that must not go."
Exodus,10,25,"But Moses said, You must give into our hand also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God."
Exodus,10,26,"Our livestock also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind; for of them must we take to serve the Lord our God, and we know not with what we must serve the Lord until we arrive there."
Exodus,10,27,"But the Lord made Pharaoh's heart stronger and more stubborn, and he would not let them go."
Exodus,10,28,"And Pharaoh said to Moses, Get away from me! See that you never enter my presence again, for the day you see my face again you shall die!"
Exodus,10,29,"And Moses said, You have spoken truly; I will never see your face again."
Exodus,11,1,"THEN THE Lord said to Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more on Pharaoh and on Egypt; afterwards he will let you go. When he lets you go from here, he will thrust you out altogether."
Exodus,11,2,"Speak now in the hearing of the people, and let every man solicit and ask of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver and jewels of gold."
Exodus,11,3,"And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was exceedingly great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and of the people."
Exodus,11,4,"And Moses said, Thus says the Lord, About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt;"
Exodus,11,5,"And all the firstborn in the land [the pride, hope, and joy] of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the maidservant who is behind the hand mill, and all the firstborn of beasts."
Exodus,11,6,"There shall be a great cry in all the land of Egypt, such as has never been nor ever shall be again."
Exodus,11,7,"But against any of the Israelites shall not so much as a dog move his tongue against man or beast, that you may know that the Lord makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel."
Exodus,11,8,"And all these your servants shall come down to me and bow down to me, saying, Get out, and all the people who follow you! And after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in great anger."
Exodus,11,9,"Then the Lord said to Moses, Pharaoh will not listen to you, that My wonders and miracles may be multiplied in the land of Egypt."
Exodus,11,10,"Moses and Aaron did all these wonders and miracles before Pharaoh; and the Lord hardened Pharaoh's stubborn heart, and he did not let the Israelites go out of his land."
Exodus,12,1,"THE Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,"
Exodus,12,2,"This month shall be to you the beginning of months, the first month of the year to you."
Exodus,12,3,"Tell all the congregation of Israel, On the tenth day of this month they shall take every man a lamb or kid, according to [the size of] the family of which he is the father, a lamb or kid for each house."

Exodus,12,7,They shall take of the blood and put it on the two side posts and on the lintel [above the door space] of the houses in which they shall eat [the Passover lamb]. [Matt. 26:28; John 1:29; Heb. 9:14.]
Exodus,12,8,They shall eat the flesh that night roasted; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it.
Exodus,12,9,"Eat not of it raw nor boiled at all with water, but roastedâ€“its head, its legs, and its inner parts."
Exodus,12,10,You shall let nothing of the meat remain until the morning; and the bones and unedible bits which remain of it until morning you shall burn with fire.
Exodus,12,11,"And you shall eat it thus: [as fully prepared for a journey] your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste. It is the Lord's Passover."

Exodus,12,14,"And this day shall be to you for a memorial. You shall keep it as a feast to the Lord throughout your generations, keep it as an ordinance forever."
Exodus,12,15,"[In celebration of the Passover in future years] seven days shall you eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away leaven [symbolic of corruption] out of your houses; for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel."
Exodus,12,16,"On the first day you shall hold a solemn and holy assembly, and on the seventh day there shall be a solemn and holy assembly; no kind of work shall be done in them, save [preparation of] that which every person must eatâ€“that only may be done by you."

Exodus,12,40,"Now the time the Israelites dwelt in Egypt was 430 years. [Gen. 15:13, 14.]"
Exodus,12,41,"At the end of the 430 years, even that very day, all the hosts of the Lord went out of Egypt."

Exodus,12,48,"When a stranger sojourning with you wishes to keep the Passover to the Lord, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land. But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it."

Exodus,14,18,"The Egyptians shall know and realize that I am the Lord when I have gained honor and glory over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen."
Exodus,14,19,"And the Angel of God Who went before the host of Israel moved and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before them and stood behind them,"
Exodus,14,20,"Coming between the host of Egypt and the host of Israel. It was a cloud and darkness to the Egyptians, but it gave light by night to the Israelites; and the one host did not come near the other all night."
Exodus,14,21,"Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land; and the waters were divided."
Exodus,14,22,"And the Israelites went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left."
Exodus,14,23,"The Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen."
Exodus,14,24,"And in the morning watch the Lord through the pillar of fire and cloud looked down on the host of the Egyptians and discomfited [them],"
Exodus,14,25,"And bound (clogged, took off) their chariot wheels, making them drive heavily; and the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel, for the Lord fights for them against the Egyptians!"
Exodus,14,26,"Then the Lord said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and horsemen."
Exodus,14,27,"So Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength and normal flow when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled into it [being met by it]; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians and shook them off into the midst of the sea."
Exodus,14,28,"The waters returned and covered the chariots, the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that pursued them; not even one of them remained."
Exodus,14,29,"But the Israelites walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left."
Exodus,14,30,"Thus the Lord saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore."
Exodus,14,31,"And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did against the Egyptians, and the people [reverently] feared the Lord and trusted in (relied on, remained steadfast to) the Lord and to His servant Moses."
Exodus,15,1,"THEN MOSES and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord, saying, I will sing to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider or its chariot has He thrown into the sea."
Exodus,15,2,"The Lord is my Strength and my Song, and He has become my Salvation; this is my God, and I will praise Him, my father's God, and I will exalt Him."
Exodus,15,3,The Lord is a Man of War; the Lord is His name.
Exodus,15,4,Pharaoh's chariots and his host has He cast into the sea; his chosen captains also are sunk in the Red Sea.
Exodus,15,5,The floods cover them; they sank in the depths [clad in mail] like a stone.
Exodus,15,6,"Your right hand, O Lord, is glorious in power; Your right hand, O Lord, shatters the enemy."
Exodus,15,7,In the greatness of Your majesty You overthrow those rising against You. You send forth Your fury; it consumes them like stubble.
Exodus,15,8,"With the blast of Your nostrils the waters piled up, the floods stood fixed in a heap, the deeps congealed in the heart of the sea."
Exodus,15,9,"The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my desire shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them."
Exodus,15,10,"You [Lord] blew with Your wind, the sea covered them; [clad in mail] they sank as lead in the mighty waters."
Exodus,15,11,"Who is like You, O Lord, among the gods? Who is like You, glorious in holiness, awesome in splendor, doing wonders?"
Exodus,15,12,"You stretched out Your right hand, the earth's [sea] swallowed them."
Exodus,15,13,You in Your mercy and loving-kindness have led forth the people whom You have redeemed; You have guided them in Your strength to Your holy habitation.
Exodus,15,14,The peoples have heard of it; they tremble; pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.
Exodus,15,15,"Now the chiefs of Edom are dismayed; the mighty men of Moab [renowned for strength], trembling takes hold of them; all the inhabitants of Canaan have melted awayâ€“little by little."
Exodus,15,16,"Terror and dread fall upon them; because of the greatness of Your arm they are as still as a stoneâ€“till Your people pass by and over [into Canaan], O Lord, till the people pass by whom You have purchased."
Exodus,15,17,"You will bring them in [to the land] and plant them on Your own mountain, the place, O Lord, You have made for Your dwelling, the sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established."
Exodus,15,18,The Lord will reign forever and ever.
Exodus,15,19,"For the horses of Pharaoh went with his chariots and horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought back the waters of the sea upon them, but the Israelites walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea."
Exodus,15,20,"Then Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and dancing."
Exodus,15,21,"And Miriam responded to them, Sing to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously and is highly exalted; the horse and his rider He has thrown into the sea."
Exodus,15,22,Then Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea and they went into the Wilderness of Shur; they went three days [thirty-three miles] in the wilderness and found no water.
Exodus,15,23,"When they came to Marah, they could not drink its waters for they were bitter; therefore it was named Marah [bitterness]."
Exodus,15,24,"The people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?"
Exodus,15,25,"And he cried to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree which he cast into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There [the Lord] made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there He proved them,"
Exodus,15,26,"Saying, If you will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord your God and will do what is right in His sight, and will listen to and obey His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon you which I brought upon the Egyptians, for I am the Lord Who heals you."
Exodus,15,27,"And they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the waters."
Exodus,16,1,"THEY SET out from Elim, and all the congregation of Israel came to the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they left the land of Egypt."
Exodus,16,2,"And the whole congregation of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness,"
Exodus,16,3,"And said to them, Would that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots and ate bread to the full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger."
Exodus,16,4,"Then the Lord said to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from the heavens for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in My law or not."
Exodus,16,5,On the sixth day they shall prepare to bring in twice as much as they gather daily.
Exodus,16,6,"So Moses and Aaron said to all Israel, At evening you shall know that the Lord has brought you out from the land of Egypt,"
Exodus,16,7,"And in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord, for He hears your murmurings against the Lord. For what are we, that you murmur against us?"
Exodus,16,8,"And Moses said, [This will happen] when the Lord gives you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full, because the Lord has heard your grumblings which you murmur against Him; what are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord."
Exodus,16,9,"And Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of Israel, Come near before the Lord, for He has heard your murmurings."
Exodus,16,10,"And as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud!"
Exodus,16,11,"The Lord said to Moses,"
Exodus,16,12,"I have heard the murmurings of the Israelites; speak to them, saying, At twilight you shall eat meat, and between the two evenings you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God."
Exodus,16,13,In the evening quails came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay round about the camp.
Exodus,16,14,"And when the dew had gone, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a fine, round and flakelike thing, as fine as hoarfrost on the ground."
Exodus,16,15,"When the Israelites saw it, they said one to another, Manna [What is it?]. For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, This is the bread which the Lord has given you to eat. [John 6:31, 33.]"
Exodus,16,16,"This is what the Lord has commanded: Let every man gather of it as much as he will need, an omer for each person, according to the number of your persons; take it, every man for those in his tent."
Exodus,16,17,"The [people] did so, and gathered, some more, some less."
Exodus,16,18,"When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack; each gathered according to his need."
Exodus,16,19,"Moses said, Let none of it be left until morning."
Exodus,16,20,"But they did not listen to Moses; some of them left of it until morning, and it bred worms, became foul, and stank; and Moses was angry with them."
Exodus,16,21,"They gathered it every morning, each as much as he needed, for when the sun became hot it melted."
Exodus,16,22,"And on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each person; and all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses."
Exodus,16,23,"He said to them, The Lord has said, Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord; bake and boil what you will bake and boil today; and all that remains over put aside for you to keep until morning."
Exodus,16,24,"They laid it aside till morning, as Moses told them; and it did not become foul, neither was it wormy."
Exodus,16,25,"Moses said, Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to the Lord. Today you shall find none in the field."
Exodus,16,26,"Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there shall be none."
Exodus,16,27,"On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they found none."
Exodus,16,28,"The Lord said to Moses, How long do you [people] refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?"
Exodus,16,29,"See, the Lord has given you the Sabbath; therefore He gives you on the sixth day the bread for two days; let every man remain in his place; let no man leave his place on the seventh day."
Exodus,16,30,So the people rested on the seventh day.
Exodus,16,31,"The house of Israel called the bread manna; it was like coriander seed, white, and it tasted like wafers made with honey."
Exodus,16,32,"Moses said, This is what the Lord commands, Take an omer of it to be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness when I brought you out of the land of Egypt."
Exodus,16,33,"And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot and put an omer of manna in it, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept throughout your generations."
Exodus,16,34,"As the Lord commanded Moses, Aaron laid it up before the Testimony to be kept [in the ark]. [Heb. 9:4.]"
Exodus,16,35,"And the Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a habitable land; they ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan."
Exodus,16,36,(Now an omer is the tenth of an ephah.)
Exodus,17,1,"ALL THE congregation of the Israelites moved on from the Wilderness of Sin by stages, according to the commandment of the Lord, and encamped at Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink."
Exodus,17,2,"Therefore, the people contended with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why do you find fault with me? Why do you tempt the Lord and try His patience?"
Exodus,17,3,"But the people thirsted there for water, and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and livestock with thirst?"
Exodus,17,4,"So Moses cried to the Lord, What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me."
Exodus,17,5,"And the Lord said to Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with you some of the elders of Israel; and take in your hand the rod with which you smote the river [Nile], and go."
Exodus,17,6,"Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at [Mount] Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. [I Cor. 10:4.]"
Exodus,17,7,"He called the place Massah [proof] and Meribah [contention] because of the faultfinding of the Israelites and because they tempted and tried the patience of the Lord, saying, Is the Lord among us or not?"
Exodus,17,8,Then came Amalek [descendants of Esau] and fought with Israel at Rephidim.
Exodus,17,9,"And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand."
Exodus,17,10,"So Joshua did as Moses said and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the hilltop."
Exodus,17,11,"When Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed; and when he lowered his hand, Amalek prevailed."
Exodus,17,12,"But Moses' hands were heavy and grew weary. So [the other men] took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Then Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side and one on the other side; so his hands were steady until the going down of the sun."
Exodus,17,13,And Joshua mowed down and disabled Amalek and his people with the sword.
Exodus,17,14,"And the Lord said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in the book and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens. [I Sam. 15:2-8.]"
Exodus,17,15,"And Moses built an altar and called the name of it, The Lord is my Banner;"
Exodus,17,16,"And he said, Because [theirs] is a hand against the throne of the Lord, the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation."
Exodus,18,1,"NOW JETHRO [Reuel], the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people, and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt."
Exodus,18,2,"Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after Moses had sent her back [to her father],"
Exodus,18,3,"And her two sons, of whom the name of the one was Gershom [ expulsion, or a stranger there], for Moses said, I have been an alien in a strange land;"
Exodus,18,4,"And the name of the other was Eliezer [God is help], for the God of my father, said Moses, was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh."
Exodus,18,5,"And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with Moses' sons and his wife to the wilderness where he was encamped at the mount of God [Horeb, or Sinai]."
Exodus,18,6,"And he said [in a message] to Moses, I, your father-in-law Jethro, am come to you and your wife and her two sons with her."
Exodus,18,7,And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed in homage and kissed him; and each asked the other of his welfare and they came into the tent.
Exodus,18,8,Moses told his father-in-law all the Lord had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake and all the hardships that had come upon them by the way and how the Lord delivered them.
Exodus,18,9,Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness the Lord had done to Israel in that He had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus,18,10,"Jethro said, Blessed be the Lord, Who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh, Who has delivered the people [Israel] from under the hand of the Egyptians."
Exodus,18,11,"Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods. Yes, in the [very] thing in which they dealt proudly [He showed Himself infinitely superior to all their gods]."
Exodus,18,12,"And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices [to offer] to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God."
Exodus,18,13,"Next day Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from morning till evening."
Exodus,18,14,"When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, What is this that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning till evening?"
Exodus,18,15,"Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God."
Exodus,18,16,"When they have a dispute they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God and His laws."
Exodus,18,17,"Moses' father-in-law said to him, The thing that you are doing is not good."
Exodus,18,18,"You will surely wear out both yourself and this people with you, for the thing is too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it all by yourself."
Exodus,18,19,"Listen now to [me]; I will counsel you, and God will be with you. You shall represent the people before God, bringing their cases and causes to Him,"
Exodus,18,20,"Teaching them the decrees and laws, showing them the way they must walk and the work they must do."
Exodus,18,21,"Moreover, you shall choose able men from all the peopleâ€“God-fearing men of truth who hate unjust gainâ€“and place them over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, to be their rulers."
Exodus,18,22,"And let them judge the people at all times; every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you."
Exodus,18,23,"If you will do this, and God so commands you, you will be able to endure [the strain], and all these people also will go to their [tents] in peace."
Exodus,18,24,So Moses listened to and heeded the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
Exodus,18,25,"Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens."
Exodus,18,26,"And they judged the people at all times; the hard cases they brought to Moses, but every small matter they decided themselves."
Exodus,18,27,"Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land."
Exodus,19,1,"IN THE third month after the Israelites left the land of Egypt, the same day, they came into the Wilderness of Sinai."
Exodus,19,2,"When they had departed from Rephidim and had come to the Wilderness of Sinai, they encamped there before the mountain."
Exodus,19,3,"And Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him out of the mountain, Say this to the house of Jacob and tell the Israelites:"
Exodus,19,4,"You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to Myself."
Exodus,19,5,"Now therefore, if you will obey My voice in truth and keep My covenant, then you shall be My own peculiar possession and treasure from among and above all peoples; for all the earth is Mine."
Exodus,19,6,"And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests, a holy nation [consecrated, set apart to the worship of God]. These are the words you shall speak to the Israelites."
Exodus,19,7,So Moses called for the elders of the people and told them all these words which the Lord commanded him.
Exodus,19,8,"And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord has spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people to the Lord."
Exodus,19,9,"And the Lord said to Moses, Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you and believe you and remain steadfast forever. Then Moses told the words of the people to the Lord."
Exodus,19,10,"And the Lord said to Moses, Go and sanctify the people [set them apart for God] today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes"
Exodus,19,11,"And be ready by the third day, for the third day the Lord will come down upon Mount Sinai [in the cloud] in the sight of all the people."
Exodus,19,12,"And you shall set bounds for the people round about, saying, Take heed that you go not up into the mountain or touch the border of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death."
Exodus,19,13,"No hand shall touch it [or the offender], but he shall surely be stoned or shot [with arrows]; whether beast or man, he shall not live. When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain. [Num. 24:8.]"
Exodus,19,14,"So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified them [set them apart for God], and they washed their clothes."
Exodus,19,15,"And he said to the people, Be ready by the day after tomorrow; do not go near a woman."
Exodus,19,16,"The third morning there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled."
Exodus,19,17,"Then Moses brought the people from the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain."
Exodus,19,18,"Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, for the Lord descended upon it in fire; its smoke ascended like that of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly."
Exodus,19,19,"As the trumpet blast grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him with a voice. [Deut. 4:12.]"
Exodus,19,20,"The Lord came down upon Mount Sinai to the top of the mountain, and the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up."
Exodus,19,21,"The Lord said to Moses, Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the Lord to gaze and many of them perish."
Exodus,19,22,"And also let the priests, who come near to the Lord, sanctify (set apart) themselves [for God], lest the Lord break forth against them."
Exodus,19,23,"And Moses said to the Lord, The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for You Yourself charged us, saying, Set bounds about the mountain and sanctify it [set it apart for God]."
Exodus,19,24,"Then the Lord said to him, Go, get down and you shall come up, you and Aaron with you; but let not the priests and the people break through to come up to the Lord, lest He break forth against them."
Exodus,19,25,So Moses went down to the people and told them.
Exodus,20,1,THEN GOD spoke all these words:
Exodus,20,2,"I am the Lord your God, Who has brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
Exodus,20,3,You shall have no other gods before or besides Me.
Exodus,20,4,"You shall not make yourself any graven image [to worship it] or any likeness of anything that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth;"
Exodus,20,5,"You shall not bow down yourself to them or serve them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Me, [Isa. 42:8; 48:11.]"
Exodus,20,6,But showing mercy and steadfast love to a thousand generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments.
Exodus,20,7,"You shall not use or repeat the name of the Lord your God in vain [that is, lightly or frivolously, in false affirmations or profanely]; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain."
Exodus,20,8,"[Earnestly] remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy (withdrawn from common employment and dedicated to God)."
Exodus,20,9,"Six days you shall labor and do all your work,"
Exodus,20,10,"But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, your daughter, your manservant, your maidservant, your domestic animals, or the sojourner within your gates."
Exodus,20,11,"For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. That is why the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it [set it apart for His purposes]."
Exodus,20,12,"Regard (treat with honor, due obedience, and courtesy) your father and mother, that your days may be long in the land the Lord your God gives you."
Exodus,20,13,You shall not commit murder.
Exodus,20,14,"You shall not commit adultery. [Prov. 6:25, 26; Matt. 5:28; Rom. 1:24; Eph. 5:3.]"
Exodus,20,15,You shall not steal. [Prov. 11:1; 16:8; 21:6; 22:16; Jer. 17:11; Mal. 3:8.]
Exodus,20,16,You shall not witness falsely against your neighbor. [Exod. 23:1; Prov. 19:9; 24:28.]
Exodus,20,17,"You shall not covet your neighbor's house, your neighbor's wife, or his manservant, or his maidservant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's. [Luke 12:15; Col. 3:5.]"
Exodus,20,18,"Now all the people perceived the thunderings and the lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the smoking mountain, and as [they] looked they trembled with fear and fell back and stood afar off."
Exodus,20,19,"And they said to Moses, You speak to us and we will listen, but let not God speak to us, lest we die."
Exodus,20,20,"And Moses said to the people, Fear not; for God has come to prove you, so that the [reverential] fear of Him may be before you, that you may not sin."
Exodus,20,21,"And the people stood afar off, but Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was."
Exodus,20,22,"And the Lord said to Moses, Thus shall you say to the Israelites, You have seen for yourselves that I have talked with you from heaven."
Exodus,20,23,You shall not make [gods to share] with Me [My glory and your worship]; gods of silver or gods of gold you shall not make for yourselves.
Exodus,20,24,"An altar of earth you shall make to Me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I record My name and cause it to be remembered I will come to you and bless you."
Exodus,20,25,"And if you will make Me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone, for if you lift up a tool upon it you have polluted it."
Exodus,20,26,"Neither shall you go up by steps to My altar, that your nakedness be not exposed upon it."
Exodus,21,1,NOW THESE are the ordinances you [Moses] shall set before [the Israelites].
Exodus,21,2,"If you buy a Hebrew servant [as the result of debt or theft], he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free, paying nothing. [Lev. 25:39.]"
Exodus,21,3,"If he came [to you] by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he came married, then his wife shall go out with him."
Exodus,21,4,"If his master has given him a wife and she has borne him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out [of your service] alone."
Exodus,21,5,"But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go free,"
Exodus,21,6,Then his master shall bring him to God [the judges as His agents]; he shall bring him to the door or doorpost and shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him for life.
Exodus,21,7,"If a man sells his daughter to be a maidservant or bondwoman, she shall not go out [in six years] as menservants do."
Exodus,21,8,"If she does not please her master who has not espoused her to himself, he shall let her be redeemed. To sell her to a foreign people he shall have no power, for he has dealt faithlessly with her."
Exodus,21,9,"And if he espouses her to his son, he shall deal with her as with a daughter."
Exodus,21,10,"If he marries again, her food, clothing, and privilege as a wife shall he not diminish."
Exodus,21,11,"And if he does not do these three things for her, then shall she go out free, without payment of money."
Exodus,21,12,Whoever strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death.
Exodus,21,13,"But if he did not lie in wait for him, but God allowed him to fall into his hand, then I will appoint you a place to which he may flee [for protection until duly tried]. [Num. 35:22-28.]"
Exodus,21,14,"But if a man comes willfully upon another to slay him craftily, you shall take him from My altar [to which he may have fled for protection], that he may die."
Exodus,21,15,Whoever strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
Exodus,21,16,"Whoever kidnaps a man, whether he sells him or is found with him in his possession, shall surely be put to death."
Exodus,21,17,Whoever curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
Exodus,21,18,"If men quarrel and one strikes another with a stone or with his fist and he does not die but keeps his bed,"
Exodus,21,19,"If he rises again and walks about leaning upon his staff, then he that struck him shall be clear, except he must pay for the loss of his time and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed."

Exodus,32,2,"So Aaron replied, Take the gold rings from the ears of your wives, your sons, and daughters, and bring them to me."
Exodus,32,3,So all the people took the gold rings from their ears and brought them to Aaron.
Exodus,32,4,"And he received the gold at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it a molten calf; and they said, These are your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt!"
Exodus,32,5,"And when Aaron saw the molten calf, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord."
Exodus,32,6,And they rose up early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.
Exodus,32,7,"The Lord said to Moses, Go down, for your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves;"
Exodus,32,8,"They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten calf and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it, and said, These are your gods, O Israel, that brought you up out of the land of Egypt!"
Exodus,32,9,"And the Lord said to Moses, I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people;"
Exodus,32,10,"Now therefore let Me alone, that My wrath may burn hot against them and that I may destroy them; but I will make of you a great nation."
Exodus,32,11,"But Moses besought the Lord his God, and said, Lord, why does Your wrath blaze hot against Your people, whom You have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?"
Exodus,32,12,"Why should the Egyptians say, For evil He brought them forth, to slay them in the mountains and consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from Your fierce wrath, and change Your mind concerning this evil against Your people."
Exodus,32,13,"[Earnestly] remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your own self and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit it forever."
Exodus,32,14,Then the Lord turned from the evil which He had thought to do to His people.
Exodus,32,15,"And Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tables of the Testimony in his hand, tables or tablets that were written on both sides."
Exodus,32,16,"The tables were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables."
Exodus,32,17,"And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp."
Exodus,32,18,"But Moses said, It is not the sound of shouting for victory, neither is it the sound of the cry of the defeated, but the sound of singing that I hear."
Exodus,32,19,And as soon as he came near to the camp he saw the calf and the dancing. And Moses' anger blazed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain.
Exodus,32,20,"And he took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire, and ground it to powder and scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it."
Exodus,32,21,"And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people do to you, that you have brought so great a sin upon them?"
Exodus,32,22,"And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord blaze hot; you know the people, that they are set on evil."
Exodus,32,23,"For they said to me, Make us gods which shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him."
Exodus,32,24,"I said to them, Those who have any gold, let them take it off. So they gave it to me; then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf."
Exodus,32,25,"And when Moses saw that the people were unruly and unrestrained (for Aaron had let them get out of control, so that they were a derision and object of shame among their enemies),"
Exodus,32,26,"Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoever is on the Lord's side, let him come to me. And all the Levites [the priestly tribe] gathered together to him."
Exodus,32,27,"And he said to them, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, Every man put his sword on his side and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor."
Exodus,32,28,And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about 3000 men.
Exodus,32,29,"And Moses said [to the Levites, By your obedience to God's command] you have consecrated yourselves today [as priests] to the Lord, each man [at the cost of being] against his own son and his own brother, that the Lord may restore and bestow His blessing upon you this day."
Exodus,32,30,"The next day Moses said to the people, You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to the Lord; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."
Exodus,32,31,"So Moses returned to the Lord, and said, Oh, these people have sinned a great sin and have made themselves gods of gold!"
Exodus,32,32,"Yet now, if You will forgive their sinâ€“and if not, blot me, I pray You, out of Your book which You have written!"
Exodus,32,33,"But the Lord said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him [not you] out of My book. [Dan. 12:1; Phil. 4:3; Rev. 3:5.]"
Exodus,32,34,"But now go, lead the people to the place of which I have told you. Behold, My Angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I punish I will visit their sin upon them! [Exod. 23:20; 33:2, 3.]"
Exodus,32,35,And the Lord sent a plague upon the people because they made the calf which Aaron fashioned for them.
Exodus,33,1,"THE Lord said to Moses, Depart, go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought from the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, To your descendants I will give it."
Exodus,33,2,"I will send an Angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanite, Amorite, Hittite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite. [Exod. 23:23; 34:11.]"
Exodus,33,3,"Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up among you, for you are a stiff-necked people, lest I destroy you on the way."
Exodus,33,4,"When the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned and no man put on his ornaments."
Exodus,33,5,"For the Lord had said to Moses, Say to the Israelites, You are a stiff-necked people! If I should come among you for one moment, I would consume and destroy you. Now therefore [penitently] leave off your ornaments, that I may know what to do with you."
Exodus,33,6,"And the Israelites left off all their ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward."
Exodus,33,7,"Now Moses used to take [his own] tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting [of God with His own people]. And everyone who sought the Lord went out to [that temporary] tent of meeting which was outside the camp."
Exodus,33,8,"When Moses went out to the tent of meeting, all the people rose and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses until he had gone into the tent."
Exodus,33,9,"When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the door of the tent, and the Lord would talk with Moses."
Exodus,33,10,"And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the tent door, and all the people rose up and worshiped, every man at his tent door."

Exodus,36,5,"And they said to Moses, The people bring much more than enough for doing the work which the Lord commanded to do."
Exodus,36,6,"So Moses commanded and it was proclaimed in all the camp, Let no man or woman do anything more for the sanctuary offering. So the people were restrained from bringing,"
Exodus,36,7,For the stuff they had was sufficient to do all the work and more.
Exodus,36,8,"And all the able and wisehearted men among them who did the work on the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen and blue, purple, and scarlet [stuff], with cherubim skillfully worked on them."
Exodus,36,9,The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits and its breadth four cubits; all the curtains were one size.
Exodus,36,10,[Bezalel] coupled five curtains one to another and the other five curtains he coupled one to another.

Exodus,36,21,The length of a board was ten cubits and the breadth one cubit and a half.
Exodus,36,22,Each board had two tenons (projections) to fit into a mortise to form a clutch; he did this for all the boards of the tabernacle.
Exodus,36,23,"And he made thus the boards [for frames] for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side,"
Exodus,36,24,"And he made under the twenty boards forty sockets or bases of silver, two sockets under one board for its two tenons or hands, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons."

Exodus,36,28,And two boards he made for each corner of the tabernacle in the rear.
