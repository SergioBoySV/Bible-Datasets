1 Chronicles,21,16,"David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the Lord standing between earth and the heavens, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces."
1 Chronicles,21,17,"And David said to God, Is it not I who commanded the people to be numbered? It is I who has sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray You, O Lord my God, be on me and on my father's house, but not on Your people, that they should be plagued."
1 Chronicles,21,18,Then the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and set up an altar to the Lord in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

1 Chronicles,21,22,"Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the site of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar on it to the Lord. You shall charge me the full price for it, that the plague may be averted from the people."
1 Chronicles,21,23,"Ornan said to David, Take it; and let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes. I give you the oxen also for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for wood and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all."
1 Chronicles,21,24,"And King David said to Ornan, No, but I will pay the full price. I will not take what is yours for the Lord, nor offer burnt offerings which cost me nothing."
1 Chronicles,21,25,So David gave to Ornan for the site 600 shekels of gold by weight.
1 Chronicles,21,26,And David built there an altar to the Lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and called upon the Lord; and He answered him by fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering.

1 Chronicles,22,9,"Behold, a son shall be born to you who shall be a man of peace. I will give him rest from all his enemies round about; for his name shall be Solomon [peaceable], and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days. [II Sam. 12:24, 25.]"
1 Chronicles,22,10,"He shall build a house for My Name and [the symbol of My] Presence. He shall be My son, and I will be his father; and I will establish his royal throne over Israel forever."
1 Chronicles,22,11,"Now, my son, the Lord be with and prosper you in building the house of the Lord your God, as He has spoken concerning you."
1 Chronicles,22,12,"Only may the Lord give you wisdom and understanding as you are put in charge of Israel, that you may keep the law of the Lord your God."
1 Chronicles,22,13,Then you will prosper if you are careful to keep and fulfill the statutes and ordinances with which the Lord charged Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and of good courage. Dread not and fear not; be not dismayed.
1 Chronicles,22,14,"In my affliction and trouble I have provided for the house of the Lord 100,000 talents of gold, 1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron without weighing. I have also provided timber and stone; you must add to them."
1 Chronicles,22,15,"You have workmen in abundance: hewers, workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of craftsmen without number, skillful in doing every kind of work"
1 Chronicles,22,16,"With gold, silver, bronze, and iron. So arise and be doing, and the Lord be with you!"
1 Chronicles,22,17,"David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,"
1 Chronicles,22,18,"Is not the Lord your God with you? And has He not given you peace on every side? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land is subdued before the Lord and His people."
1 Chronicles,22,19,"Now set your mind and heart to seek (inquire of and require as your vital necessity) the Lord your God.

1 Chronicles,24,3,"And David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided and distributed them according to their assigned duties."
1 Chronicles,24,4,"Since there were more chief men found among the sons of Eleazar [because of the misfortunes of Eli, and Saul's slaughter of the priests at Nob] than among the sons of Ithamar, they were divided thus: sixteen heads of fathers' houses of the sons of Eleazar and eight of the sons of Ithamar according to their fathers' houses."
