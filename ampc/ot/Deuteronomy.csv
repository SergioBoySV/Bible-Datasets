Deuteronomy,1,1,"THESE ARE the words which Moses spoke to all Israel [still] on the [east] side of the Jordan [River] in the wilderness, in the Arabah [the deep valley running north and south from the eastern arm of the Red Sea to beyond the Dead Sea], over near Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab."
Deuteronomy,1,2,It is [only] eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea [on Canaan's border; yet Israel took forty years to get beyond it].
Deuteronomy,1,3,"And in the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the Israelites according to all that the Lord had given him in commandment to them,"
Deuteronomy,1,4,"After He had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth [and] Edrei."
Deuteronomy,1,5,"Beyond (east of) the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying,"
Deuteronomy,1,6,"The Lord our God said to us in Horeb, You have dwelt long enough on this mountain."
Deuteronomy,1,7,"Turn and take up your journey and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the lowland, in the South (the Negeb), and on the coast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates."
Deuteronomy,1,8,"Behold, I have set the land before you; go in and take possession of the land which the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their descendants after them."
Deuteronomy,1,9,"I said to you at that time, I am not able to bear you alone."
Deuteronomy,1,10,"The Lord your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this day as the stars of the heavens for multitude."
Deuteronomy,1,11,"May the Lord, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are and bless you as He has promised you!"
Deuteronomy,1,12,How can I bear alone the weariness and pressure and burden of you and your strife?
Deuteronomy,1,13,"Choose wise, understanding, experienced, and respected men according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you."
Deuteronomy,1,14,"And you answered me, The thing which you have spoken is good for us to do."
Deuteronomy,1,15,"So I took the heads of your tribes, wise, experienced, and respected men, and made them heads over you, commanders of thousands, and hundreds, and fifties, and tens, and officers according to your tribes."
Deuteronomy,1,16,And I charged your judges at that time: Hear the cases between your brethren and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the stranger or sojourner who is with him.
Deuteronomy,1,17,"You shall not be partial in judgment; but you shall hear the small as well as the great. You shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God's. And the case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it."
Deuteronomy,1,18,And I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.
Deuteronomy,1,19,"And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us, and we came to Kadesh-barnea."
Deuteronomy,1,20,"And I said to you, You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God gives us."
Deuteronomy,1,21,"Behold, the Lord your God has set the land before you; go up and possess it, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has said to you. Fear not, neither be dismayed."
Deuteronomy,1,22,"Then you all came near to me and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search out the land for us and bring us word again by what way we should go up and the cities into which we shall come."
Deuteronomy,1,23,"The thing pleased me well, and I took twelve men of you, one for each tribe."
Deuteronomy,1,24,"And they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied it out."
Deuteronomy,1,25,"And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the Lord our God gives us."
Deuteronomy,1,26,"Yet you would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,1,27,"You were peevish and discontented in your tents, and said, Because the Lord hated us, He brought us forth out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us."
Deuteronomy,1,28,"To what are we going up? Our brethren have made our hearts melt, saying, The people are bigger and taller than we are; the cities are great and fortified to the heavens. And moreover we have seen the [giantlike] sons of the Anakim there."
Deuteronomy,1,29,"Then I said to you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them."
Deuteronomy,1,30,"The Lord your God Who goes before you, He will fight for you just as He did for you in Egypt before your eyes,"
Deuteronomy,1,31,"And in the wilderness, where you have seen how the Lord your God bore you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went until you came to this place."
Deuteronomy,1,32,"Yet in spite of this word you did not believe (trust, rely on, and remain steadfast to) the Lord your God,"
Deuteronomy,1,33,"Who went in the way before you to search out a place to pitch your tents, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day."
Deuteronomy,1,34,"And the Lord heard your words, and was angered and He swore,"
Deuteronomy,1,35,"Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see that good land which I swore to give to your fathers,"
Deuteronomy,1,36,"Except [Joshua, of course, and] Caleb son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and to his children I will give the land upon which he has walked, because he has wholly followed the Lord."
Deuteronomy,1,37,"The Lord was angry with me also for your sakes, and said, You also shall not enter Canaan."
Deuteronomy,1,38,"But Joshua son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it."
Deuteronomy,1,39,"Moreover, your little ones whom you said would become a prey, and your children who at this time cannot discern between good and evil, they shall enter Canaan, and to them I will give it and they shall possess it."
Deuteronomy,1,40,"But as for you, turn and journey into the wilderness by way of the Red Sea."
Deuteronomy,1,41,"Then you said to me, We have sinned against the Lord. We will go up and fight, as the Lord our God commanded us. And you girded on every man his battle weapons, and thought it a simple matter to go up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"And the Lord said to me, Say to them, Do not go up or fight, for I am not among you–lest you be dangerously hurt by your enemies."
Deuteronomy,1,43,"So I spoke to you, and you would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord, and were presumptuous and went up into the hill country."
Deuteronomy,1,44,Then the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do and struck you down in Seir as far as Hormah.
Deuteronomy,1,45,"And you returned and wept before the Lord, but the Lord would not heed your voice or listen to you."
Deuteronomy,1,46,So you remained in Kadesh; many days you remained there.
Deuteronomy,2,1,"THEN WE turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, as the Lord directed me; and for many days we journeyed around Mount Seir."
Deuteronomy,2,2,"And the Lord spoke to me [Moses], saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,3,You have roamed around this mountain country long enough; turn northward.
Deuteronomy,2,4,"And command the Israelites, You are to pass through the territory of your kinsmen the sons of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So watch yourselves carefully."
Deuteronomy,2,5,"Do not provoke or stir them up, for I will not give you of their land, no, not enough for the sole of your foot to tread on, for I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession."
Deuteronomy,2,6,"You shall buy food from them for money, that you may eat, and you shall also buy water from them for money, that you may drink."
Deuteronomy,2,7,For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand. He knows your walking through this great wilderness. These forty years the Lord your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.
Deuteronomy,2,8,"So we passed on from our brethren the sons of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, away from the Arabah (wilderness), and from Elath and from Ezion-geber. We turned and went by the way of the wilderness of Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,9,"And the Lord said to me, Do not trouble or assault Moab or contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot for a possession."
Deuteronomy,2,10,"(The Emim dwelt there in times past, a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim."
Deuteronomy,2,11,"These also are known as Rephaim [of giant stature], as are the Anakim, but the Moabites call them Emim."
Deuteronomy,2,12,"The Horites also formerly lived in Seir, but the sons of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and dwelt in their stead, as Israel did to the land of their possession which the Lord gave to them.)"
Deuteronomy,2,13,Now rise up and go over the brook Zered. So we went over the brook Zered.
Deuteronomy,2,14,"And the time from our leaving Kadesh-barnea until we had come over the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until the whole generation of the men of war had perished from the camp, as the Lord had sworn to them."
Deuteronomy,2,15,"Moreover the hand of the Lord was against them to exterminate them from the midst of the camp, until they were all gone."
Deuteronomy,2,16,"So when all the men of war had died from among the people,"
Deuteronomy,2,17,"The Lord spoke to me [Moses], saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,18,"You are this day to pass through Ar, the border of Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,19,"But when you come near the territory of the sons of Ammon, do not trouble or assault them or provoke or stir them up, for I will not give you any of the land of the Ammonites for a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession."
Deuteronomy,2,20,"(That also is known as a land of Rephaim [of giant stature]; Rephaim dwelt there formerly, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,"
Deuteronomy,2,21,"A people great and many, and tall as the Anakim. But the Lord destroyed them before [Ammon], and they dispossessed them and settled in their stead,"
Deuteronomy,2,22,"As He did for the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them, and they dispossessed them and settled in their stead even to this day."
Deuteronomy,2,23,"As for the Avvim who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim who came from Caphtor destroyed them and dwelt in their stead.)"
Deuteronomy,2,24,"Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the Valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it and contend with him in battle."
Deuteronomy,2,25,"This day will I begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples who are under the whole heavens, who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you."
Deuteronomy,2,26,"So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,"
Deuteronomy,2,27,"Let me pass through your land. I will go only by the road, turning aside neither to the right nor to the left."
Deuteronomy,2,28,"You shall sell me food to eat and sell me water to drink; only let me walk through,"
Deuteronomy,2,29,"As the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites, who dwell in Ar, did for me, until I go over the Jordan into the land which the Lord our God gives us."
Deuteronomy,2,30,"But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for the Lord your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that He might give him into your hand, as at this day."
Deuteronomy,2,31,"And the Lord said to me [Moses], Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to take possession, that you may succeed him and occupy his land."
Deuteronomy,2,32,"Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz."
Deuteronomy,2,33,"And the Lord our God gave him over to us, and we defeated him and his sons and all his people."
Deuteronomy,2,34,"At the same time we took all his cities and utterly destroyed every city–men, women, and children. We left none to remain."
Deuteronomy,2,35,Only the cattle we took as booty for ourselves and the spoil of the cities which we had captured.
Deuteronomy,2,36,"From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Arnon Valley, and from the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was no city too high and strong for us; the Lord our God delivered all to us."
Deuteronomy,2,37,"Only you did not go near the land of the Ammonites, that is, to any bank of the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, and wherever the Lord our God had forbidden us."
Deuteronomy,3,1,"THEN WE turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei."
Deuteronomy,3,2,"And the Lord said to me, Do not fear him, for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon."
Deuteronomy,3,3,"So the Lord our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his people, and we smote him until not one was left to him."
Deuteronomy,3,4,"And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them, sixty cities, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,5,"All these cities were fortified with high and haughty walls, gates, and bars, besides a great many unwalled villages."
Deuteronomy,3,6,"And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every city–men, women, and children."
Deuteronomy,3,7,But all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for booty for ourselves.
Deuteronomy,3,8,"So we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon"
Deuteronomy,3,9,"(The Sidonians call Hermon, Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir),"
Deuteronomy,3,10,"All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,11,"For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the [gigantic] Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the Ammonites? Nine cubits was its length and four cubits its breadth, using the cubit of a man [the forearm to the end of the middle finger]."
Deuteronomy,3,12,"When we took possession of this land, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead and its cities."
Deuteronomy,3,13,"The rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, that is, all the region of Argob in Bashan, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. It is called the land of Rephaim [of giant stature]."
Deuteronomy,3,14,"Jair son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called it after his own name, Havvoth-jair, so called to this day."
Deuteronomy,3,15,And I gave Gilead to Machir [son of Manasseh].
Deuteronomy,3,16,"And to the Reubenites and Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the Valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as the boundary of it, as far over as the river Jabbok, the boundary of the Ammonites,"
Deuteronomy,3,17,"The Arabah also, with the Jordan as its boundary, from Chinnereth as far as the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt [Dead] Sea, under the cliffs [of the headlands] of Pisgah on the east."
Deuteronomy,3,18,"And I commanded you at that time, saying, The Lord your God has given you this land to possess it; you [Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh] shall go over [the Jordan] armed before your brethren the other Israelites, all that are able for war."
Deuteronomy,3,19,"But your wives and your little ones and your cattle–I know that you have many cattle–shall remain in your cities which I have given you,"
Deuteronomy,3,20,"Until the Lord has given rest to your brethren as to you, and until they also possess the land which the Lord your God has given them beyond the Jordan. Then shall you return every man to the possession which I have given you."
Deuteronomy,3,21,"And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your own eyes have seen all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings [Sihon and Og]; so shall the Lord do to all the kingdoms into which you are going over [the Jordan]."
Deuteronomy,3,22,"You shall not fear them, for the Lord your God shall fight for you."
Deuteronomy,3,23,"And I besought the Lord at that time, saying,"
Deuteronomy,3,24,"O Lord God, You have only begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your mighty hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth that can do according to Your works and according to Your might?"
Deuteronomy,3,25,"I pray You, [will You not just] let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain country [with Hermon] and Lebanon?"
Deuteronomy,3,26,"But the Lord was angry with me on your account and would not listen to me; and the Lord said to me, That is enough! Say no more to Me about it."
Deuteronomy,3,27,"Get up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward, and behold it with your eyes, for you shall not go over this Jordan."
Deuteronomy,3,28,"But charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he shall go over before this people and he shall cause them to possess the land which you shall see."
Deuteronomy,3,29,So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
Deuteronomy,4,1,"NOW LISTEN and give heed, O Israel, to the statutes and ordinances which I teach you, and do them, that you may live and go in and possess the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, gives you."
Deuteronomy,4,2,"You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you."
Deuteronomy,4,3,"Your eyes still see what the Lord did because of Baal-peor; for all the men who followed the Baal of Peor the Lord your God has destroyed from among you, [Num. 25:1-9.]"
Deuteronomy,4,4,"But you who clung fast to the Lord your God are alive, every one of you, this day."
Deuteronomy,4,5,"Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances as the Lord my God commanded me, that you should do them in the land which you are entering to possess."
Deuteronomy,4,6,"So keep them and do them, for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who, when they hear all these statutes, will say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people."
Deuteronomy,4,7,For what great nation is there who has a god so near to them as the Lord our God is to us in all things for which we call upon Him?
Deuteronomy,4,8,And what large and important nation has statutes and ordinances so upright and just as all this law which I set before you today?
Deuteronomy,4,9,"Only take heed, and guard your life diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes have seen and lest they depart from your [mind and] heart all the days of your life. Teach them to your children and your children's children–"
Deuteronomy,4,10,"Especially how on the day that you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb, the Lord said to me, Gather the people together to Me and I will make them hear My words, that they may learn [reverently] to fear Me all the days they live upon the earth and that they may teach their children."
Deuteronomy,4,11,"And you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick gloom."
Deuteronomy,4,12,"And the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the voice of the words, but saw no form; there was only a voice."
Deuteronomy,4,13,"And He declared to you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, the Ten Commandments, and He wrote them on two tables of stone."
Deuteronomy,4,14,"And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you the statutes and precepts, that you might do them in the land which you are going over to possess."
Deuteronomy,4,15,"Therefore take good heed to yourselves, since you saw no form of Him on the day the Lord spoke to you on Horeb out of the midst of the fire,"
Deuteronomy,4,16,"Beware lest you become corrupt by making for yourselves [to worship] a graven image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,"
Deuteronomy,4,17,"The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, or of any winged fowl that flies in the air,"
Deuteronomy,4,18,"The likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, or of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth."
Deuteronomy,4,19,"And beware lest you lift up your eyes to the heavens, and when you see the sun, moon, and stars, even all the host of the heavens, you be drawn away and worship them and serve them, things which the Lord your God has allotted to all nations under the whole heaven."
Deuteronomy,4,20,"But the Lord has taken you and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to Him a people of His own possession, as you are this day."
Deuteronomy,4,21,"Furthermore the Lord was angry with me because of you, and He swore that I should not go over the Jordan and that I should not enter the good land which the Lord your God gives you for an inheritance."
Deuteronomy,4,22,But I must die in this land; I must not cross the Jordan; but you shall go over and possess that good land.
Deuteronomy,4,23,"Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the Lord your God which He made with you, and make for yourselves a graven image in the form of anything which the Lord your God has forbidden you."
Deuteronomy,4,24,"For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God."
Deuteronomy,4,25,"When children shall be born to you, and children's children, and you have grown old in the land, if you corrupt yourselves by making a graven image in the form of anything, and do evil in the sight of the Lord your God, provoking Him to anger,"
Deuteronomy,4,26,I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that you shall soon utterly perish from the land which you are going over the Jordan to possess. You will not live long upon it but will be utterly destroyed.
Deuteronomy,4,27,"And the Lord will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations to which the Lord will drive you."
Deuteronomy,4,28,"There you will serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell."
Deuteronomy,4,29,"But if from there you will seek (inquire for and require as necessity) the Lord your God, you will find Him if you [truly] seek Him with all your heart [and mind] and soul and life."
Deuteronomy,4,30,"When you are in tribulation and all these things come upon you, in the latter days you will turn to the Lord your God and be obedient to His voice."
Deuteronomy,4,31,"For the Lord your God is a merciful God; He will not fail you or destroy you or forget the covenant of your fathers, which He swore to them."
Deuteronomy,4,32,"For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from one end of the heavens to the other, whether such a great thing as this has ever occurred or been heard of anywhere."
Deuteronomy,4,33,"Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you heard, and live?"
Deuteronomy,4,34,"Or has God ever tried to go and take for Himself a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?"
Deuteronomy,4,35,"To you it was shown, that you might realize and have personal knowledge that the Lord is God; there is no other besides Him."
Deuteronomy,4,36,"Out of heaven He made you hear His voice, that He might correct, discipline, and admonish you; and on earth He made you see His great fire, and you heard His words out of the midst of the fire."
Deuteronomy,4,37,"And because He loved your fathers, He chose their descendants after them, and brought you out from Egypt with His own Presence, by His mighty power,"
Deuteronomy,4,38,"Driving out nations from before you, greater and mightier than yourselves, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is this day;"
Deuteronomy,4,39,"Know, recognize, and understand therefore this day and turn your [mind and] heart to it that the Lord is God in the heavens above and upon the earth beneath; there is no other."
Deuteronomy,4,40,"Therefore you shall keep His statutes and His commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may prolong your days in the land which the Lord your God gives you forever."
Deuteronomy,4,41,"Then Moses set apart three cities [of refuge] beyond the Jordan to the east,"
Deuteronomy,4,42,"That the manslayer might flee there, who slew his neighbor unintentionally and had not previously been at enmity with him, that fleeing to one of these cities he might save his life:"
Deuteronomy,4,43,"Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites."
Deuteronomy,4,44,This is the law which Moses set before the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,4,45,"These are the testimonies and the laws and the precepts which Moses spoke to the Israelites when they came out of Egypt,"
Deuteronomy,4,46,"Beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the Israelites smote when they came out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,4,47,"And they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who lived beyond the Jordan to the east,"
Deuteronomy,4,48,"From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, as far as Mount Sirion (that is, Hermon),"
Deuteronomy,4,49,"And all the Arabah (lowlands) beyond the Jordan eastward, as far as the Sea of the Arabah [the Dead Sea], under the slopes and springs of Pisgah."
Deuteronomy,5,1,"AND MOSES called all Israel, and said to them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and ordinances which I speak in your hearing this day, that you may learn them and take heed and do them."
Deuteronomy,5,2,The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
Deuteronomy,5,3,"The Lord made this covenant not with our fathers, but with us, who are all of us here alive this day."
Deuteronomy,5,4,The Lord spoke with you face to face at the mount out of the midst of the fire.
Deuteronomy,5,5,"I stood between the Lord and you at that time to show you the word of the Lord, for you were afraid because of the fire and went not up into the mount. He said,"
Deuteronomy,5,6,"I am the Lord your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage."
Deuteronomy,5,7,You shall have no other gods before Me or besides Me.
Deuteronomy,5,8,You shall not make for yourself [to worship] a graven image or any likeness of anything that is in the heavens above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth.
Deuteronomy,5,9,"You shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,"
Deuteronomy,5,10,And showing mercy and steadfast love to thousands and to a thousand generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments.
Deuteronomy,5,11,"You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in falsehood or without purpose."
Deuteronomy,5,12,"Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy, as the Lord your God commanded you."
Deuteronomy,5,13,"Six days you shall labor and do all your work,"
Deuteronomy,5,14,"But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, or your manservant or your maidservant, or your ox or your donkey or any of your livestock, or the stranger or sojourner who is within your gates, that your manservant and your maidservant may rest as well as you."
Deuteronomy,5,15,And [earnestly] remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm; therefore the Lord your God commanded you to observe and take heed to the Sabbath day.
Deuteronomy,5,16,"Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God commanded you, that your days may be prolonged and that it may go well with you in the land which the Lord your God gives you."
Deuteronomy,5,17,You shall not murder.
Deuteronomy,5,18,Neither shall you commit adultery.
Deuteronomy,5,19,Neither shall you act slyly or steal.
Deuteronomy,5,20,Neither shall you witness falsely against your neighbor.
Deuteronomy,5,21,"Neither shall you covet your neighbor's wife, nor desire your neighbor's house, his field, his manservant or his maidservant, his ox or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's."
Deuteronomy,5,22,"These words the Lord spoke to all your assembly at the mountain out of the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice; and He spoke not again [added no more]. He wrote them on two tables of stone and gave them to me [Moses]."
Deuteronomy,5,23,"And when you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders;"
Deuteronomy,5,24,"And you said, Behold, the Lord our God has shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice out of the midst of the fire; we have this day seen that God speaks with man and man still lives."
Deuteronomy,5,25,"Now therefore, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer, we shall die."
Deuteronomy,5,26,"For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of fire, as we have, and lived?"

Deuteronomy,9,9,"When I went up the mountain to receive the tables of stone, the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with you, I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I neither ate food nor drank water."
Deuteronomy,9,10,And the Lord delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them were all the words which the Lord spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
Deuteronomy,9,11,"And at the end of forty days and forty nights the Lord gave me the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant."
Deuteronomy,9,12,"And the Lord said to me, Arise, go down from here quickly, for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made for themselves a molten image."
Deuteronomy,9,13,"Furthermore the Lord said to me, I have seen this people, and behold, they are stubborn and hard."
Deuteronomy,9,14,"Let me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under the heavens; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they."
Deuteronomy,9,15,"So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. And the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands."
Deuteronomy,9,16,"And I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the Lord your God; you had made for yourselves a molten calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way which the Lord had commanded you."
Deuteronomy,9,17,"I took the two tables, cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes."
Deuteronomy,9,18,"Then I fell down before the Lord as before, for forty days and forty nights; I neither ate food nor drank water, because of all the sin you had committed in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger."

Deuteronomy,9,22,At Taberah also and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked the Lord to wrath.
Deuteronomy,9,23,"Likewise when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you, then you rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God, and you did not believe Him or trust and rely on Him or obey His voice."
Deuteronomy,9,24,You have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you.
Deuteronomy,9,25,So I fell down and lay prostrate before the Lord forty days and nights because the Lord had said He would destroy you.
Deuteronomy,9,26,"And I prayed to the Lord, O Lord God, do not destroy Your people and Your heritage, whom You have redeemed through Your greatness, whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand."
Deuteronomy,9,27,"Remember [earnestly] Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not at the stubbornness of this people or at their wickedness or at their sin,"
Deuteronomy,9,28,"Lest the land from which You brought us out say, Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which He promised them, and because He hated them, He has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness."
Deuteronomy,9,29,"Yet they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You brought out by Your mighty power and by Your outstretched arm."
Deuteronomy,10,1,"AT THAT time the Lord said to me, Hew two tables of stone like the first and come up to Me on the mountain and make an ark of wood."
Deuteronomy,10,2,"And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark."
Deuteronomy,10,3,"So I [Moses] made an ark of acacia wood and hewed two tables of stone like the first, and went up the mountain with the two tables of stone in my [one] hand."
Deuteronomy,10,4,"And the Lord wrote on the tables as at the first writing, the Ten Commandments which the Lord had spoken to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly; and the Lord gave them to me."
Deuteronomy,10,5,"And I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as the Lord commanded me."
Deuteronomy,10,6,"(The Israelites journeyed from the wells of the sons of Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried, and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead."
Deuteronomy,10,7,"From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and then to Jotbathah, a land of brooks [dividing the valley]."
Deuteronomy,10,8,"At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister to Him and to bless in His name unto this day."
Deuteronomy,10,9,"Therefore Levi has no part or inheritance with his brethren; the Lord is his inheritance, as the Lord your God promised him.)"
Deuteronomy,10,10,"And I [Moses] stayed on the mountain, as the first time, forty days and nights, and the Lord listened to me at that time also; the Lord would not destroy you."
Deuteronomy,10,11,"And the Lord said to me, Arise, journey on before the people, that they may go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give to them."
Deuteronomy,10,12,"And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you but [reverently] to fear the Lord your God, [that is] to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve the Lord your God with all your [mind and] heart and with your entire being,"
Deuteronomy,10,13,To keep the commandments of the Lord and His statutes which I command you today for your good?
Deuteronomy,10,14,"Behold, the heavens and the heaven of heavens belong to the Lord your God, the earth also, with all that is in it and on it."
Deuteronomy,10,15,"Yet the Lord had a delight in loving your fathers, and He chose their descendants after them, you above all peoples, as it is this day."
Deuteronomy,10,16,So circumcise the foreskin of your [minds and] hearts; be no longer stubborn and hardened.
Deuteronomy,10,17,"For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, the terrible God, Who is not partial and takes no bribe."
Deuteronomy,10,18,"He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the stranger or temporary resident and gives him food and clothing."
Deuteronomy,10,19,"Therefore love the stranger and sojourner, for you were strangers and sojourners in the land of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,10,20,"You shall [reverently] fear the Lord your God; you shall serve Him and cling to Him, and by His name and presence you shall swear."
Deuteronomy,10,21,"He is your praise; He is your God, Who has done for you these great and terrible things which your eyes have seen."
Deuteronomy,10,22,"Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons in all, and now the Lord your God has made you as the stars of the heavens for multitude."
Deuteronomy,11,1,"THEREFORE YOU shall love the Lord your God and keep His charge, His statutes, His precepts, and His commandments always."
Deuteronomy,11,2,"And know this day–for I am not speaking to your children who have not [personally] known and seen it–the instruction and discipline of the Lord your God: His greatness, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm;"
Deuteronomy,11,3,His signs and His deeds which He did in Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land;
Deuteronomy,11,4,"And what He did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and chariots, how He made the waters of the Red Sea flow over them as they pursued you, and how the Lord has destroyed them to this day;"
Deuteronomy,11,5,And what He did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place;
Deuteronomy,11,6,"And what He did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben, how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up them, their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel. [Num. 26:9, 10.]"
Deuteronomy,11,7,For your eyes have seen all the great work of the Lord which He did.
Deuteronomy,11,8,"Therefore you shall keep all the commandments which I command you today, that you may be strong and go in and possess the land which you go across [the Jordan] to possess,"
Deuteronomy,11,9,"And that you may live long in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers to give to them and to their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Deuteronomy,11,10,"For the land which you go in to possess is not like the land of Egypt, from which you came out, where you sowed your seed and watered it with your foot laboriously as in a garden of vegetables."
Deuteronomy,11,11,"But the land which you enter to possess is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water of the rain of the heavens,"
Deuteronomy,11,12,A land for which the Lord your God cares; the eyes of the Lord your God are always upon it from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
Deuteronomy,11,13,And if you will diligently heed My commandments which I command you this day–to love the Lord your God and to serve Him with all your [mind and] heart and with your entire being–
Deuteronomy,11,14,"I will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil."

Deuteronomy,11,17,"And the Lord's anger be kindled against you, and He shut up the heavens so that there will be no rain and the land will not yield its fruit, and you perish quickly off the good land which the Lord gives you."
Deuteronomy,11,18,"Therefore you shall lay up these My words in your [minds and] hearts and in your [entire] being, and bind them for a sign upon your hands and as forehead bands between your eyes."
Deuteronomy,11,19,"And you shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you rise up."
Deuteronomy,11,20,"And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and on your gates,"
Deuteronomy,11,21,"That your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth."
Deuteronomy,11,22,"For if you diligently keep all this commandment which I command you to do, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave to Him–"
Deuteronomy,11,23,"Then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than you."
Deuteronomy,11,24,"Every place upon which the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness to Lebanon, and from the River, the river Euphrates, to the western sea [the Mediterranean] your territory shall be."
Deuteronomy,11,25,"There shall no man be able to stand before you; the Lord your God shall lay the fear and the dread of you upon all the land that you shall tread, as He has said to you."
Deuteronomy,11,26,"Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse–"
Deuteronomy,11,27,The blessing if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you this day;
Deuteronomy,11,28,"And the curse if you will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God, but turn aside from the way which I command you this day to go after other gods, which you have not known."
Deuteronomy,11,29,"And when the Lord your God has brought you into the land which you go to possess, you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal. [Josh. 8:33.]"
Deuteronomy,11,30,"Are they not beyond the Jordan, west of the road, where the sun goes down, in the land of the Canaanites living in the Arabah opposite Gilgal, beside the oaks or terebinths of Moreh?"
Deuteronomy,11,31,"For you are to cross over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God gives you, and you shall possess it and live in it."
Deuteronomy,11,32,And you shall be watchful to do all the statutes and ordinances which I set before you this day.
Deuteronomy,12,1,"THESE ARE the statutes and ordinances which you shall be watchful to do in the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, gives you to possess all the days you live on the earth."
Deuteronomy,12,2,"You shall surely destroy all the places where the nations you dispossess served their gods, upon the high mountains and the hills and under every green tree."
Deuteronomy,12,3,You shall break down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and burn their Asherim with fire; you shall hew down the graven images of their gods and destroy their name out of that place.
Deuteronomy,12,4,You shall not behave so toward the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,12,5,"But you shall seek the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put His Name and make His dwelling place, and there shall you come;"
Deuteronomy,12,6,"And there you shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the offering of your hands, and your vows and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock."
Deuteronomy,12,7,"And there you shall eat before the Lord your God, and you shall rejoice in all to which you put your hand, you and your households, in which the Lord your God has blessed you."
Deuteronomy,12,8,"You shall not do according to all we do here [in the camp] this day, every man doing whatever looks right in his own eyes."
Deuteronomy,12,9,For you have not yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the Lord your God gives you.
Deuteronomy,12,10,"But when you go over the Jordan and dwell in the land which the Lord your God causes you to inherit, and He gives you rest from all your enemies round about so that you dwell in safety,"
Deuteronomy,12,11,"Then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause His Name [and His Presence] to dwell there; to it you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes and what the hand presents [as a first gift from the fruits of the ground], and all your choicest offerings which you vow to the Lord."
Deuteronomy,12,12,"And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God, you and your sons and your daughters, and your menservants and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your towns, since he has no part or inheritance with you."
Deuteronomy,12,13,Be watchful not to offer your burnt offerings in every place you see.
Deuteronomy,12,14,"But in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all I command you."
Deuteronomy,12,15,"However, you may kill and eat flesh in any of your towns whenever you desire, according to the provision for the support of life with which the Lord your God has blessed you; those [ceremonially] unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle and the hart."
Deuteronomy,12,16,Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it upon the ground as water.
Deuteronomy,12,17,"You may not eat within your towns the tithe of your grain or of your new wine or of your oil, or the firstlings of your herd or flock, or anything you have vowed, or your freewill offerings, or the offerings from your hand [of garden products]."
Deuteronomy,12,18,"But you shall eat them before the Lord your God in the place which the Lord your God shall choose, you and your son and your daughter, your manservant and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your towns; and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God in all that you undertake."
Deuteronomy,12,19,Take heed not to forsake or neglect the Levite [God's minister] as long as you live in your land.
Deuteronomy,12,20,"When the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as He promised you, and you say, I will eat flesh, because you crave flesh, you may eat flesh whenever you desire."
Deuteronomy,12,21,"If the place where the Lord your God has chosen to put His Name [and Presence] is too far from you, then you shall kill from your herd or flock which the Lord has given you, as I [Moses] have commanded you; eat in your towns as much as you desire."
Deuteronomy,12,22,"Just as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so you may eat of it [but not offer it]; the unclean and the clean alike may eat of it."

Deuteronomy,31,30,And Moses spoke in the hearing of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song until they were ended:
Deuteronomy,32,1,"GIVE EAR, O heavens, and I [Moses] will speak; and let the earth hear the words of my mouth."
Deuteronomy,32,2,"My message shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the light rain upon the tender grass, and as the showers upon the herb."

Deuteronomy,32,21,They have moved Me to jealousy with what is not God; they have angered Me with their idols. So I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people; I will anger them with a foolish nation.

Deuteronomy,32,30,"How could one have chased a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had delivered them up?"
Deuteronomy,32,31,"For their rock is not like our Rock, even our enemies themselves judge this."
