Hosea,1,1,"This is the message that the LORD gave to Hosea, the son of Beeri. He gave this message during the time that Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah were kings of Judah. It was during the time when Joash's son Jeroboam was the king of Israel."
Hosea,1,2,"The LORD began to speak to Hosea with a message for his people. The LORD said to Hosea, ‘Go and marry a prostitute. She will give birth to children for you, as a prostitute. That will show how my people have not been faithful to me. They have turned away from me, the LORD, and they have served other gods.’"
Hosea,1,3,"So Hosea married a woman called Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim. Then Gomer became pregnant. She gave birth to a son for Hosea."
Hosea,1,4,"The LORD said to Hosea, ‘Call him Jezreel. This is because I will soon punish the family of Jehu. I will punish them because Jehu murdered people at Jezreel. I will cause the kingdom of Israel to come to an end."
Hosea,1,5,"At that time, I will completely destroy the power of Israel's army in Jezreel valley.’"
Hosea,1,6,"Gomer became pregnant again. She gave birth to a daughter. The LORD said to Hosea, ‘Call her Lo-Ruhamah. This is because I will not continue to show love to Israel's people. I will not forgive their sins any more."
Hosea,1,7,"But I will continue to love the people of Judah. I will save them from the power of their enemies. I will not use weapons to do this in a battle. I will not use an army, or horses, or chariots. Instead, it will be the power of the LORD their God that saves them.’"
Hosea,1,8,"After Lo-Ruhamah stopped drinking Gomer's milk, Gomer became pregnant again. She gave birth to another son."
Hosea,1,9,"Then the LORD said, ‘Call him Lo-Ammi. This is because you Israelites are not my people. I am not your God.’"
Hosea,1,10,"In the future, nobody will be able to count the number of Israel's people. They will be as much as the sand on the shore of the sea. God has said to them, ‘You are not my people.’ But at that time, he will say to them, ‘You are children of the God who lives!’"
Hosea,1,11,Then the people of Judah and the people of Israel will come together again. They will choose a single leader to rule them. They will return to live in their own land. They will know that the day of Jezreel is a great day.
Hosea,2,1,"Then you will tell your brothers, ‘Ammi: you are my people.’ You will tell your sisters, ‘Ruhamah: he loves you.’"
Hosea,2,2,"My children, warn your mother! She is no longer my wife. I am not her husband. Tell her that she must stop living like a prostitute. She must stop having sex with other men instead of me."
Hosea,2,3,"If she does not return to me, I will remove all her clothes. She will have nothing to wear, like the day when she was born. She will be ashamed. Her life will be useless and empty, like a dry land that has no water. Then I will leave her to die because she has no water to drink."
Hosea,2,4,"I will not show love to her children, because she became pregnant with them as a prostitute."
Hosea,2,5,"Yes, their mother has lived as a prostitute. She became pregnant because she had sex with other men instead of with her husband. She should be ashamed. She herself said, ‘I will go and sleep with my lovers. They give me food and water. They give me wool, linen, olive oil and wine.’"
Hosea,2,6,"So I will stop her living like that. I will put thorn bushes around her, like a wall. Then she will not be able to go anywhere that she likes."
Hosea,2,7,"She will run after her lovers, but she will not catch them. She will look for them, but she will not find them. Then she will say, ‘Now I will return to my husband, as before. Life was better for me then than it is now.’"
Hosea,2,8,"She did not realize that I was the one who gave her everything that she needed. I gave her grain, wine and olive oil. I even gave her lots of silver and gold. But she used my gifts to worship Baal instead of me."
Hosea,2,9,So now I will take back the grain and the new wine that I gave her at harvest time. I will take away the wool and the linen. She will have no clothes to cover her bare body.
Hosea,2,10,I will remove her clothes for all her lovers to see her as she really is. Nobody will be able to rescue her from my power.
Hosea,2,11,I will stop the festivals that she enjoys each year. I will stop her feasts at the times of a new moon and on Sabbath days. I will stop all her parties.
Hosea,2,12,I will destroy her vines and her fig trees. She said that those were the things that her lovers paid to her. But I will make her gardens become like a forest. Only wild animals will eat the fruit from those trees.
Hosea,2,13,"I will punish her because she burned incense to the idols of Baal. I will punish her because she made herself beautiful with jewels when she went to sleep with her lovers. I will punish her because she did those things but she forgot about me.
That is what the LORD says."
Hosea,2,14,"But listen! One day, I will speak kind words to her. I will lead her into the wilderness. I will tell her that I love her."
Hosea,2,15,"There, I will give her the vineyards that she had before. I will change Trouble Valley into a place where there is hope. She will be happy with me there, as she was when she was young. That was the time when she came out of Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"The LORD says this: When that happens, you will call me, ‘My husband’. You will never again call me, ‘Baal, my master’."
Hosea,2,17,I will never again let you speak the names of the idols of Baal.
Hosea,2,18,"At that time, I will make a promise that nothing will hurt my people. I will make an agreement with the wild animals, with the birds in the fields and with the animals that move along the ground. I will remove from their land all the weapons that soldiers use to fight wars. I will destroy their swords and their bows and arrows. I will allow my people to live safely in peace."
Hosea,2,19,"Israel, I will make you my wife for ever.
I will promise to help you in a way that is right and fair.
I will be kind to you with a faithful love."
Hosea,2,20,"I will promise to be a faithful husband for you.
Then you will know me as the LORD."
Hosea,2,21,"The LORD says this:
At that time, I will answer your prayers.
I will put clouds in the sky,
and the clouds will send rain to the earth."
Hosea,2,22,"The earth will feed the grain, the wine and the olive oil.
My people will be happy to say, ‘Jezreel: God plants.’"
Hosea,2,23,"I will plant them safely in the land.
I will show love to ‘No love’ (Lo-Ruhamah).
I will say to ‘Not my people’ (Lo-Ammi), ‘You are my people.’
And they will say to me, ‘You are my God.’"
Hosea,3,1,"Then the LORD said to me, ‘Go back to your wife and show that you love her. Do that, even though she loves another man and is not faithful to you. The LORD loves the Israelites in the same way. They turn away from him to worship other gods. They love to offer gifts of raisins to idols. But the LORD still loves them.’"
Hosea,3,2,So I paid 15 pieces of silver and 50 kilograms of grain to get my wife back.
Hosea,3,3,"Then I told her, ‘You must stay at home with me for many days. You must not live as a prostitute. You must not have sex with any other man. I will also be faithful to you.’"
Hosea,3,4,"In the same way, the Israelites will have to live for many days without a king or any other leader. They will not be able to make sacrifices. They will not have their pillars, their ephods or their idols to help them."
Hosea,3,5,"After that time, the Israelites will turn back to the LORD their God. They will serve their king, a descendant of King David. In the future, they will obey the LORD with fear, and they will receive his good gifts."
Hosea,4,1,"Israelites, listen to the LORD's message! The LORD accuses the people who live in Israel of these bad things:
‘Nobody in the land of Israel is faithful. They have no true love. They do not want to know God."
Hosea,4,2,"They curse people, they tell lies, they murder people, they rob people. They are guilty of adultery. They continue to kill more and more people."
Hosea,4,3,"Because of this, the land will become like a desert. Everyone who lives there will become weak. Everything will die: the wild animals, the birds, and even the fish in the sea."
Hosea,4,4,Do not argue among yourselves or accuse one another. It is you priests who are guilty.
Hosea,4,5,"You are always falling over. In the day and in the night, you trip and you fall. The false prophets are the same as you. So I will destroy Israel, your mother."
Hosea,4,6,"The people do not know me. Because of that, they will come to an end. You refuse to respect my authority, so I will remove you as my priests. You refuse to obey the law of your God, so I will refuse to accept your children as my priests."
Hosea,4,7,"The more priests that there are among you, the more sins they do against me. They should have received honour as priests, but I will make them ashamed."
Hosea,4,8,"They get food to eat when the people bring their sin offerings to them. So the priests are happy when the people do bad things, because they get more food to eat."
Hosea,4,9,The people do whatever the priests do. I will punish them all for the bad things that they do. I will give them what their sins deserve.
Hosea,4,10,"They will eat, but they will still be hungry. They will have sex with prostitutes, but they will still have no children. This will happen because they have turned away from the LORD."
Hosea,4,11,"Instead, they worship other gods.
My people cannot think properly because they drink too much old wine and new wine."
Hosea,4,12,"They ask wooden idols to tell them what to do! A stick tells them what will happen in the future! They have turned away from me and they have lost their way. They have not been faithful to me, their God, as a prostitute is not faithful to her husband."
Hosea,4,13,"They offer sacrifices on the tops of the mountains. They burn offerings on the hills. They do this under the oak trees, the poplar trees and the other big trees. They enjoy the shade under those trees. As a result, your daughters serve the false gods as prostitutes. Your sons' wives are also guilty of adultery."
Hosea,4,14,"But I will not punish them for those sins, because the men are just as guilty! They sleep with prostitutes. They join with prostitutes to offer sacrifices to the false gods.
All of this shows that people who cannot think properly destroy themselves.’"
Hosea,4,15,"You people of Israel are not faithful to the LORD. But do not let the people of Judah become guilty of the same sins. Do not travel to Gilgal to worship! Do not go to Beth Aven! Do not say, ‘I promise this is true, as surely as the LORD lives’."
Hosea,4,16,Israel's people have turned against the LORD. They are like a young cow that refuses to obey its owner. So how can the LORD take care of them? Will he put them in a big field to eat the grass like lambs?
Hosea,4,17,The people of Israel enjoy their idols. Do not go near them!
Hosea,4,18,"After they have drunk enough wine, they are happy to sleep with prostitutes. They enjoy doing things that should make them ashamed."
Hosea,4,19,Now a strong wind will pick them up and take them away. They will become ashamed because of their sacrifices to false gods.
Hosea,5,1,"‘Listen to this, you priests! Listen carefully, you Israelites! Listen, you people of the royal family! You are guilty and you deserve punishment. You have caused trouble for people with your trap at Mizpah. You have caught people in your net at Tabor mountain."
Hosea,5,2,People have turned against me and they have murdered many people. So I will warn them all and I will punish them.
Hosea,5,3,I know what the people of Ephraim are like. The Israelites cannot hide their sins from me. You are no better than prostitutes! You can no longer serve me as my people.
Hosea,5,4,"Yes, the sins of the Israelites do not allow them to return to me, the LORD their God. They are not faithful to me and they love to worship idols. They do not want to know me."
Hosea,5,5,"The Israelites are proud of what they do, and that shows that they are guilty. Their sins cause them to fall into great trouble. That will happen to the people of Israel and Ephraim. And the people of Judah will fall with them."
Hosea,5,6,"They take their sheep and cows to offer as sacrifices to the LORD. They want the LORD to help them, but he does not answer them. They cannot find him because he has gone away from them."
Hosea,5,7,They have turned against the LORD. Their children do not belong to him. They enjoy the new moon feast. But that will soon destroy them and the crops in their fields.’
Hosea,5,8,"‘Make a noise with your horns in Gibeah!
Make a noise with your trumpets in Ramah!
Warn the people in Beth Aven of danger!
Men of Benjamin's tribe, prepare to fight!"
Hosea,5,9,"The day for Ephraim's punishment will soon come.
That will be the end of them!
I make this promise to all the tribes of Israel.
It will certainly happen!"
Hosea,5,10,"The leaders of Judah are not honest.
They are like people who move the stones that show the edge of their land.
So I will punish them with my strong anger."
Hosea,5,11,"Terrible trouble will come to Ephraim's people.
They will receive great punishment.
They deserve that because they chose to worship idols."
Hosea,5,12,"I will destroy the people of Ephraim,
as a moth eats cloth.
I will also destroy the people of Judah,
as ants destroy wood."
Hosea,5,13,"Ephraim's people knew that they were not well.
Judah's people knew that they had wounds.
Ephraim's leaders expected Assyria to help them.
They asked Assyria's great king for help.
But he is not able to make you well.
He cannot make your wounds better."
Hosea,5,14,"I will attack Ephraim's people like a lion.
I will also attack Judah's people like a young lion.
I myself will tear them into pieces.
I will carry them away.
Nobody will be able to rescue them."
Hosea,5,15,"Then I will return to my place.
I will leave them to receive their full punishment.
When they have suffered enough, they will turn back to me.
They will want to serve me again.’"
Hosea,6,1,"‘Listen! We should return to serve the LORD.
He has torn us to pieces, but now he will make us well again.
He has hurt us, but now he will make our wounds better."
Hosea,6,2,"He will soon make us strong again.
After three days, we will have new lives.
Then we can live together with him."
Hosea,6,3,"We should respect the LORD's authority.
We must try to know him better.
Then he will certainly come to rescue us.
He will come to us as surely as the sun appears each morning.
He will help us as surely as the rain comes in spring
and it makes the ground wet for plants to grow.’"
Hosea,6,4,"‘People of Ephraim and Judah, can I forgive you so easily?
Your love for me soon disappears.
It goes away as quickly as mist or dew in the morning."
Hosea,6,5,"I sent my prophets to warn you.
They gave you my messages that I would punish you.
Now that punishment will certainly happen to you!
I will suddenly come to judge you,
like the sun that rises at dawn."
Hosea,6,6,"It is faithful love that makes me happy.
That would be better than your sacrifices to me.
You should know me as your God.
That would be better than your burnt offerings."
Hosea,6,7,"Like Adam, my people did not obey the covenant that I had made with them.
They did not serve me faithfully."
Hosea,6,8,"All the people of Gilead do evil things.
The blood from their murders lies on the streets."
Hosea,6,9,"The priests join together like robbers.
They hide themselves and they are ready to attack.
They wait on the road to Shechem,
ready to murder people who pass that way.
They have done wicked things."
Hosea,6,10,"I have seen people do disgusting things in Israel.
Like a prostitute, Ephraim's people serve false gods.
Yes, the Israelites have made themselves unclean."
Hosea,6,11,"People of Judah, I will also punish you when the right time comes.
But I do want to bring my people back.’"
Hosea,7,1,"‘Yes, I want to make the people of Israel healthy again,
but I see how great their sins are.
Samaria's people do many evil things.
They deceive one another,
they take things from other people's homes,
and they attack people in the streets to rob them."
Hosea,7,2,"They do not understand that I remember all their sins.
The wicked things that they do are everywhere.
Wherever they go, I see their sins very clearly."
Hosea,7,3,"The king is happy to see the evil things that his people do.
The leaders are also happy when the people cheat and tell lies."
Hosea,7,4,"None of them serves me faithfully.
They are always ready to do bad things,
like an oven that has a hot fire inside it.
When the baker is ready to bake his bread,
he makes the fire even hotter."
Hosea,7,5,"On a day when the king has a feast,
the leaders drink too much wine.
The king and the leaders join with other people to do foolish things."
Hosea,7,6,"But the leaders are planning to murder the king.
Their anger is like the fire of an oven.
It burns slowly inside them all through the night.
But in the morning the fire is too strong to hold."
Hosea,7,7,"They are so angry that they kill their rulers.
Now all their kings are dead.
None of them calls out to me for help.’"
Hosea,7,8,"‘Ephraim's people have mixed themselves with people of other nations.
So they have become useless, like bread that is not properly cooked."
Hosea,7,9,"Foreign people have taken away Israel's strength.
But the Israelites do not realize what is happening!
They have become like an old man with grey hair.
But they do not realize how weak they are."
Hosea,7,10,"Israel's people are too proud to change.
This shows that they are guilty.
They still refuse to turn back to me, the LORD their God.
In all their troubles, they do not look for my help."
Hosea,7,11,"Ephraim has become like a silly dove.
He cannot decide where to go.
The Israelites ask Egypt to help them.
Then they decide to ask Assyria instead."
Hosea,7,12,"When they fly around like that,
I will throw my net over them.
I will catch them like birds that fly in the sky.
I will punish them as they join together to do evil things."
Hosea,7,13,"Terrible trouble will happen to them,
because they have gone away from me.
They have turned against me, so they will die.
I wanted to rescue them,
but they have told lies about me."
Hosea,7,14,"They do not pray and trust me to help them.
Instead, they lie down on their beds and they weep loudly.
They cut their bodies to get grain and wine.
They turn away from me."
Hosea,7,15,"I taught them what was right. I made them strong.
But now they have decided to do evil things against me."
Hosea,7,16,"They do not look up to me for help.
They are as useless as a bow that cannot shoot an arrow properly.
Their leaders are proud of their own strength,
but they will die in battle.
Then the people of Egypt will laugh at them.’"
Hosea,8,1,"The LORD says, ‘Warn the people of danger!
My people have not obeyed the covenant that I made with them.
They have refused to obey my laws.
So an enemy army will come to attack their land,
like an eagle that is ready to fly down and catch them."
Hosea,8,2,"Israel's people call out to me for help.
They say, “We know you as our God.”"
Hosea,8,3,"But they have refused to do what is good and right.
So their enemies will chase after them."
Hosea,8,4,"My people chose kings to rule them,
but they did not ask me about it.
They chose people to lead them, but I did not agree.
They used their silver and their gold
to make idols for themselves.
But that will destroy them in the end."
Hosea,8,5,"People of Samaria, you have made an image of a calf as your idol.
But I hate that idol!
I am very angry with the Israelites.
How much longer will it be before I have to punish them?"
Hosea,8,6,"That idol is not a true god!
An Israelite worker with special skills made it.
Samaria's idol of a calf will break into pieces!"
Hosea,8,7,"Like a farmer, Israel's people have planted the wind.
So their harvest will be a strong storm!
The crops that grow in their fields will not have any grain.
So they will not be able to make flour for bread.
Even if the crops do make some grain,
foreign people will take it for themselves."
Hosea,8,8,"Israel will become lost among the other nations.
It will be like a useless pot that nobody needs."
Hosea,8,9,"Israel's rulers have gone to Assyria for help.
They are like a wild donkey that goes here and there.
Ephraim's people have paid money to get help from other nations.
as if they are paying for lovers."
Hosea,8,10,"Yes, they have paid money to get friends who will help them.
But I will soon bring them together to punish them.
A great king will be cruel to them and they will receive much pain."
Hosea,8,11,"Ephraim's people have built many altars to make sin offerings.
But the altars have become places where the people do even more sins!"
Hosea,8,12,"I carefully explained my laws to my people.
But they do not accept my laws as their own."
Hosea,8,13,"Israel's people offer sacrifices to me,
and they eat the meat from those sacrifices.
But their sacrifices do not please me.
I know that they are guilty of wicked things.
Soon I will punish them for their sins.
They will have to return to Egypt."
Hosea,8,14,"Israel's people have built beautiful palaces.
But they have forgotten me, who made them into a nation!
Judah's people have built many strong cities.
But I will send fire to destroy their cities and their strong buildings.’"
Hosea,9,1,"People of Israel, do not shout with joy,
as the people of other nations do at their festivals.
You have not been faithful to me, your God.
Like a prostitute, you sell yourselves to foreign gods
that you worship on the threshing floors."
Hosea,9,2,"But the threshing floors will not provide enough grain to feed the people.
The winepresses will not give them enough new wine."
Hosea,9,3,"The Israelites will not remain in the LORD's land.
They will have to return to Egypt.
In Assyria, they will have to eat food that is unclean."
Hosea,9,4,"They will not pour out wine as an offering to the LORD.
Their sacrifices will not please him.
Instead, their offerings will be like food that people eat at a funeral.
Anyone who eats it becomes unclean.
They may eat the food to feed themselves,
but they cannot offer it to the LORD in his temple."
Hosea,9,5,"So what will you do on your festival days?
You will no longer be able to worship the LORD properly."
Hosea,9,6,"Listen! Perhaps some Israelites will escape when Assyria's army attacks.
But then Egypt's army will take hold of them.
They will die in Memphis and people will bury them there.
Weeds will grow all over their valuable silver things.
Thorn bushes will grow in their homes."
Hosea,9,7,"The time for Israel's punishment has arrived!
The LORD must now pay them back for their sins.
The Israelites will soon know about it!
You do many sins and you hate the LORD.
Because of that, you say that his prophets are fools.
You think that his messengers are crazy."
Hosea,9,8,"God has sent his prophet to warn the people of Ephraim.
But wherever he goes, people try to stop him.
They speak angry words against him, even in the temple of his God."
Hosea,9,9,"The Israelites do very wicked things,
like the terrible sins that they did at Gibeah.
God will not forget the wicked things that they have done.
He will surely punish them for their sins."
Hosea,9,10,"The LORD says,
‘When I first found Israel, they gave me pleasure.
It was as if I had found grapes in the wilderness.
Your ancestors made me happy,
like the first fruit on a young fig tree.
But then they came to the god, Baal-Peor.
They began to worship that disgusting idol.
They became as disgusting as the idol that they loved so much."
Hosea,9,11,"The great things that Israel enjoys will soon disappear.
They will be like birds that fly away!
The women of Israel will no longer give birth to children.
They will not even become pregnant."
Hosea,9,12,"But even if they do have children,
I will cause them all to die so that none are still alive.
It will be a terrible time for the Israelites,
because I will turn away from them."
Hosea,9,13,"At one time, I saw that Ephraim's land was a beautiful place, like Tyre.
But now Ephraim's people must bring out their children
for an enemy to kill them.’"
Hosea,9,14,"LORD, what should I ask you to give to these people?
Make it impossible for their women to give birth!
Stop the milk from their breasts to feed their babies!"
Hosea,9,15,"The LORD says,
‘They started to do evil things at Gilgal.
It was there that I began to hate them.
Because they do evil things, I will chase them out of my land.
I will not love them any more.
Their leaders have all turned against me."
Hosea,9,16,"Ephraim's people are very sick.
They are like a plant that has dry roots
and it gives no fruit.
Even if they give birth to children that they love very much,
I will kill those children.’"
Hosea,9,17,"My God will not accept them as his people,
because they have not obeyed him.
They will have no home of their own.
They will have to live among different nations."
Hosea,10,1,"Israel was like a healthy vine that had lots of grapes.
But as the Israelites became more and more rich,
they built more and more altars.
As their land gave more crops,
they made the pillars that they worshipped more beautiful."
Hosea,10,2,"They do not truly trust God.
They are guilty and they must receive their punishment.
The LORD will break their altars.
He will destroy their special pillars."
Hosea,10,3,"Soon these people will say, ‘We did not respect the LORD's authority.
Because of that we have no king.
But even if we had a king now, he could not do anything to help us.’"
Hosea,10,4,"They promise to do many things,
but they never do what they promise.
They make useless agreements.
So people accuse each other in the courts.
They are like weeds that grow in a farmer's field."
Hosea,10,5,"The people who live in Samaria will be afraid.
They will worry about their image of a calf at Beth Aven.
They will weep because it will go away from them.
The priests who serve the idol will cry too.
They know that an enemy will take away their great and beautiful idol."
Hosea,10,6,"Assyria's army will carry the idol away.
It will be a gift to give honour to Assyria's great king.
Ephraim's people will feel ashamed.
They will be sorry that they trusted in their wooden idol."
Hosea,10,7,"The people of Samaria and their king will come to an end.
They will be like a small stick that water carries away."
Hosea,10,8,"The wicked altars on the hills will break into pieces.
These are places where Israel's people have done bad things.
Thorn bushes and weeds will grow all over their altars.
Then the people will say to the mountains, ‘Hide us!’
They will say to the hills, ‘Fall on us!’"
Hosea,10,9,"The LORD says,
‘People of Israel, you have continued to do bad things,
since the time that you were at Gibeah.
When the people did evil things at Gibeah,
war destroyed them as a result."
Hosea,10,10,"When I decide that the time is right,
I will punish the Israelites.
Because of their many sins,
I will bring other nations to attack them.
Their enemies will tie them up with chains."
Hosea,10,11,"Ephraim was like a cow that I had taught to stamp on grain.
She loved to work for me.
But now I will make her do hard work!
I will put a heavy yoke on her beautiful neck.
Judah will also have to plough the ground.
Jacob's descendants must work to dig up the hard ground."
Hosea,10,12,"Be like a farmer who plants good seed.
Plant things that are good and right.
Then your harvest will be faithful love.
Plough the hard ground and prepare it for the LORD to bless you.
It is time for you to turn back to the LORD.
Then he will bless you with good things,
like rain that falls on the ground!"
Hosea,10,13,"But instead, you have planted evil things.
So your harvest is terrible trouble.
The food that you eat comes from your lies.
You trusted in your own strength to save you.
You thought that your strong army would keep you safe."
Hosea,10,14,"So you will soon hear the noise of war.
Enemies will destroy all your strong buildings.
It will be like the time that King Shalman's army destroyed Beth Arbel.
In that battle, cruel soldiers killed mothers together with their children."
Hosea,10,15,"The same thing will happen to you, people of Bethel,
because of the wicked things that you have done.
When the day of your punishment arrives,
the king of Israel will surely die.’"
Hosea,11,1,"The LORD says,
‘When Israel was a child, I loved him as my son.
I called my son to come out of Egypt."
Hosea,11,2,"But the more I spoke to Israel's people,
the more they turned away from me.
They offered sacrifices to the images of Baal.
They burned incense to give honour to their idols."
Hosea,11,3,"I was the one who taught this child, Ephraim, to walk!
I held their hand and I led them.
I took care of them,
but they did not understand this."
Hosea,11,4,"I loved them and I was kind to them.
I led them as their guide.
I gave them rest from their hard work.
I bent down to feed them."
Hosea,11,5,"But they refuse to turn back to me.
So they must return to Egypt.
Assyria will rule over them."
Hosea,11,6,"War will come to their cities.
Enemies will break down the strong city gates.
War will destroy my people and all their wicked ideas."
Hosea,11,7,"My people have decided to turn away from me.
That is all that they can think about.
They call up to a God who rules above,
but he will not help them."
Hosea,11,8,"Israel, I cannot leave you alone.
I cannot let you belong to someone else.
I cannot destroy you, as I did to Admah and Zeboiim.
I now realize that I love you too much.
I could never destroy you completely."
Hosea,11,9,"I am very angry with you,
but I will not punish you so much.
I will never destroy my people, Ephraim.
This is because I am God. I am not a human.
I am the Holy God who is with you.
I will not come to destroy you in my anger."
Hosea,11,10,"I will roar loudly like a lion,
so that my children come to follow me.
When I roar, my children will shake with fear,
as they come from the west."
Hosea,11,11,"They will return to me, like birds that fly from Egypt.
They will come like doves that fly from Assyria.
They will be afraid, as they return.
I will bring them back to live in their homes again.’
That is what the LORD says."
Hosea,11,12,"The LORD says,
‘Ephraim's people are always speaking lies to me.
Yes, Israel's descendants try to deceive me.
But Judah's people have stayed with God as their guide.
They continue to be faithful to the Holy God.’"
Hosea,12,1,"Ephraim's people chase after useless things all the time.
They think that they can catch the wind that comes from the east!
But the result is more violence and lies.
They make an agreement with Assyria to get their help.
They also send their olive oil to Egypt to ask for their help."
Hosea,12,2,"The LORD is ready to accuse Judah's people in a court of law.
He will punish Jacob's descendants for the bad way that they live.
He will punish them as their sins deserve."
Hosea,12,3,"Before Jacob was born, he cheated his brother.
He did that when they were both inside their mother's body.
When Jacob became a man, he fought against God."
Hosea,12,4,"He fought against an angel and he won.
He wept and he asked God to bless him.
There at Bethel, Jacob met with God. God spoke to him there."
Hosea,12,5,"This was the LORD God Almighty!
We know him as the LORD, his special name."
Hosea,12,6,"So now, you must return to your God.
You must show faithful love for each other.
You must judge people in a fair way.
You must be patient. Trust God to come and help you."
Hosea,12,7,"Your traders love to cheat people.
They use false weights and measures."
Hosea,12,8,"Ephraim's people proudly say,
‘We are rich! We have become very rich!
In all the ways that we have found riches,
nobody can accuse us.
We have not really done anything that is a sin!’"
Hosea,12,9,"God says,
‘Remember that I am the LORD your God!
I brought you out of Egypt, where you were slaves.
Now I will make you live in tents again,
as you did before, in the wilderness."
Hosea,12,10,"I gave my messages to the prophets.
I showed them many visions.
I used stories for the prophets to teach the people about me."
Hosea,12,11,"The people in Gilead do wicked things.
They will become as useless as their idols.
At Gilgal, the people offer bulls as sacrifices on their altars.
Those altars will be like heaps of stones in a farmer's field.’"
Hosea,12,12,"Jacob ran away to the land of Aram.
He worked there as a shepherd so that he could get a wife."
Hosea,12,13,"The LORD used a prophet to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.
He used a prophet to keep them safe in the wilderness."
Hosea,12,14,"But Ephraim's people have made the LORD very angry.
He will punish them with death for their terrible sins.
Their Lord will pay them back as they deserve,
because they have insulted him."
Hosea,13,1,"In past times, when the leaders of Israel spoke, the people were afraid.
The people respected their leaders.
But the people became guilty when they worshipped Baal.
Because of that, they died."
Hosea,13,2,"Now the Israelites continue to do more and more sins.
They use metal to make idols for themselves.
They use clever skills to make idols from silver.
All their idols are only things that people have made themselves.
People offer sacrifices to the image of a calf.
They say, ‘Kiss the calf!’"
Hosea,13,3,"So those people will soon disappear!
They will quickly disappear like mist or dew in the morning.
They will be like chaff that the wind blows away from a threshing floor.
They will be like smoke that disappears out of an open window."
Hosea,13,4,"The LORD says,
‘I am the LORD your God.
I brought you out from Egypt.
You must not serve any other God.
No one else can save you except me."
Hosea,13,5,"I took care of you in the wilderness,
where it was very hot and dry."
Hosea,13,6,"I gave food to my people, so that they were not hungry.
But when they had enough to eat, they became proud.
As a result, they forgot about me."
Hosea,13,7,"So I will attack them like a lion.
I will be like a leopard that waits beside the road.
It is ready to catch anything that goes that way."
Hosea,13,8,"I will attack them like an angry bear that has lost her children.
I will tear them into pieces.
I will eat them like a hungry lion.
I will attack them and kill them, like a wild animal."
Hosea,13,9,"I will destroy you, Israel.
There will be nobody to help you."
Hosea,13,10,"What has happened to your king?
He cannot save you!
Where are your rulers?
You asked me to give you rulers like the other nations have.
You said, “Give us a king and rulers.”"
Hosea,13,11,"I was angry, but I agreed to give you a king.
Now I am even more angry and I will take your king away!"
Hosea,13,12,"I have a record of Ephraim's sin.
Ephraim's people will certainly receive their punishment."
Hosea,13,13,"They will be in pain like a woman who is giving birth.
Her child is foolish. He refuses to be born!"
Hosea,13,14,"Will I save these people from the power of death?
Will I rescue them from their graves?
Death, what diseases can you bring?
What can you do to hurt my people?
I will not be kind to my people and forgive them.’"
Hosea,13,15,"Among the other nations, Israel has been successful.
It has been like a plant that grows well.
But now the LORD will send trouble.
It will be like a strong east wind that comes from the desert.
Israel's wells and springs of water will become dry.
All the valuable things that Israel has stored will disappear."
Hosea,13,16,"Samaria's people are guilty and they will receive their punishment.
They have turned against their God.
They will die in war.
Cruel enemies will kill their young children.
Soldiers will cut open their pregnant women."
Hosea,14,1,"Israel's people, return to the LORD your God!
Your sins have caused you to fall down."
Hosea,14,2,"Return to the LORD and pray to him! Say to him,
‘Please forgive all our sins.
Be kind to us as we come to you.
We will praise you with our mouths, as our sacrifice to you."
Hosea,14,3,"Assyria cannot save us.
The horses that we ride into war will not keep us safe.
We will never again say to the idols that we have made, “You are our gods.”
You are kind to children who have no family.
So please be kind to us.’"
Hosea,14,4,"The LORD says,
‘My people turned away from me, but I will forgive them.
I will love them very much.
I will not be angry with them any more."
Hosea,14,5,"I will bless Israel's people, like rain that falls on dry ground.
They will grow like beautiful flowers.
They will have strong roots, like the great trees in Lebanon."
Hosea,14,6,"They will grow like a tree that makes new branches.
They will be beautiful like olive trees.
They will have a sweet smell, like the forests in Lebanon."
Hosea,14,7,"I will give my people shade to live in safely.
They will plant crops that give them plenty of food.
They will be successful, like a vine that gives many grapes.
They will be famous, like the wine from Lebanon."
Hosea,14,8,"People of Ephraim, do not let me see your idols any more!
I will answer your prayers. I will take care of you.
I am like a strong green tree.
All the good things that you have come from me.’"
Hosea,14,9,"If you are wise, you should understand these things.
If you understand, think carefully about them.
The LORD teaches you to live in ways that are right.
Righteous people live in those good ways.
But people who turn against the LORD fall down and lose their way."
