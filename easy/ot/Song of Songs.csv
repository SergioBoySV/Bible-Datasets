Song of Songs,8,6,"Keep me near to you, like a seal over your heart.
Keep me like a seal on your arm.
Keep me there always,

It keeps hold of people as strongly as the grave does.
Love burns like a hot fire.
It burns with bright flames."

Run like a gazelle or a young deer.
Come to the mountains that have sweet spices!"
