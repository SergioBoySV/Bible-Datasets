Revelation,5,10,and made them to our God kings and priests; and they shall reign over the earth.

Revelation,6,15,"And the kings of the earth, and the great, and the chiliarchs, and the rich, and the strong, and every bondman and freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains"
Revelation,6,16,"and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and have us hidden from the face of him that sits upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb"
Revelation,6,17,"because the great day of his wrath is come, and who is able to stand?"
Revelation,7,1,"And after this I saw four angels standing upon the four corners of the earth, holding fast the four winds of the earth, that no wind might blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree."
Revelation,7,2,"And I saw another angel ascending from the sunrising, having the seal of the living God; and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it had been given to hurt the earth and the sea"

Revelation,7,14,"And I said to him, My lord, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
Revelation,7,15,"Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple, and he that sits upon the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them."
Revelation,7,16,"They shall not hunger any more, neither shall they thirst any more, nor shall the sun at all fall on them, nor any burning heat"
Revelation,7,17,"because the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall shepherd them, and shall lead them to fountains of waters of life, and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes."
Revelation,8,1,"And when it opened the seventh seal, there was silence in the heaven about half an hour."

Revelation,8,3,"And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, that he might give efficacy to the prayers of all saints at the golden altar which was before the throne."
Revelation,8,4,"And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints, out of the hand of the angel before God."
Revelation,8,5,"And the angel took the censer, and filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast it on the earth: and there were voices, and thunders and lightnings, and an earthquake."
Revelation,8,6,And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves that they might sound with their trumpets.
Revelation,8,7,"And the first sounded his trumpet: and there was hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth; and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up."
Revelation,8,8,"And the second angel sounded his trumpet: and as a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea, and the third part of the sea became blood"
Revelation,8,9,and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea which had life died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
Revelation,8,10,"And the third angel sounded his trumpet: and there fell out of the heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters."
Revelation,8,11,"And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood, and many of the men died of the waters because they were made bitter."
Revelation,8,12,"And the fourth angel sounded his trumpet: and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so that the third part of them should be darkened, and that the day should not appear for the third part of it, and the night the same."
Revelation,8,13,"And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to them that dwell upon the earth, for the remaining voices of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound."
Revelation,9,1,And the fifth angel sounded his trumpet: and I saw a star out of the heaven fallen to the earth; and there was given to it the key of the pit of the abyss.
Revelation,9,2,And it opened the pit of the abyss; and there went up smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke of the pit.
Revelation,9,3,"And out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth, and power was given to them as the scorpions of the earth have power"
Revelation,9,4,"and it was said to them, that they should not injure the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but the men who have not the seal of God on their foreheads"
Revelation,9,5,"and it was given to them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months; and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man."
Revelation,9,6,"And in those days shall men seek death, and shall in no way find it; and shall desire to die, and death flees from them."
Revelation,9,7,"And the likenesses of the locusts were like to horses prepared for war; and upon their heads as crowns like gold, and their faces as faces of men"
Revelation,9,8,"and they had hair as women's hair, and their teeth were as of lions"
Revelation,9,9,"and they had breastplates as breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to war"
Revelation,9,10,"and they have tails like scorpions, and stings; and their power was in their tails to hurt men five months."
Revelation,9,11,"They have a king over them, the angel of the abyss: his name in Hebrew, Abaddon, and in Greek he has for name Apollyon."
Revelation,9,12,"The first woe has passed. Behold, there come yet two woes after these things."
Revelation,9,13,And the sixth angel sounded his trumpet: and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God
Revelation,9,14,"saying to the sixth angel that had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound at the great river Euphrates."
Revelation,9,15,"And the four angels were loosed, who are prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they might slay the third part of men"
Revelation,9,16,and the number of the hosts of horse was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number.
Revelation,9,17,"And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those that sat upon them, having breastplates of fire and jacinth and brimstone; and the heads of the horses were as heads of lions, and out of their mouths goes out fire and smoke and brimstone."
Revelation,9,18,"By these three plagues were the third part of men killed, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which goes out of their mouths."
Revelation,9,19,"For the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails: for their tails are like serpents, having heads, and with them they injure."
Revelation,9,20,"And the rest of men who were not killed with these plagues repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and the golden and silver and brazen and stone and wooden idols, which can neither see nor hear nor walk."
Revelation,9,21,"And they repented not of their murders, nor of their witchcrafts, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts."
Revelation,10,1,"And I saw another strong angel coming down out of the heaven, clothed with a cloud, and the rainbow upon his head, and his countenance as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire"
Revelation,10,2,"and having in his hand a little opened book. And he set his right foot on the sea, and the left upon the earth"
Revelation,10,3,"and cried with a loud voice as a lion roars. And when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their own voices."
Revelation,10,4,"And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write: and I heard a voice out of the heaven saying, Seal the things which the seven thunders have spoken, and write them not."
Revelation,10,5,And the angel whom I saw stand on the sea and on the earth lifted up his right hand to the heaven
Revelation,10,6,"and swore by him that lives to the ages of ages, who created the heaven and the things that are in it, and the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there should be no longer delay"
Revelation,10,7,"but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound the trumpet, the mystery of God also shall be completed, as he has made known the glad tidings to his own bondmen the prophets."
Revelation,10,8,"And the voice which I heard out of the heaven was again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the little book which is opened in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the earth."
Revelation,10,9,"And I went to the angel, saying to him to give me the little book. And he says to me, Take and eat it up: and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey."
Revelation,10,10,"And I took the little book out of the hand of the angel, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth as honey, sweet; and when I had eaten it my belly was made bitter."
Revelation,10,11,"And it was said to me, Thou must prophesy again as to peoples and nations and tongues and many kings."
Revelation,11,1,"And there was given to me a reed like a staff, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship in it."
Revelation,11,2,"And the court which is without the temple cast out, and measure it not; because it has been given up to the nations, and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty-two months."
Revelation,11,3,"And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth."
Revelation,11,4,These are the two olive trees and the two lamps which stand before the Lord of the earth
Revelation,11,5,"and if any one wills to injure them, fire goes out of their mouth, and devours their enemies. And if any one wills to injure them, thus must he be killed."
Revelation,11,6,"These have power to shut the heaven that no rain may fall during the days of their prophecy; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth as often as they will with every plague."
Revelation,11,7,"And when they shall have completed their testimony, the beast who comes up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and shall conquer them, and shall kill them"
Revelation,11,8,"and their body shall be on the street of the great city, which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified."
Revelation,11,9,"And men of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations see their body three days and a half, and they do not suffer their bodies to be put into a sepulchre."
Revelation,11,10,"And they that dwell upon the earth rejoice over them, and are full of delight, and shall send gifts one to another, because these, the two prophets, tormented them that dwell upon the earth."
Revelation,11,11,"And after the three days and a half the spirit of life from God came into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon those beholding them."
Revelation,11,12,"And I heard a great voice out of the heaven saying to them, Come up here; and they went up to the heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them."
