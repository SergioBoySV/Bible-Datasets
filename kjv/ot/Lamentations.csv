Lamentations,1,1,"How doth the city sit solitary,
That was full of people!
How is she become as a widow!
She that was great among the nations,
And princess among the provinces,
How is she become tributary!"
Lamentations,1,2,"She weepeth sore in the night,
And her tears are on her cheeks:
Among all her lovers
She hath none to comfort her:
All her friends have dealt treacherously with her,
They are become her enemies."
Lamentations,1,3,"Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction,
And because of great servitude:
She dwelleth among the heathen,
She findeth no rest:
All her persecutors overtook her
Between the straits."
Lamentations,1,4,"The ways of Zion do mourn,
Because none come to the solemn feasts:
All her gates are desolate:
Her priests sigh,
Her virgins are afflicted,
And she is in bitterness."
Lamentations,1,5,"Her adversaries are the chief,
Her enemies prosper;
For the LORD hath afflicted her
For the multitude of her transgressions:
Her children are gone
Into captivity before the enemy."
Lamentations,1,6,"And from the daughter of Zion
All her beauty is departed:
Her princes are become like harts
That find no pasture,
And they are gone without strength
Before the pursuer."
Lamentations,1,7,"Jerusalem remembered
In the days of her affliction and of her miseries
All her pleasant things
That she had in the days of old,
When her people fell into the hand of the enemy,
And none did help her:
The adversaries saw her,
And did mock at her sabbaths."
Lamentations,1,8,"Jerusalem hath grievously sinned;
Therefore she is removed:
All that honoured her despise her,
Because they have seen her nakedness:
Yea, she sigheth,
And turneth backward."
Lamentations,1,9,"Her filthiness is in her skirts;
She remembereth not her last end;
Therefore she came down wonderfully:
She had no comforter.
O LORD, behold my affliction:
For the enemy hath magnified himself."
Lamentations,1,10,"The adversary hath spread out his hand
Upon all her pleasant things:
For she hath seen that the heathen
Entered into her sanctuary,
Whom thou didst command
That they should not enter into thy congregation."
Lamentations,1,11,"All her people sigh,
They seek bread;
They have given their pleasant things
For meat to relieve the soul:
See, O LORD, and consider;
For I am become vile."
Lamentations,1,12,"Is it nothing to you,
All ye that pass by?
Behold, and see if there be any sorrow
Like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me,
Wherewith the LORD hath afflicted
Me in the day of his fierce anger."
Lamentations,1,13,"From above hath he sent fire into my bones,
And it prevaileth against them:
He hath spread a net for my feet,
He hath turned me back:
He hath made me desolate
And faint all the day."
Lamentations,1,14,"The yoke of my transgressions is bound
By his hand:
They are wreathed, and come up upon my neck:
He hath made my strength to fall,
The Lord hath delivered me into their hands,
From whom I am not able to rise up."
Lamentations,1,15,"The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men
In the midst of me:
He hath called an assembly against me
To crush my young men:
The Lord hath trodden the virgin,
The daughter of Judah, as in a winepress."
Lamentations,1,16,"For these things I weep;
Mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water,
Because the comforter that should relieve my
Soul is far from me:
My children are desolate,
Because the enemy prevailed."
Lamentations,1,17,"Zion spreadeth forth her hands,
And there is none to comfort her:
The LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob,
That his adversaries should be round about him:
Jerusalem is as
A menstruous woman among them."
Lamentations,1,18,"The LORD is righteous;
For I have rebelled against his commandment:
Hear, I pray you, all people,
And behold my sorrow:
My virgins and my young men
Are gone into captivity."
Lamentations,1,19,"I called for my lovers,
But they deceived me:
My priests and mine elders
Gave up the ghost in the city,
While they sought their meat
To relieve their souls."
Lamentations,1,20,"Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress:
My bowels are troubled;
Mine heart is turned within me;
For I have grievously rebelled:
Abroad the sword bereaveth,
At home there is as death."
Lamentations,1,21,"They have heard that I sigh:
There is none to comfort me:
All mine enemies have heard of my trouble;
They are glad that thou hast done it:
Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called,
And they shall be like unto me."
Lamentations,1,22,"Let all their wickedness come before thee;
And do unto them,
As thou hast done unto me
For all my transgressions:
For my sighs are many,
And my heart is faint."
Lamentations,2,1,"How hath the Lord covered
The daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger,
And cast down from heaven unto the earth
The beauty of Israel,
And remembered not his footstool
In the day of his anger!"
Lamentations,2,2,"The Lord hath swallowed up
All the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied:
He hath thrown down in his wrath
The strong holds of the daughter of Judah;
He hath brought them down to the ground:
He hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof."
Lamentations,2,3,"He hath cut off in his fierce anger
All the horn of Israel:
He hath drawn back his right hand
From before the enemy,
And he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire,
Which devoureth round about."
Lamentations,2,4,"He hath bent his bow like an enemy:
He stood with his right hand as an adversary,
And slew all that were pleasant to the eye
In the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion:
He poured out his fury like fire."
Lamentations,2,5,"The Lord was as an enemy:
He hath swallowed up Israel,
He hath swallowed up all her palaces:
He hath destroyed his strong holds,
And hath increased in the daughter of Judah
Mourning and lamentation."
Lamentations,2,6,"And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden:
He hath destroyed his places of the assembly:
The LORD hath caused the solemn feasts
And sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion,
And hath despised in the indignation of his anger
The king and the priest."
Lamentations,2,7,"The Lord hath cast off his altar,
He hath abhorred his sanctuary,
He hath given up into the hand of the enemy
The walls of her palaces;
They have made a noise in the house of the LORD,
As in the day of a solemn feast."
Lamentations,2,8,"The LORD hath purposed to destroy
The wall of the daughter of Zion:
He hath stretched out a line,
He hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying:
Therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament;
They languished together."
Lamentations,2,9,"Her gates are sunk into the ground;
He hath destroyed and broken her bars:
Her king and her princes are among the Gentiles:
The law is no more;
Her prophets also find
No vision from the LORD."
Lamentations,2,10,"The elders of the daughter of Zion
Sit upon the ground, and keep silence:
They have cast up dust upon their heads;
They have girded themselves with sackcloth:
The virgins of Jerusalem
Hang down their heads to the ground."
Lamentations,2,11,"Mine eyes do fail with tears,
My bowels are troubled,
My liver is poured upon the earth,
For the destruction of the daughter of my people;
Because the children and the sucklings swoon
In the streets of the city."
Lamentations,2,12,"They say to their mothers,
Where is corn and wine?
When they swooned as the wounded
In the streets of the city,
When their soul was poured out
Into their mothers' bosom."
Lamentations,2,13,"What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee,
O daughter of Jerusalem?
What shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee,
O virgin daughter of Zion?
For thy breach is great like the sea:
Who can heal thee?"
Lamentations,2,14,"Thy prophets have seen vain
And foolish things for thee:
And they have not discovered thine iniquity,
To turn away thy captivity;
But have seen for thee false burdens
And causes of banishment."
Lamentations,2,15,"All that pass by clap
Their hands at thee;
They hiss and wag their head
At the daughter of Jerusalem, saying,
Is this the city that men call
The perfection of beauty,
The joy of the whole earth?"
Lamentations,2,16,"All thine enemies
Have opened their mouth against thee:
They hiss and gnash the teeth:
They say, We have swallowed her up:
Certainly this is the day that we looked for;
We have found, we have seen it."
Lamentations,2,17,"The LORD hath done that which he had devised;
He hath fulfilled his word
That he had commanded in the days of old:
He hath thrown down, and hath not pitied:
And he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee,
He hath set up the horn of thine adversaries."
Lamentations,2,18,"Their heart cried unto the Lord,
O wall of the daughter of Zion,
Let tears run down like a river
Day and night:
Give thyself no rest;
Let not the apple of thine eye cease."
Lamentations,2,19,"Arise, cry out in the night:
In the beginning of the watches
Pour out thine heart like water
Before the face of the Lord:
Lift up thy hands toward him for the life
Of thy young children,
That faint for hunger
In the top of every street."
Lamentations,2,20,"Behold, O LORD,
And consider to whom thou hast done this.
Shall the women eat their fruit,
And children of a span long?
Shall the priest and the prophet be slain
In the sanctuary of the Lord?"
Lamentations,2,21,"The young and the old lie
On the ground in the streets:
My virgins and my young men
Are fallen by the sword;
Thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger;
Thou hast killed, and not pitied."
Lamentations,2,22,"Thou hast called as in a solemn day
My terrors round about,
So that in the day of the LORD's anger
None escaped nor remained:
Those that I have swaddled and brought up hath
Mine enemy consumed."
Lamentations,3,1,"I am the man that hath seen affliction
By the rod of his wrath."
Lamentations,3,2,"He hath led me, and brought me
Into darkness, but not into light."

Against me all the day."

And compassed me with gall and travail."

As they that be dead of old."

He shutteth out my prayer."

He hath made my paths crooked."

And as a lion in secret places."

He hath made me desolate."

As a mark for the arrow."

To enter into my reins."
Lamentations,3,14,"I was a derision to all my people;
And their song all the day."

He hath made me drunken with wormwood."

He hath covered me with ashes."
Lamentations,3,17,"And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace:
I forgat prosperity."
Lamentations,3,18,"And I said, My strength and my hope
Is perished from the LORD"
Lamentations,3,19,"Remembering mine affliction and my misery,
The wormwood and the gall."

And is humbled in me."

Therefore have I hope."

Wait for the salvation of the LORD."

The yoke in his youth."

Because he hath borne it upon him."
Lamentations,3,29,"He putteth his mouth in the dust;
If so be there may be hope."
Lamentations,3,30,"He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him:
He is filled full with reproach."
Lamentations,3,31,"For the Lord will not
Cast off for ever"
Lamentations,3,32,"But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion
According to the multitude of his mercies."
Lamentations,3,33,"For he doth not afflict willingly
Nor grieve the children of men."
Lamentations,3,34,"To crush under his feet
All the prisoners of the earth"
Lamentations,3,35,"To turn aside the right of a man
Before the face of the Most High"

The Lord approveth not."

When the Lord commandeth it not?"

Proceedeth not evil and good?"
