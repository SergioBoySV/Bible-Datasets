O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
As the tents of Kedar,
As the curtains of Solomon."

Because the sun hath looked upon me:
My mother's children were angry with me;
They made me the keeper of the vineyards;
But mine own vineyard have I not kept."

Where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon:

And the voice of the turtle
Is heard in our land"

And the vines with the tender grape
Give a good smell.
Arise, my love, my fair one,
and come away."

In the secret places of the stairs,
Let me see thy countenance,
Let me hear thy voice;
For sweet is thy voice,
And thy countenance is comely."

The little foxes,
That spoil the vines:
For our vines have tender grapes."

To whom I said,
Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?"

Until I had brought him into my mother's house,
And into the chamber of her that conceived me."

By the roes, and by the hinds of the field,
That ye stir not up, nor awake my love,
Till he please."

Like pillars of smoke,
Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,
With all powders of the merchant?"

Of the valiant of Israel."

Being expert in war:
Every man hath his sword upon his thigh
Because of fear in the night."

From the top of Shenir and Hermon,
From the lions' dens,
From the mountains of the leopards."

And come, thou south;
Blow upon my garden,
That the spices thereof may flow out.
Let my beloved come into his garden,
And eat his pleasant fruits."

I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;
I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;
I have drunk my wine with my milk:
Eat, O friends;
Drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved."
Song of Songs,5,2,"I sleep, but my heart waketh:
It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying,
Open to me, my sister, my love,
My dove, my undefiled:
For my head is filled with dew,
And my locks with the drops of the night."

How shall I put it on?
I have washed my feet;
How shall I defile them?"

And my bowels were moved for him."

And my hands dropped with myrrh,
And my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh,
Upon the handles of the lock."

But my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone:
My soul failed when he spake:
I sought him, but I could not find him;
I called him, but he gave me no answer."

For they have overcome me:
Thy hair is as a flock of goats
That appear from Gilead."

Which go up from the washing,
Whereof every one beareth twins,
And there is not one barren among them."

Within thy locks."

Yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her."
Song of Songs,6,10,"Who is she that looketh forth as the morning,
Fair as the moon, clear as the sun,
And terrible as an army with banners?"

To see the fruits of the valley,
And to see whether the vine flourished,
And the pomegranates budded."

My soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib."

Return, return, that we may look upon thee.
What will ye see in the Shulamite?
As it were the company of two armies."

O prince's daughter!

The work of the hands of a cunning workman."

Which wanteth not liquor:
Thy belly is like an heap of wheat
Set about with lilies."

That are twins."

Thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon,
By the gate of Bathrabbim:
Thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon
Which looketh toward Damascus."
Song of Songs,7,5,"Thine head upon thee is like Carmel,
And the hair of thine head like purple;
The king is held in the galleries."
Song of Songs,7,6,"How fair and how pleasant art thou,
O love, for delights!"
Song of Songs,7,7,"This thy stature is like to a palm tree,
And thy breasts to clusters of grapes."
Song of Songs,7,8,"I said, I will go up to the palm tree,
I will take hold of the boughs thereof:
Now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine,
And the smell of thy nose like apples"
Song of Songs,7,9,"And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine
For my beloved, that goeth down sweetly,
Causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak."

And his desire is toward me."
Song of Songs,7,11,"Come, my beloved,
Let us go forth into the field;
Let us lodge in the villages."

Let us see if the vine flourish,
Whether the tender grape appear,
And the pomegranates bud forth:
There will I give thee my loves."

And at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits,
New and old,
Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved."

That sucked the breasts of my mother!
When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee;
Yea, I should not be despised."

And bring thee into my mother's house,
Who would instruct me:

Of the juice of my pomegranate."

And his right hand should embrace me."

That ye stir not up, nor awake my love,
Until he please."

Leaning upon her beloved?
I raised thee up under the apple tree:
There thy mother brought thee forth:
There she brought thee forth that bare thee."
Song of Songs,8,6,"Set me as a seal upon thine heart,
As a seal upon thine arm:
For love is strong as death;
Jealousy is cruel as the grave:
The coals thereof are coals of fire,
Which hath a most vehement flame."
Song of Songs,8,7,"Many waters cannot quench love,
Neither can the floods drown it:
If a man would give all the substance of his house for love,
It would utterly be contemned."
Song of Songs,8,8,"We have a little sister,
And she hath no breasts:
What shall we do for our sister
In the day when she shall be spoken for?"

We will build upon her a palace of silver:
And if she be a door,
We will inclose her with boards of cedar."

And my breasts like towers:
Then was I in his eyes
As one that found favour."

He let out the vineyard unto keepers;
Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver."

Thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand,
And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred."
Song of Songs,8,13,"Thou that dwellest in the gardens,
The companions hearken to thy voice:
Cause me to hear it."
Song of Songs,8,14,"Make haste, my beloved,
And be thou like to a roe
Or to a young hart
Upon the mountains of spices."
