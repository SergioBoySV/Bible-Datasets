Isaiah,1,1,"This is the vision that Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw about Judah and Jerusalem in the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah."
Isaiah,1,2,"Heavens, listen! Earth, pay attention! For the Lord has spoken! I brought up children, I cared for them, but they have rebelled against me."
Isaiah,1,3,"An ox knows its owner, and a donkey knows its feeding trough; but my people don't know me, they don't understand me."
Isaiah,1,4,"What a sinful nation—a people carrying such a load of guilt, an evil generation, corrupt children! They have abandoned the Lord. They have despised Israel's Holy One. They have become strangers. They have gone backwards."
Isaiah,1,5,"Are you wanting to be punished? Are you going to continue to rebel? The whole of your head is damaged, and your heart is totally giving out."
Isaiah,1,6,"You're injured from head to toe, bruised and sore, with open wounds that haven't been cleaned or bandaged or treated with olive oil."
Isaiah,1,7,"Your country has been devastated, your towns burned down, your fields stripped bare by foreigners right in front of you, as they turn it all into a wasteland."
Isaiah,1,8,"The daughter of Zion is left like a shack in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a city under attack."
Isaiah,1,9,"If the Lord Almighty hadn't let a few of us survive, we would have become like Sodom and Gomorrah."
Isaiah,1,10,"Listen to what the Lord has to say, you rulers of Sodom! Pay attention to the instructions of our God, you people of Gomorrah!"
Isaiah,1,11,What use are all your many sacrifices to me? asks the Lord. I am sick and tired of your burnt offerings of rams and the fat of sacrificial animals. I don't delight in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats!
Isaiah,1,12,"When you come to appear before me in worship, who asked you to proudly tramp around my courts?"
Isaiah,1,13,"Don't bring me any more meaningless offerings; your incense is offensive to me. Your new moon festivals and Sabbath observations and your calling of special religious meetings—I can't stand them because they're evil, as are your solemn assemblies."
Isaiah,1,14,I detest your new moon and yearly festivals with my whole being! They've become just a burden to me—I can't bear them anymore!
Isaiah,1,15,"When you hold up your hands to me in prayer, I'll look away. Even though you pray many prayers, I won't pay attention to them, because your hands are full of blood."
Isaiah,1,16,Wash yourselves and clean yourselves up. Get rid of your sins—I don't want to see them! Stop doing evil!
Isaiah,1,17,"Learn to do good; strive for justice, condemn those who oppress others; support the rights of orphans, take up cases to defend widows."
Isaiah,1,18,"Come on, let's argue this out, says the Lord. Even though your sins are like scarlet, they will become white like snow. Even though they are red like crimson, they will become like wool."
Isaiah,1,19,"If you really want this, and if you do as you're told, then you yourselves will eat the best things that the land produces."
Isaiah,1,20,"But if you are defiant, and if you are rebellious, you'll be killed by the sword. This is what the Lord has declared!"
Isaiah,1,21,"The city that used to be faithful has turned into a prostitute! Once she operated on principles of justice and followed what was right, but now only murderers live there."
Isaiah,1,22,Your silver has become worthless waste; your wine has been watered down.
Isaiah,1,23,"Your leaders are rebels, friends of thieves. They all love bribes and want to get kickbacks. They don't defend the rights of orphans, and refuse to take cases to help widows."
Isaiah,1,24,"So this is what the Lord says, the Lord Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel: Ha! I will take satisfaction in punishing my enemies, by paying back those who hate me!"
Isaiah,1,25,"I will turn against you. I will refine you in a furnace, removing all impurities."
Isaiah,1,26,"I will give you good leaders as you used to have before, wise counselors as you had in the beginning. After that you will once again be called the City of Integrity, the Faithful City."
Isaiah,1,27,"Zion will be rescued by justice, those who repent by doing right."
Isaiah,1,28,"But rebels and sinners will be destroyed together, and those who abandon the Lord will die."
Isaiah,1,29,You will be ashamed about how you enjoyed your pagan worship among the oak trees; you will be embarrassed because you chose the pleasure gardens of idols.
Isaiah,1,30,"As a result you will become like an oak whose leaves have withered, a dried-out garden that has no water."
Isaiah,1,31,"Your strong people will become like tinder, and their work will become like a spark. They will burn together, and nobody will be able to put out the flames."
Isaiah,2,1,"This is the vision that Isaiah, son of Amoz, saw about Judah and Jerusalem."
Isaiah,2,2,"In the last days the mountain where the Lord's Temple stands will be recognized as the highest of all mountains, rising above other hills. Many from the other nations will travel to it."
Isaiah,2,3,"People will come and say, “Let's go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the Temple of the God of Jacob. There God will teach us his ways and we will follow his directions. God's teachings will spread out from Zion, his word from Jerusalem.”"
Isaiah,2,4,"The Lord will decide the cases of the nations; he will settle arguments between nations. They will hammer their swords and turn them into plow blades, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nations will not fight against each other anymore; they will no longer learn methods of warfare."
Isaiah,2,5,"Come, you Israelites, let's walk in the Lord's light."
Isaiah,2,6,"For you, Lord, have given up on your people the Israelites, because they have adopted pagan practices from the East, they use spells like the Philistines, and make friends with foreigners."
Isaiah,2,7,"Their country is full of silver and gold, and endless wealth. Their land is full of horses; and they have an endless amount of chariots."
Isaiah,2,8,Their country is full of idols; they bow down and worship what they have made themselves—produced by their own hands!
Isaiah,2,9,"These people will be brought down and humiliated—Lord, don't forgive them!"
Isaiah,2,10,"Run away into rock caves, hide underground from the terrifying presence of the Lord, from the glory of his majesty."
Isaiah,2,11,Those who look with arrogance will be brought low; those who are proud will be humbled. On that day only the Lord will be lifted high.
Isaiah,2,12,"The Lord has set aside a day when he will deal with the proud and arrogant. He will end all self-glorification, bringing it down."
Isaiah,2,13,"He will cut down the cedars of Lebanon, tall and high, and all the great oaks of Bashan"

Isaiah,2,15,He will tear down every high tower and every defensive wall.
Isaiah,2,16,He will wipe out all the commercial ships of Tarshish as well as the pleasure vessels.
Isaiah,2,17,The arrogant will be humbled; the proud will be brought low. On that day only the Lord will be lifted high.
Isaiah,2,18,Idols will completely vanish away.
Isaiah,2,19,"People will run away into rock caves and holes in the ground to try and hide from the terrifying presence of the Lord, from the glory of his majesty, when he arrives to shake the earth."
Isaiah,2,20,On that day the people will take the idols of silver and gold that they made to worship and throw them away to the rats and the bats.
Isaiah,2,21,"They will run to cracks in the rocks and gaps on the cliffs to try and hide from the terrifying presence of the Lord, from the glory of his majesty, when he arrives to shake the earth."
Isaiah,2,22,Don't bother trusting human beings who only live for a while. How much do they count?
Isaiah,3,1,"Take a look! The Lord, the Lord Almighty, is going to take away from Jerusalem and from Judah everything they rely on—all their stocks of food and all means of supplying water"
Isaiah,3,2,"their strong fighters and soldiers, leaders and prophets, fortune-tellers and elders"
Isaiah,3,3,"army captains, state officials, counselors, craftsmen, masters of magic, and experts in the occult."
Isaiah,3,4,I will give them boys as their leaders who will rule over them in childish ways.
Isaiah,3,5,"People will mistreat one another, person against person, neighbor against neighbor; the young will assault the old, and the dregs of society will attack those who are reputable."
Isaiah,3,6,"A man will grab hold of one of his brothers in their father's house, and tell him, “You've got a coat, you can be our leader! Take over the running of this pile of ruins!”"
Isaiah,3,7,"But immediately his brother will shout back, “No, not me! I can't take care of this family's problems. In my house I don't have food or clothes. Don't put me in charge as your leader!”"
Isaiah,3,8,"For Jerusalem has collapsed and Judah has fallen because of what they said and did in opposition to the Lord, rebelling right in front of him."
Isaiah,3,9,"The look on their faces proves what they've done, proclaiming their sin just like Sodom—they don't even bother to try and hide it! Tragedy is coming to them! They have brought disaster down upon themselves."
Isaiah,3,10,"Tell those who live right that they will be fine, for they will be happy to receive the reward for what they have done."
Isaiah,3,11,"But tragedy comes to the wicked, for what they did will be done to them."
Isaiah,3,12,"Leaders who act in childish ways mistreat my people; women rule over them. My people, your leaders are misleading you, confusing you about which way to go."
Isaiah,3,13,The Lord stands up to prosecute his case. The Lord stands up to judge the people.
Isaiah,3,14,The Lord comes to give his judgment against the elders and leaders of his people: You are the ones who have destroyed my vineyard; your houses are full with everything you've stolen from the poor.
Isaiah,3,15,Why have you crushed my people? Why have you ground the faces of the poor into the dirt? the Lord Almighty demands to know.
Isaiah,3,16,"The Lord says, The women of Zion are so conceited, walking with their heads held high, giving flirty glances, tripping along with their ankle bracelets jingling."
Isaiah,3,17,"So the Lord will make their heads full of scabs, and the Lord will expose their private parts."
Isaiah,3,18,"At that time the Lord will remove their fine ornaments: ankle bracelets, headbands, crescent necklaces"
Isaiah,3,19,"pendant earrings, bracelets, veils"
Isaiah,3,20,"headdresses, bangles, sashes, perfume holders, lucky charms"
Isaiah,3,21,"rings, nose rings"
Isaiah,3,22,"festival clothes, gowns, cloaks, handbags"
Isaiah,3,23,"hand mirrors, fine linen underwear, head wraps, and shawls."
Isaiah,3,24,"What will happen is that instead of smelling of perfume, she will stink. Instead of a wearing a sash, she will be tied with a rope. Instead of styled hair, she will be bald. Instead of fine clothes, she will wear sackcloth. Instead of looking beautiful, she will be shamed."
Isaiah,3,25,Your men will be killed by the sword; your soldiers will die in battle.
Isaiah,3,26,The gates of Zion will cry and mourn. The city will be like a banished woman sitting on the ground.
Isaiah,4,1,"At that time seven women will grab hold of one man and tell him, “We'll eat our own food and we can provide our own clothes. Just let us take your name by being married to you. Please take away our disgrace!”"
Isaiah,4,2,"But at that time, the “branch of the Lord” will be attractive and glorious; the fruit the land produces will be the pride and glory of the survivors who are left in Israel."
Isaiah,4,3,Everyone who remains in Zion will be called holy—all of those who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem
Isaiah,4,4,"once the Lord has washed away the excrement of the daughters of Zion, and cleaned the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire."
Isaiah,4,5,Then the Lord will create over the whole of Mount Zion and over the assembly of those who meet there a cloud of smoke during the day and a blazing flame of fire during night—over everything there will be this glorious canopy.
Isaiah,4,6,"It will provide a place to stay in the shade of the daytime heat, and a shelter to hide from storm and rain."
Isaiah,5,1,"Let me sing a song for my love, about his vineyard. My love owned a vineyard on a productive hill."
Isaiah,5,2,"He dug it over, cleared the ground of stones, and planted it with the very best vines. In the middle of it he built a watchtower, and he also cut out a winepress from the rock. Then he waited for a good harvest of grapes, but it only produced wild, sour grapes."
Isaiah,5,3,"“Now, you people who live in Jerusalem and Judah, please judge between me and my vineyard."
Isaiah,5,4,"What more could I have done for my vineyard than I've already done? When I looked for sweet grapes, why did it only produce sour ones?"
Isaiah,5,5,"So let me tell you what I'm going to do to my vineyard. I'll remove its hedge, and it will be destroyed. I'll tear down its wall, and it will be trampled underfoot."
Isaiah,5,6,I'll turn it into a wasteland. It won't be pruned or weeded—it will be overgrown with brambles and thorns. I'll order the clouds not to rain on it.”
Isaiah,5,7,"Israel is the vineyard of the Lord Almighty, and the people of Judah are the plants in his garden that made him happy. Yet while he hoped for justice, he only saw injustice; he hoped people would live right, but he only heard the cries of those who were suffering."
Isaiah,5,8,"Tragedy is coming to you who buy house upon house and field upon field, joining them all together until no one else has anywhere to live and you live alone in the land."
Isaiah,5,9,"I heard the Lord Almighty declare: You can be sure that many houses are destined to become ruins, and beautiful mansions destined to become uninhabited."
Isaiah,5,10,"Ten acres of vineyard will only produce six gallons of wine, and a measure of seed only a tenth of that in grain."
Isaiah,5,11,"Tragedy is coming to you who get up early in the morning wanting a drink, and who stay up late drinking wine until you're drunk."
Isaiah,5,12,"At their feasts you have lyres and harps, tambourines and flutes, and wine, but you don't ever consider what the Lord is doing, and you don't recognize his help."
Isaiah,5,13,"As a result my people will be exiled for their lack of understanding. Their honored leaders will starve, and the crowds will be dying of thirst."
Isaiah,5,14,"The grave's appetite increases, its mouth opens wide, and Jerusalem's nobility and the masses will go down into it, along with the rowdy, drunken mobs."
Isaiah,5,15,"Everyone will be brought down, everyone will be humbled; the proud will lower their eyes in humiliation."
Isaiah,5,16,But the Lord Almighty will be vindicated because he does what is right; the holy God will be shown to be holy because of his goodness.
Isaiah,5,17,Lambs will graze as in their own pasture; fattened livestock and goats will feed among the ruins of the rich.
Isaiah,5,18,"Tragedy is coming to you who drag along your sins behind you with cords made of lies, pulling with ropes your cartful of wickedness."
Isaiah,5,19,"You are among the people who say, “God should hurry up! Why doesn't God get a move on with what he's doing so we can see it? Why doesn't the Holy One of Israel execute his plan? Let's see it happen so we can understand what it is!”"
Isaiah,5,20,"Tragedy is coming to you who say evil is good, and good is evil; who turn darkness into light and light into darkness; who make bitter sweet, and sweet bitter."
Isaiah,5,21,Tragedy is coming to you who are wise in your own eyes and think you're so clever.
Isaiah,5,22,"Tragedy is coming to you who are wine-drinking champions, and experts at mixing alcoholic drinks"
Isaiah,5,23,"you who set the guilty free for a bribe, and yet deny justice to the innocent."
Isaiah,5,24,"In the same way fire burns up stubble and dry grass falls down in the flames, so their roots will decay and their flowers disintegrate into dust. For they have rejected the law of the Lord Almighty, and have treated with contempt what the Holy One of Israel has said."
Isaiah,5,25,"That's why the Lord burns with anger against his people. He has lifted up his hand and hit them, shaking the mountains, and leaving their corpses lying like refuse in the streets. Despite all this, his anger is not finished, and his hand is still lifted up."
Isaiah,5,26,"He will send a signal to the distant nations, and will whistle for those living at the ends of the earth. See how quickly they respond, how speedily they come!"
Isaiah,5,27,"None of them gets tired or stumbles; none of them rests or sleeps. No belt comes loose, and no sandal strap breaks."
Isaiah,5,28,"Their arrows are already sharpened, and all their bows have been strung. The hooves of their horses are hard as flint; their chariot wheels spin like a whirlwind."
Isaiah,5,29,"They roar like lions, like young lions. They growl, and pounce on their prey. They drag it off so it can't be rescued."
Isaiah,5,30,At that time they will roar over their prey like the roaring of the sea. Anyone who looks out over the land will see only darkness and distress—even the sunlight will be darkened by clouds.
Isaiah,6,1,"In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated in majesty on a high throne, and the train of his robe filled the Temple."
Isaiah,6,2,"Seraphim stood above him, and each of them had six wings: They used two wings to cover their faces, two to cover their feet, and two to fly."
Isaiah,6,3,"They were calling out to one another: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty; his glory fills the whole earth."
Isaiah,6,4,"The sound of their shouts made the doorposts and doorsteps shake, and the Temple was filled with smoke."
Isaiah,6,5,"I cried out, “I'm doomed! I'm going to die because I'm a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, for I've seen the King, the Lord Almighty!”"
Isaiah,6,6,Then one of the seraphim flew over to me. He was holding a glowing coal that he had picked up with tongs from the altar.
Isaiah,6,7,"He touched me on my mouth with it and told me, “Look! This has touched your lips, so now your guilt is taken away and your sin is forgiven.”"
Isaiah,6,8,"Then I heard the Lord asking, “Who shall I send? Who will go and speak for us?” So I said, “I'm here! Please send me!”"
Isaiah,6,9,"He replied, “Go and tell this people: ‘Keep on listening, but never understanding. Keep on seeing, but never comprehending.’"
Isaiah,6,10,"Make the minds of this people insensitive; make their ears deaf and shut their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their minds, and repent and be healed.”"
Isaiah,6,11,"Then I asked, “How long will this last, Lord?”
He replied, “Until towns are ruined and empty, houses are abandoned, and the land is devastated and destroyed"
Isaiah,6,12,until the Lord sends the people far away and the country is totally deserted.
Isaiah,6,13,"Even though a tenth of the population remains in the land, it will be destroyed again. But in the same way as the terebinth and oak trees leave stumps when they're cut down, so the holy seed will remain as a stump.”"
Isaiah,7,1,"It was during the reign of Ahaz son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin, king of Aram, marched to attack Jerusalem. Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, joined in the attack, but they couldn't conquer the city."
Isaiah,7,2,"When the royal family of Judah was told, “Aram and Ephraim have an alliance,” Ahaz and his people were terrified and they shook like trees in the forest tossed about by the wind."
Isaiah,7,3,"Then the Lord told Isaiah, “Take your son Shear-jashub with you and go and meet Ahaz. He'll be at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool, by the road to the laundry field."
Isaiah,7,4,"Tell him, ‘Calm down and keep quiet. Don't be afraid or scared over a couple of smoldering bits of firewood, over the burning anger of Rezin and Aram, and of Remaliah's son."
Isaiah,7,5,Aram has plotted to destroy you together with Ephraim and Remaliah's son saying
Isaiah,7,6,"Let's go and attack Judah! We'll terrorize it and conquer it for ourselves, and make Tabeel's son its king.’”"
Isaiah,7,7,"But this is what the Lord God says, “This plan won't materialize—it just won't happen!"
Isaiah,7,8,"For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. In addition, within sixty-five years Israel as a nation will be destroyed."
Isaiah,7,9,"The head of Israel is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If you don't trust in me, then you won't survive.”"
Isaiah,7,10,Later the Lord sent another message to Ahaz
Isaiah,7,11,"“Ask the Lord your God for a sign, whether as deep as where people are buried or as high as heaven.”"
Isaiah,7,12,"“No, I'm not going to ask,” Ahaz replied. “I refuse to put the Lord to the test.”"
Isaiah,7,13,"Then Isaiah said, “Listen, royal family of Judah! Isn't it enough for you to wear people out? Do you have to wear my God out too?"
Isaiah,7,14,"This is why the Lord himself is going to give you a sign. Look! The virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and she will call him Immanuel."
Isaiah,7,15,He will eat curds and honey until the time he knows to refuse evil and choose the good.
Isaiah,7,16,"For before the boy knows to refuse evil and choose the good, the land of the two kings you're afraid of will be deserted."
Isaiah,7,17,"The Lord will make you, your people, and the royal family experience a time unlike anything since the day Ephraim split from Judah. He will bring the king of Assyria to attack you!”"
Isaiah,7,18,At that time the Lord will whistle to call flies from the distant rivers of Egypt and bees from the country of Assyria.
Isaiah,7,19,"They will all come and descend on the steep valleys and rock crevices, on all the thorn bushes and waterholes."
Isaiah,7,20,"At that time the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates River, the king of Assyria, to shave you from head to toe, including your beards."
Isaiah,7,21,At that time someone who manages to keep a young cow and two sheep alive
Isaiah,7,22,"will eat curds, because they produce so much milk—for everyone who survives in the land will eat curds and honey."
Isaiah,7,23,At that time everywhere that once had a thousand vines worth a thousand shekels will only have brambles and thorns.
Isaiah,7,24,People will go hunting there with bows and arrows because the land will be covered with brambles and thorns.
Isaiah,7,25,"In fact, all the hills that were once tilled by the hoe you won't want to go to because you'll worry about the brambles and thorns there. They'll just be where cattle are let loose and where sheep roam."
Isaiah,8,1,"Then the Lord told me, “Get a large tablet and write on it in with an ordinary pen, ‘Maher-shalal-hash-baz.’"
Isaiah,8,2,"I will need Uriah the priest and Zechariah, son of Jeberekiah, to be my trustworthy witnesses.”"
Isaiah,8,3,"Then I slept with my wife the prophetess, and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. The Lord told me, “Call him Maher-shalal-hash-baz."
Isaiah,8,4,"For even before the boy knows how to say ‘Daddy’ or ‘Mommy,’ the king of Assyria will carry off Damascus' wealth and Samaria's possessions.”"
Isaiah,8,5,"Then the Lord spoke to me again, saying"
Isaiah,8,6,“Because this people has rejected the waters of Shiloah that gently flow and instead have rejoiced with Rezin and Remaliah's son
Isaiah,8,7,the Lord is going to bring the powerful floodwaters of the Euphrates River against them—the king of Assyria with all his glorious army. It will flood all its channels and overflow all its banks.
Isaiah,8,8,"It will sweep on into Judah, overflowing and flooding through, reaching up to the neck. Like outspread wings it will engulf the whole of your land, Immanuel!"
Isaiah,8,9,"Pay attention, you nations, and be smashed! Listen, all you distant lands, get ready, but you will be smashed. Get ready, but you will be smashed."
Isaiah,8,10,"You can plan your strategy, but it will be foiled; you can say what you're intending, but it won't happen, for God is with us.”"
Isaiah,8,11,"For this is what the Lord told me, holding me with a strong hand, instructing me not to follow the way of this people. He said"
Isaiah,8,12,Don't call a conspiracy everything that these people call a conspiracy. Don't fear what they fear. Don't be overawed!
Isaiah,8,13,"The Lord Almighty is the one you should see as holy. He is the one you should fear, he is the one you should be in awe of."
Isaiah,8,14,"He will be a sanctuary for you. But to the royal families of both Israel and Judah he will be a stone they trip over and a rock that makes them stumble, a trap and a snare to the people who live in Jerusalem."
Isaiah,8,15,Many people will stumble over them. They will fall and be broken. They will be trapped and caught.
Isaiah,8,16,"Safeguard this testimony, seal these instructions—they are for my disciples."
Isaiah,8,17,"I will wait for the Lord, the one who is hiding his face from Jacob's descendants. I will wait in hope for him."
Isaiah,8,18,"Look, I'm here, together with the children the Lord has given me. They are signs and wonders in Israel from the Lord Almighty, who lives on Mount Zion."
Isaiah,8,19,"When someone suggests to you, “Go and ask mediums and spiritists who whisper and mutter,” shouldn't people ask their God? Why should they ask the dead on behalf of the living?"
Isaiah,8,20,"Go and examine God's law and his instructions! If what they say doesn't correspond with God's word, there will be no dawn for them."
Isaiah,8,21,"They will wander around the country, depressed and hungry. When they are starving they will become furious, and looking up they will curse their king and their God."
Isaiah,8,22,"Then they will look towards the earth and see only misery and gloom and agonizing depression, and they will be thrown out into the darkness."
Isaiah,9,1,"Even so, there will be no more darkness for those who suffered. In the past he humiliated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future he will bring honor to Galilee of the foreigners that is on the route that leads from Jordan to the sea."
Isaiah,9,2,People walking in the dark will see a bright light; a light will shine on those living in a land of total darkness.
Isaiah,9,3,"You will make the nation grow enormously, and will make it extremely happy. The people will celebrate before you as people celebrate at harvest-time, as soldiers celebrate when dividing up what has been looted."
Isaiah,9,4,"For you will smash the yoke that burdens them down, the bar across their shoulders, and the oppressors' rod used to beat them just as you did when you defeated the Midianite army."
Isaiah,9,5,"For every army boot that noisily trampled people down, and every uniform soaked in blood—they are going to be burned, fuel for the fire."
Isaiah,9,6,"For a child will be born for us, a son will be given to us. He will bear the responsibility to rule. He will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace."
Isaiah,9,7,"His rule and the peace he brings know no limits and will never come to an end. He will sit on David's throne and rule his kingdom, making it secure. He will operate from principles of justice and goodness, from the time he begins his rule and for all eternity. The Lord Almighty is determined to make this happen."
Isaiah,9,8,"The Lord has sent a message directed against Jacob, and its consequences will fall upon Israel."
Isaiah,9,9,All the people will soon realize it—Ephraim and the people who live in Samaria. Proudly and arrogantly they say
Isaiah,9,10,"“The brick buildings have collapsed, but we will rebuild them with dressed stone; the sycamore fig trees have been cut down, but we will replace them with cedars.”"
Isaiah,9,11,But the Lord has strengthened Rezin's enemies against Israel and has encouraged them.
Isaiah,9,12,Arameans from the east and Philistines from the west have greedily swallowed Israel up. In all of this he is still angry and his hand is still raised.
Isaiah,9,13,But the people didn't return to the one who punished them; they didn't come to worship the Lord Almighty.
Isaiah,9,14,"So in just a single day the Lord will chop off Israel's head and tail, palm branch and reed."
Isaiah,9,15,"Elders and honorable people are the head, and prophets who teach lies are the tail."
Isaiah,9,16,The people's leaders have misled them; those who were guided by them are confused.
Isaiah,9,17,"As a result the Lord isn't pleased with their young men, he has no compassion for their orphans and widows, because all of them are hypocrites and do what's evil—they all talk stupidly. In all of this he is still angry and his hand is still raised."
Isaiah,9,18,"For wickedness blazes like a fire, burning up brambles and thorns, setting the forest on fire, sending a column of smoke swirling upwards."
Isaiah,9,19,"The anger of the Lord Almighty burns the land. People are like fuel for the fire, and nobody tries to help anyone else."
Isaiah,9,20,"People destroy others on the right, yet they're still hungry for more; people destroy others on the left, but they're still not satisfied. In the end they even destroy themselves!"
Isaiah,9,21,"Manasseh destroys Ephraim, and Ephraim destroys Manasseh. Together they turn to destroy Judah. In all of this he is still angry and his hand is still raised."
Isaiah,10,1,Tragedy is coming to those who pass evil decrees and who write laws to harm people.
Isaiah,10,2,"They pervert the legal rights of the needy, and rob justice from the poor of my people. They steal from widows and cheat orphans."
Isaiah,10,3,"What are you going to do on the day you're punished, when disaster falls on you from far away? Who are you going to run to so you can get help? Where are you going to leave all your wealth?"
Isaiah,10,4,"All you'll be able to do is to bow down as prisoners, or lie among the dead! In all of this he is still angry and his hand is still raised."
Isaiah,10,5,"Tragedy is coming to the Assyrians, even though the rod they use represents my anger and the stick they hold in their hands represents my fury!"
Isaiah,10,6,"I am sending the Assyrians against a nation that has given up on its God, against a people that make me angry. I order the Assyrians to loot them, to take their possessions, and to trample them down like mud in the street."
Isaiah,10,7,But this isn't what is behind the thinking of the king of Assyria. This isn't the plan he has in mind. What he wants to do is to destroy and eliminate many nations.
Isaiah,10,8,He says: “All my commanders are kings!

Isaiah,16,10,Joy and happiness are gone. Nobody celebrates in the harvest fields or the vineyards; nobody shouts happily. Nobody treads grapes in the winepresses. I have stopped their cheering.

Isaiah,17,4,At that time the glory of Jacob will fade away; he will lose his strength.

Isaiah,19,10,"The cloth workers will be depressed, and everyone who earns a wage will feel sick inside."
Isaiah,19,11,"The leaders of Zoan are stupid. Pharaoh's wise counselors give advice that doesn't make sense. How can you tell Pharaoh, “I myself am a wise man, descended from ancient kings”?"
Isaiah,19,12,So where are your wise counselors? Let them tell you so you can understand what the Lord Almighty has planned to do to Egypt.

Isaiah,22,5,"For the Lord has a day of defeat, of panic and confusion in the Valley of Vision, a day of tearing down walls and crying for help to the mountains."
Isaiah,22,6,"The Elamites pick up their quivers full of arrows, and prepare their chariots and horsemen, while the people of Kir uncover their shields ready for battle."
Isaiah,22,7,Your most productive valleys are now full of enemy chariots; and their cavalry are at your gates!
Isaiah,22,8,Judah's defenses have been stripped away and so at that time you went looking for weapons in the Palace of the Forest.
Isaiah,22,9,You examined the breaks in the walls of the City of David and found there were many. You had water collect in the lower pool.
Isaiah,22,10,Your reviewed the number of houses in the city and demolished some to provide stone to repair the walls.
Isaiah,22,11,"You built a reservoir inside the walls for the waters from the old pool, but you did not respect its Maker or think about the One who planned it long ago."
Isaiah,22,12,"At that time the Lord, the Lord Almighty, was calling you to weep and mourn, to shave your heads and wear sackcloth."
Isaiah,22,13,"Instead, you go on happily partying! You slaughter cattle and sheep so you can have your feasts, eating meat and drinking wine, saying, “Let's eat and drink, because we're going to die tomorrow!”"
Isaiah,22,14,"The Lord Almighty has made this clear to me: “I will not forgive this sin till your dying day, says the Lord, the Lord Almighty.”"
Isaiah,22,15,"This is what the Lord, the Lord Almighty, told me to do. “Go to Shebna, the palace manager, and give him this message"
Isaiah,22,16,"‘What are you doing here? Who do you think you are, cutting out a tomb for yourself high up on a hill, carving out for yourself a place to rest?"
Isaiah,22,17,"Watch out, you great man! The Lord is about to grab you and violently toss you aside."
Isaiah,22,18,"He's going to roll you up into a ball, and throw you far away into a vast country. You will die there, and that's where the chariots you were so proud of will remain. You're a disgrace to your lord's royal family."
Isaiah,22,19,"I will push you out of office, I will strip you of your position."
Isaiah,22,20,"After that I will call for my servant, Eliakim, son of Hilkiah."
Isaiah,22,21,"I will put your robe and place your sash around him, and I will give your authority to him. He will be a father to the people living in Jerusalem and Judah."
Isaiah,22,22,"I will give him the key to the house of David. What he opens, nobody can shut; what he shuts, nobody can open."
Isaiah,22,23,I will drive him like a nail hammered securely into a wall. He will bring honor to his family.
Isaiah,22,24,"The heavy burden of his father's family will hang on him—all the descendants and the inlaws—all the little containers, bowls and all kinds of jars."
Isaiah,22,25,"So the time will come, declares the Lord Almighty, when the nail will come out of the wall, even though it was hammered in securely. It will break off and fall down, and everything hanging on it will fall down too. The Lord has spoken.’”"
Isaiah,23,1,"A message about Tyre. Howl, people on the ships of Tarshish! Tyre has been destroyed—nothing is left of the houses and the harbor. They heard the news from the people of Cyprus."
Isaiah,23,2,"Stay shocked into silence, people of the coastlands, merchants of Sidon, and sailors."
Isaiah,23,3,Egyptian grain came across the wide oceans. The Nile's harvest was what made Tyre money; she was the merchant to the nations.
Isaiah,23,4,"Feel the shame, Sidon! For the fortress of the sea says, “I have no children, having never been in labor or given birth. I have not brought up young men or brought up young women.”"
Isaiah,23,5,When the news about Tyre reaches Egypt they will be in agony.
Isaiah,23,6,"Sail across to Tarshish! Howl, people of the coastlands!"
Isaiah,23,7,"Is this really your triumphant city, whose beginnings are from the distant past, who has sent out people to colonize faraway places?"
Isaiah,23,8,"Who planned this attack on Tyre? Tyre, who created kingdoms, whose merchants were princes, whose traders were honored around the world!"
Isaiah,23,9,"The Lord Almighty planned it, to humble its pride in all its glory, and to bring down all who receive worldly honor."
Isaiah,23,10,"Work your land, people of Tarshish, as they do beside the Nile, for you don't have a harbor anymore."
Isaiah,23,11,"The Lord held his hand out over the sea and shook kingdoms. He has condemned Phoenicia, giving the order to destroy their fortresses."
Isaiah,23,12,"He said, “Don't celebrate any more, mistreated virgin daughter of Sidon. Go and sail over to Cyprus—however, even there you won't find rest.”"
Isaiah,23,13,"Look at the country of the Babylonians, this people that are not as they used to be! The Assyrians have turned it into a place for desert animals. They set up their siege towers, they demolished the fortresses, and ruined the country."
Isaiah,23,14,"Howl, people on the ships of Tarshish because your fortress is destroyed!"
Isaiah,23,15,"At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, a king's lifetime, as it were. But at the end of these seventy years, Tyre will be like the song about a prostitute"
Isaiah,23,16,"“Take a lyre and walk around the city, forgotten prostitute! Play and sing so people will remember you!”"
Isaiah,23,17,"After seventy years, the Lord will restore Tyre. But then she will go back to hiring herself out as a prostitute, selling herself to all the kingdoms of the world."
Isaiah,23,18,"However, her profits and what she earns will be consecrated to the Lord. They won't be kept or saved up, for her business earnings will go to those who worship the Lord, to provide them with plenty of food and good clothes."
Isaiah,24,1,"Watch out! The Lord is going to destroy the earth, to make it totally devastated. He's going to rip up the surface of the earth and scatter its inhabitants."
Isaiah,24,2,"It will happen the same for everybody—whether people or priests, servants or their masters, maids or their mistresses, buyers or sellers, lenders or borrowers, creditors or debtors."
Isaiah,24,3,The earth will be completely laid waste and looted. This is what the Lord has said.
Isaiah,24,4,"The earth dries up and withers away; the world shrivels up and withers away, the high and mighty people shrivel up along with the earth."
Isaiah,24,5,"The earth is polluted by its people; they have flouted God's laws, violated his regulations, and broken the eternal agreement with him."
Isaiah,24,6,That is why a curse is destroying the earth. The people suffer because of their guilt. The inhabitants of the earth are burned up and only a few survive.
Isaiah,24,7,"The new wine dries up, and the vine withers. All the people celebrating groan."
Isaiah,24,8,The happy sound of tambourines is over; the noise of the party-goers has stopped; the delightful harp music has finished.
Isaiah,24,9,"People don't sing any more as they drink wine, and the beer tastes bitter."
Isaiah,24,10,The chaotic city is falling apart; every house is barred shut to keep others out.
Isaiah,24,11,"Crowds on the street are shouting, demanding to have wine. Joy turns into darkness. There's no happiness left on earth."
Isaiah,24,12,The city is in a horrible state of ruin; its gates have been broken down.
Isaiah,24,13,"This is the way it's going to be all throughout the earth among the nations—only a few olives are left after the tree is shaken, only a few grapes are left to be gleaned after the harvest."
Isaiah,24,14,These survivors shout aloud and sing for joy. From the west they praise the Lord's majesty.
Isaiah,24,15,"From the east they glorify the Lord; from the sea shores they praise the name of the Lord, the God of Israel."
Isaiah,24,16,"We hear songs coming from the ends of the earth, singing, “Glory to the God who does right.”
But I'm miserable, miserable. Pity me! Deceitful people go on betraying, again and again."
Isaiah,24,17,"Terrors and pit-traps and snares are waiting for you, people of the earth."
Isaiah,24,18,"Those who run away in terror will fall into a pit-trap, and those who escape from the pit-trap will be caught in a snare. Heaven's windows are opened; earth's foundations shake."
Isaiah,24,19,"The earth is completely broken up; the earth is ripped apart, the earth is violently shaken."
Isaiah,24,20,"The earth staggers to and fro like a drunk, and sways this way and that like a shelter. The guilt of its rebelliousness weighs heavily on it, and it collapses—it won't rise again."
Isaiah,24,21,At that time the Lord will punish all the high heavenly beings and the kings of the earth.
Isaiah,24,22,"They will be brought together, prisoners in a pit. They will be imprisoned, and eventually they will be punished."
Isaiah,24,23,"The moon will be embarrassed and the sun will be ashamed, for the Lord Almighty will reign in glory on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem in the presence of its leaders."
Isaiah,25,1,"Lord, you are my God. I will honor you and praise who you are, because you have done wonderful things that you planned long ago. You are faithful and trustworthy!"
Isaiah,25,2,You have turned the city into a pile of rubble; the fortified town is now a ruin; the foreigner palace is gone. It is no longer a city and it will never be rebuilt.
Isaiah,25,3,Because of this powerful nations will honor you; cities of brutal nations will be in awe of you.
Isaiah,25,4,"But you have protected the poor and needy when they were in trouble, you shielded them from storms and shaded them from the heat. For the actions of brutal people are like rain beating against a wall"
Isaiah,25,5,"like heat in a desert. You end the noisy uprising of foreigners. In the same way that a cloud's shadow cools down the heat of the day, so the song sung by brutal people is silenced."
Isaiah,25,6,"On this mountain the Lord Almighty will prepare a feast for all nations, a lavish feast of aged wines, rich food, and the best meat."
Isaiah,25,7,"On this mountain he will destroy the veil that covers all the nations, the sheet that is over everyone."
Isaiah,25,8,"He will destroy death forever. The Lord God will wipe away all tears, and everywhere he will take away the humiliation suffered by his people. The Lord has spoken."
Isaiah,25,9,"At that time his people will say, “Look! This is our God; we have trusted in him and he has saved us! This is the Lord we have been looking for. Now we can be happy and celebrate the salvation he brings!”"
Isaiah,25,10,The Lord's hand of protection will be on this mountain. But the Moabites will be trampled underfoot like straw into the water of a manure pit.
Isaiah,25,11,"They will reach out their hands to try and save themselves, like swimmers using their hands to swim, but their pride will be humbled however much they thrash about."
Isaiah,25,12,"Moab, he will demolish your fortress with the high walls, bringing it down to the ground, into the dust."
Isaiah,26,1,"At that time, this will be the song that is sung in the land of Judah: “Ours is a strong city! Its walls and defenses are our salvation!"
Isaiah,26,2,"Open the gates so the nation that does right may enter, the nation that stays faithful."
Isaiah,26,3,"You will keep in complete peace those who keep their minds focused on you, because they trust in you."
Isaiah,26,4,"Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord God is the eternal Rock."
Isaiah,26,5,"He brings down those who live so high and mighty; he demolishes the proud city with its high walls, bringing it down to the ground, into the dust."
Isaiah,26,6,The poor tread it underfoot; the oppressed walk on top of it.”
Isaiah,26,7,"You God, do what is right, and you straighten out the way for those who live right; you smooth out their path."
Isaiah,26,8,"Yes, we follow your instructions, Lord, we put our hope in you. What we most want is to remember you and your wonderful character."
Isaiah,26,9,"I look for you in the night; deep inside me I long for you. When your laws are shown to the earth, then the people of the world learn what is right."
Isaiah,26,10,"Though grace is shown to the wicked, they don't learn to do right. Even in a country where people do what's right, they continue to do evil and they don't think about how great the Lord is."
Isaiah,26,11,"Lord, you are holding your hand up, but they don't see it. Let them see your passionate commitment for your people, and be embarrassed; may the fire reserved for your enemies destroy them!"
Isaiah,26,12,"Lord, you give us peace and prosperity; everything we've achieved you have done for us."
Isaiah,26,13,"Lord our God, there have been other lords besides you who have ruled us, but you are the only one we worship."
Isaiah,26,14,"They are dead, they will not live again; they will not rise from the grave. Lord, you punished them and destroyed them—even wiping out every memory about them."
Isaiah,26,15,"You have made the nation grow, Lord, you have made the nation grow. You have expanded our borders of the land, and we honored you."
Isaiah,26,16,"Lord, when we were suffering we came to you, pouring out our prayers like whispers as you disciplined us."
Isaiah,26,17,"Just as a pregnant woman giving birth tosses about and cries out in pain, that's what we were like in your presence, Lord."
Isaiah,26,18,"However, even though we became pregnant and we tossed about in pain, we gave birth to nothing but air. We did not bring about the salvation of the earth, and the people of the world have not become alive."
Isaiah,26,19,"But those who died in you, Lord, will live! Their bodies will rise again! Wake up, and sing for joy, you people sleeping in the dust, for the dew you receive is like the dew of the morning giving life to those in the grave."
Isaiah,26,20,"My people, go inside your homes and close your doors behind you. Hide there for a little while until the fury has passed."
Isaiah,26,21,Watch out! The Lord is coming from where he lives to punish the people of the earth for their sins. The earth will reveal the blood that has been shed on it; the earth won't hide those who have been killed any longer.
Isaiah,27,1,"At that time the Lord will take his sharp, large, and strong sword, and punish Leviathan, the slithering serpent, and Leviathan, the coiled serpent, and he will kill the sea dragon."
Isaiah,27,2,"At that time, sing about a beautiful vineyard."
Isaiah,27,3,"I, the Lord, take care of it, watering it often. I guard it night and day so that nobody can damage it."
Isaiah,27,4,"I'm not angry anymore. If there are thorns and brambles I would go and fight them, burning them all up"
Isaiah,27,5,"Otherwise they should come to me for protection. They should make their peace with me, yes, make their peace with me."
Isaiah,27,6,"In the future the descendants of Jacob will be like a tree taking root. Israel will flower and send out shoots, and fill the whole world with fruit!"
Isaiah,27,7,Has the Lord hit Israel as he hit those that attacked them? Were they killed like their killers were killed?
Isaiah,27,8,"You dealt with them by sending them into exile, by banishing them. He drove them away with his powerful force, like when the east wind blows."
Isaiah,27,9,Through this experience Jacob's guilt will be forgiven. The removal of their sins will come to fruition when they take all the pagan altar stones and crush them to pieces like chalk—no Asherah poles or altars of incense will be left standing.
Isaiah,27,10,"The fortified city will be abandoned, its houses as empty and lonely as a desert. Cattle will graze and rest there, stripping bare the branches of its trees."
Isaiah,27,11,"Their dry branches are broken off and used by women to make fires. This is a people that doesn't have any sense, so their Maker won't feel sorry for them, and their Creator won't help them."
Isaiah,27,12,"At that time the Lord will thresh the grain harvested from the Euphrates River to the Wadi of Egypt, and you Israelites will be gathered up one by one."
Isaiah,27,13,"At that time a loud trumpet will sound, and those who were dying in Assyria will return along with those exiled in Egypt. They will come and worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem."
Isaiah,28,1,"Tragedy is coming to the city of Samaria, the crowning glory of Ephraim's drunks, to the fading flower of wonderful beauty, sitting above a fertile valley, and beloved by those hammered by wine."
Isaiah,28,2,"Watch out, for the Lord has someone who is strong and powerful! He is going to smash it to the ground like a hailstorm and a tornado, like a torrential rain and an overwhelming flood."
Isaiah,28,3,That crowning glory of Ephraim's drunks will be trampled underfoot.
Isaiah,28,4,"That fading flower of wonderful beauty, sitting above a fertile valley, will be like figs ripe before the summer harvest—as soon as people discover them, they grab and eat them."
Isaiah,28,5,"At that time the Lord Almighty will be a beautiful, glorious crown that brings pride to those of his people who are left."
Isaiah,28,6,"He will be an inspiration to the judges to do what's right, and he will encourage those who fight off the attacks on the gate."
Isaiah,28,7,"But these people also drink so much wine and beer that they sway from side to side and stumble over. Even priests and prophets stagger along, their minds muddled by beer and wine. Because of the drink they are confused about visions and make mistakes when they give decisions."
Isaiah,28,8,All their tables are full of vomit—filth is everywhere.
Isaiah,28,9,"“Just who is he trying to teach knowledge to?” they ask. “Who is he explaining his message to? To children just weaned from milk, to babies just removed from the breast?"
Isaiah,28,10,"He tells us this blah and that blah, blah upon blah, and again blah and blah, and even more blah and blah! It's a bit here and a bit there.”"
Isaiah,28,11,Fine—so now the Lord will talk to this people in foreign languages that sound strange to them!
Isaiah,28,12,"He had told them, “You can rest here. Let those who are tired rest. This is the place where you can safely relax.” But they refused to listen."
Isaiah,28,13,"Therefore the Lord's message to them will become, “This blah and that blah, blah upon blah, and again blah and blah, and even more blah and blah, a bit here and a bit there,” so that they'll fall over backwards, and they'll be wounded, trapped, and captured."
Isaiah,28,14,"So pay attention to the Lord's message, you scornful rulers who lead these people in Jerusalem."
Isaiah,28,15,"You claim, “We've made an agreement with death; we've got a contract with the grave. When the terrible disaster rushes by, it won't affect us, because our lies protect us and we hide in our own deceptions.”"
Isaiah,28,16,"Consequently, listen to what the Lord God says, Look! I'm laying a foundation stone in Jerusalem, a strong, well-tested stone. It's a valuable cornerstone that provides a firm foundation. Anyone who trusts in it won't be shaken loose."
Isaiah,28,17,"I will make justice as straight as a measuring line, and doing what's right the standard rule. Hail will destroy the protection of your lies, and water will flood the place where you're hiding."
Isaiah,28,18,"Your agreement with death will be canceled; your contract with the grave will be revoked. When the terrible disaster rushes by, it will trample you underfoot."
Isaiah,28,19,"It will rush by time after time, dragging you away morning upon morning, day and night, rushing on and on. Once you understand this message you will be absolutely terrified."
Isaiah,28,20,The bed is too short so you can't stretch out; the blanket is too narrow so you can't cover yourself.
Isaiah,28,21,"The Lord will come on the attack like he did to the Philistines at Mount Perazim, like he shook them in the Valley of Gibeon, coming to do what he has to do, his strange work; coming to act as he must, his unusual action."
Isaiah,28,22,"So don't mock, or your imprisonment will be even worse, for the Lord, the Lord Almighty, has explained to me his decision to destroy the whole country."
Isaiah,28,23,Listen to what I'm saying! Listen and pay attention! Hear what I have to say!
Isaiah,28,24,Does the farmer spend all his time plowing? Does he spend all his time preparing the soil?
Isaiah,28,25,"Once he has everything ready doesn't he sow seeds like dill and cumin, doesn't he plant wheat and barley in rows, with spelt grain as a border?"
Isaiah,28,26,His God gives him instructions and teaches him the right thing to do.
Isaiah,28,27,"You don't use a heavy tool to thresh dill! You don't use the wheel of a cart to thresh cumin! Instead you use a stick to beat out the dill, and a rod to beat out the cumin."
Isaiah,28,28,"Grain used for bread is easily damaged so you don't thresh it forever. When you drive your cart wheels over it with your horses, you don't crush it."
Isaiah,28,29,This is also from the Lord Almighty who is very wise and gives great advice.
Isaiah,29,1,"Tragedy is coming to you Ariel, Ariel the city where David lived! Year after year you have your festivals."
Isaiah,29,2,"But I'm going to cause trouble for Ariel; the city will cry and mourn, it will be like an altar hearth to me."
Isaiah,29,3,"I will surround you, I will besiege you with towers and build ramps to attack you."
Isaiah,29,4,"You will be brought down, you will speak from where you're lying on the ground, mumbling in the dust. Your words will come like a ghost from the grave; your voice will be a whisper from the dust."
Isaiah,29,5,"But then all your enemies will become like fine dust; all your cruel oppressors like chaff that's blown away. Then suddenly, in no time at all"
Isaiah,29,6,"the Lord Almighty will arrive with thunder, earthquake, and tremendous noise, with whirlwind, storm, and flames of fire that burn everything up."
Isaiah,29,7,"The nations besieging Ariel, attacking its fortifications and tormenting the people, they will all disappear as if it was a dream!"
Isaiah,29,8,"It will be like someone hungry dreaming that they're eating but who wakes up still hungry. It will be like someone thirsty dreaming of drinking but who wakes up still weak and thirsty. This is what it will be like for all your enemies, the ones attacking Mount Zion."
Isaiah,29,9,"Be shocked and amazed! Make yourselves blind so you can't see! Get drunk, but not from wine! Stagger around, but not from beer!"
Isaiah,29,10,"For the Lord has made you very sleepy, and he has shut the eyes and covered the heads of those who speak for God and see visions."
Isaiah,29,11,"This entire vision is like words in a scroll that is sealed shut. If you give it to someone who knows how to read and say, “Please read it,” they'll say, “I can't read it because it's sealed shut.”"
Isaiah,29,12,"If you give it to someone who doesn't know how to read and say, “Please read it,” they'll say, “I don't know how to read.”"
Isaiah,29,13,"The Lord says, “These people come and praise me with their words, and honor me with lip service, but their thoughts are miles away. Their worship of me only consists of them following rules people have taught them."
Isaiah,29,14,"So once again I will surprise these people with miracle upon miracle. The wisdom of the wise will die, and the insight of the insightful will disappear.”"
Isaiah,29,15,"Tragedy is coming to people who take such trouble to hide their plans from the Lord. They work in the dark and say to themselves, “Nobody can see us, can they? Nobody will know, will they?”"
Isaiah,29,16,"How perverse you are! It's as if the clay was thought of as making the potter! Should something made say to its maker, “You didn't make me”? Can the pot tell the potter, “You don't understand anything”?"
Isaiah,29,17,"It won't be long and the forests of Lebanon will be turned into a productive field, and a productive field will seem like a forest."
Isaiah,29,18,"At that time the deaf will hear the words of the scroll, and the eyes of the blind will see through the gloomy darkness what's written there."
Isaiah,29,19,"The humble will be even happier in the Lord, and the poor will find their joy in the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,29,20,"Cruel people will no longer exist, the scornful will vanish, and those looking to do evil will be destroyed"
Isaiah,29,21,"those who say things to trick others into sin, those who trap people by legal arguments in court, those who lie to mislead the innocent."
Isaiah,29,22,"So this is what the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, says to the descendants of Jacob: “You don't need to be ashamed anymore; your faces won't grow pale with fright any longer."
Isaiah,29,23,"When you see all your children and everything I've done for you, then you will regard my character as holy, and you will respect the Holy One of Jacob. You will have reverence for the God of Israel."
Isaiah,29,24,Those who've gone astray will understand their mistakes; those who grumble will learn how to receive instruction.”
Isaiah,30,1,"Tragedy is coming to my defiant children, declares the Lord. You make plans that don't come from me; you make alliances against my wishes, adding sin to sin."
Isaiah,30,2,"You go to Egypt without asking me, looking to Pharaoh for protection, hoping to find safety hiding behind Egypt."
Isaiah,30,3,But the protection of Pharaoh will be an embarrassment to you; hiding behind Egypt will only bring you humiliation.
Isaiah,30,4,Even though he has officials at Zoan and his messengers reach Hanes
Isaiah,30,5,"the Egyptians will offend everyone because they are useless—they're no help and good for nothing, except for causing shame and bringing disgrace."
Isaiah,30,6,"A message about the animals of the Negev. The messengers travel through a harsh and hostile land where lions and lionesses live, vipers and vicious snakes too. Their donkeys are burdened down with valuable gifts, their camels are loaded with treasure, to give to a worthless people that can't help."
Isaiah,30,7,Egypt's support is an empty breath of wind. That's why I call her Pride Sitting Down.
Isaiah,30,8,Now go and write all this down on a tablet and on a scroll so that it will last forever and ever.
Isaiah,30,9,"For they are a rebellious people, deceitful children, who refuse to listen to the Lord's instructions."
Isaiah,30,10,"They tell people who see visions, “Stop seeing visions!” and to the prophets, “Don't give us prophecies about doing right—just tell us pleasant things and give us fake prophecies."
Isaiah,30,11,Stop telling us straight; go a different direction! We don't want to hear any more about the Holy One of Israel.”
Isaiah,30,12,"So this is how the Holy One of Israel replies, Since you have rejected this message, and since you trust in oppression and believe in dishonesty"
Isaiah,30,13,"your punishment will suddenly fall on you, like a high wall that bulges out and collapses in an instant."
Isaiah,30,14,"You will be smashed like a clay pot, broken into such tiny pieces that there won't be a big enough piece to pick up coals from a hearth or a little bit of water from a well."
Isaiah,30,15,"This is what the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, said, If you repent and patiently trust in me, you would be saved; you would be strong if you had such calm confidence. But you refused to do it."
Isaiah,30,16,"You replied, “No! We'll escape on horseback! We'll get away on fast horses!”
But the fast ones will be the ones chasing you!"
Isaiah,30,17,"Just one of them will chase after a thousand of you. Just five of them will make you all run away. All that will be left of you will look like a flag fluttering on the top of a mountain, a banner waving on a hill."
Isaiah,30,18,"So the Lord waits, wanting to be kind to you, ready to act to show you mercy, for the Lord is a God who does what is right. All who wait for him are blessed."
Isaiah,30,19,"People of Zion, you who live in Jerusalem, you won't have to weep any more. When you cry for help he will be kind to you. He will answer you immediately when he hears you."
Isaiah,30,20,"Even though the Lord will give you the bread of hardship to eat and the water of suffering to drink, your teacher will no longer hide himself from you—you will see him with your own eyes."
Isaiah,30,21,"When you walk to the right or to the left, you will hear this command coming from behind you: “This is the way to follow.”"
Isaiah,30,22,"You will defile your silver-coated idols coated with silver and your gold-covered images. You will throw them away like a dirty cloth used for periods, and say to them, “out of here!”"
Isaiah,30,23,"He will send rain when you sow, and the land will produce great harvests. At that time your cattle will feed in rich pastures."
Isaiah,30,24,"The oxen and donkeys that help cultivate the earth will eat good greens and grain, spread with fork and shovel."
Isaiah,30,25,"At that time when your enemies are killed and the fortresses fall, streams of water will flow down every mountain and hill."
Isaiah,30,26,"The moon will shine as bright as the sun, and the sun will shine seven times brighter, like having seven days light in one. This is the way it will be when the Lord bandages the injuries of his people and heals the wounds he caused them."
Isaiah,30,27,"Look how the Lord arrives from far away, burning with anger and accompanied by thick clouds of smoke! What he says shows his anger—it's like a fire that burns everything up."
Isaiah,30,28,His breath rushes out like a flood that comes up to the neck. He shakes the nations in a sieve that destroys them; he puts bridles in the mouths of the different peoples to lead them away.
Isaiah,30,29,"But you will have a song to sing like you do on the night of a holy festival. You will celebrate in happiness like those who play pipes as they go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the Rock of Israel."
Isaiah,30,30,"The Lord will shout so everyone hears him he will reveal his great power. He will hit out in his anger and fury, with a fire that burns everything up, and with torrential rain, storm, and hail."
Isaiah,30,31,"At the Lord's command the Assyrians will be shattered, knocked down by his scepter."

Isaiah,32,14,"The palace is abandoned, the crowded town is deserted. Castles and watch towers will forever become homes loved by wild donkeys, and places where sheep graze"
Isaiah,32,15,"until the Spirit is poured out on us from above, and the desert becomes like a good field full of crops, and a good field will grow like a forest."
Isaiah,32,16,"Then people living in the desert will practice justice, and those living among the fields will do what is right."
Isaiah,32,17,Living right will bring peace and security that endures.
Isaiah,32,18,"My people will live in peace, safe and secure in their homes."
Isaiah,32,19,"Even though hail can destroy a forest, and a town can be demolished"
Isaiah,32,20,you will be happy as you sow your crops beside the waters and let your cattle and donkeys roam freely.

Isaiah,33,19,You won't see these offensive people anymore with their barbaric language that sounds like someone stammering and is impossible to understand.
Isaiah,33,20,"On the contrary, you'll see Zion as a festival city. You will view Jerusalem as a quiet and peaceful place. It will be like a tent that's never taken down, whose tent-pegs are never pulled up, whose guy ropes never snap."
Isaiah,33,21,Right here our majestic Lord will be like a place of broad rivers and waters that no enemy ship with oars can cross—no great ship can pass.
Isaiah,33,22,"For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king. He is the one who will save us."
Isaiah,33,23,The rigging on your ship hangs loose so the mast isn't secure and the sail can't be spread. Then all the looted treasure you're carrying will be divided among the victors—even those who are lame will have their share.

Isaiah,34,12,Its nobles won't have anything to call a kingdom; all its princes will be gone.

Isaiah,36,3,"Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, the palace manager, Shebnah the scribe, and Joah, son of Asaph, the record-keeper, went out to speak with him."
Isaiah,36,4,"The Assyrian army general said to them, “Tell Hezekiah this is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: What are you trusting in that gives you such confidence?"
Isaiah,36,5,"You say you have a strategy and are ready for war, but these are empty words. Who are you relying on, now that you have rebelled against me?"
Isaiah,36,6,"Now look! You're trusting in Egypt, a walking stick that's like a broken reed that will cut the hand of anyone leaning on it. That's what Pharaoh, king of Egypt, is like to everyone who trusts in him."

Isaiah,36,8,"Why don't you accept a challenge from my master, the king of Assyria? He says, I'll give you two thousand horses, if you can find enough riders for them!"

Isaiah,36,10,"More than that—would I have come to attack this place without the Lord's encouragement? It was the Lord himself who told me, ‘Go and attack this land and destroy it.’”"
Isaiah,36,11,"Eliakim, Shebnah, and Joah, said to the army general, “Please speak to us, your servants, in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew while the people on the wall are listening.”"
Isaiah,36,12,"But the army general replied, “Did my master only send me to say these things to your master and to you, and not to the people sitting on the wall? They too, just like you, are going to have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine!”"
Isaiah,36,13,"Then the army general shouted out in Hebrew, “Listen to this from the great king, the king of Assyria!"
Isaiah,36,14,This is what the king says: Don't let Hezekiah trick you! He can't save you!
Isaiah,36,15,"Don't believe Hezekiah when he tells you to trust in the Lord, saying, ‘I'm certain the Lord will save us. This city will never fall into the hands of the king of Assyria.’"
Isaiah,36,16,"Don't listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king says: Make a peace treaty with me and surrender to me. That way everyone will eat from their own vine and their own fig tree, and drink water from their own well!"
Isaiah,36,17,"I will come and take you to a land that's like your own, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards."
Isaiah,36,18,"But don't let Hezekiah trick you when he says, ‘The Lord will deliver us.’ Have any of the gods of any nation ever saved their land from the power of the king of Assyria?"
Isaiah,36,19,Where were the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where were the gods of Sepharvaim? Were they able to save Samaria from me?
Isaiah,36,20,Which one of all the gods of these countries has saved their land from me? How then could the Lord save Jerusalem from me?”

Isaiah,37,2,"He sent Eliakim the palace manager, Shebna, the scribe, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to see the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz."
Isaiah,37,3,"They told him, “This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day of trouble and of punishment. It's like when babies arrive at the entrance to the birth canal but there's no strength to deliver them."
Isaiah,37,4,"Maybe the Lord your God, hearing the message the army commander delivered on behalf of his master, the king of Assyria—a message sent to insult the living God—will punish him for his words. Please say a prayer for the remnant of us who still survive.”"
Isaiah,37,5,After Hezekiah's officials delivered his message to Isaiah
Isaiah,37,6,"Isaiah replied to them, “Tell your master, This is what the Lord says: Don't be frightened by the words that you have heard, the words used by the servants of the king of Assyria to blaspheme me."

Isaiah,37,10,"“Tell Hezekiah, king of Judah: ‘Don't let your God, the one you're trusting in, fool you by saying that Jerusalem won't fall into the hands of the king of Assyria."
Isaiah,37,11,Look! You've heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries they've invaded— they destroyed them completely! Do you really think you'll be saved?
Isaiah,37,12,"Did the gods of the nations my forefathers destroyed save them—the gods of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who lived in Telassar?"
Isaiah,37,13,"Where today is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?’”"
Isaiah,37,14,Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the Lord's Temple and opened it out before the Lord.
Isaiah,37,15,"Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying"
Isaiah,37,16,"“Lord Almighty, God of Israel, you who live above the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth, you are Creator of heaven and earth."
Isaiah,37,17,"Please listen with your ears, Lord, and hear; open your eyes, Lord, and see. Listen to the message that Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God."
Isaiah,37,18,"Yes, it's true, Lord, that the Assyrian kings have destroyed these nations and their lands."
Isaiah,37,19,"They have thrown their gods into the fire because they are not really gods—they are just the work of human hands, made of wood and stone so they could destroy them."
Isaiah,37,20,"Now, Lord our God, please save us from him, in order that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that only you, Lord, are God.”"
Isaiah,37,21,"Then Isaiah, son of Amoz, sent a message to Hezekiah, saying, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Because you've prayed to me about Sennacherib, king of Assyria"
Isaiah,37,22,this is the word of the Lord condemning him: The virgin daughter of Zion scorns you and mocks you; the daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head as you run away.
Isaiah,37,23,Who have you been insulting and ridiculing? Who did you raise your voice against? Who did you look at with so proud eyes? It was against the Holy One of Israel!
Isaiah,37,24,"By your servants you have mocked the Lord. You said: ‘With my many chariots I have ascended to the high mountains, to the farthest peaks of Lebanon. I have chopped down its tallest cedars, the best of its cypress trees. I have reached its most distant heights, its deepest forests."
Isaiah,37,25,I have dug wells and drunk water in foreign lands. With the soles of my feet I dried up all the rivers in Egypt.’”
Isaiah,37,26,"The Lord replies, “Haven't you heard? I decided it long ago; I planned it in the olden days. Now I am making sure it happens—that you are to knock down fortified towns into piles of rubble."
Isaiah,37,27,"Their people, powerless, are terrified and humiliated. They're like plants in a field, like soft green shoots, like grass that sprouts on the rooftop—scorched before it can even grow."
Isaiah,37,28,"But I know you very well—where you live, when you come in, when you leave, and your furious anger against me."
Isaiah,37,29,"Because of your furious anger against me, and because I know how you disrespect me, I'm going to put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will force you to return the same way you came."
Isaiah,37,30,"Hezekiah, this will be a sign to prove this is true: This year you'll eat what grows by itself. The second year you'll eat what grows from that. But in the third year you'll sow and reap, you'll plant vineyards and eat their fruit."
Isaiah,37,31,"The remnant that's left of Judah will revive again, sending roots below and bearing fruit above."
Isaiah,37,32,"For a remnant will come out of Jerusalem, and survivors will come from Mount Zion. The intense determination of the Lord will make sure this happens."

Isaiah,37,37,"Sennacherib, king of Assyria, gave up and left. He returned home to Nineveh and stayed there."
Isaiah,37,38,"While he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword and then ran away to the land of Ararat. His son Esar-haddon succeeded him as king."
Isaiah,38,1,"About this time Hezekiah fell very sick and was about to die. The prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, went to him and said, “This is what the Lord says: Put your affairs in order, because you are going to die. You won't recover.”"
Isaiah,38,2,"When Hezekiah heard this, he went to pray privately to the Lord, saying"
Isaiah,38,3,“Please remember Lord how I have followed you faithfully with all my heart. I have done what is good in your sight.” Then Hezekiah cried and cried.

Isaiah,38,16,"Lord, we live by what you say and do, and I find life in all of this. You have given me back my health and allowed me to live."
Isaiah,38,17,It was definitely for my own good I went through this bitter experience. You in your love saved me from the pit of destruction and you have forgiven all my sins.

Isaiah,40,15,It's obvious that the nations are just a drop in a bucket. They're like dust on a set of scales. He can pick up islands as if they weigh next to nothing.
Isaiah,40,16,All the wood in Lebanon for a fire and all its animals as a sacrifice wouldn't be enough to provide a burnt offering.

Isaiah,41,6,"They all help each other, encouraging one another to “Be strong!”"

Isaiah,42,1,"Look! Here is my servant, the one I support; my chosen one who pleases me. I have placed my Spirit on him, and he will show the nations what is right."
Isaiah,42,2,He won't shout or cry out; he won't raise his voice in the street.
Isaiah,42,3,He won't break a damaged reed; he won't snuff out a smoldering wick. He will faithfully make sure everyone is treated fairly.
Isaiah,42,4,He won't give up or become discouraged until he has made sure that justice is upheld throughout the world. Even lands overseas will look forward to his teachings.

Isaiah,42,22,"But this people ended up robbed and raided, all of them trapped in holes or hidden in prisons. They have been stolen like loot, with no one to save them from being someone's prize, no one to say “Give them back!”"
Isaiah,42,23,"Who of you is going to listen to this, or pay attention later on?"
Isaiah,42,24,"Who let Jacob be taken as loot; who let Israel be taken by robbers? Wasn't it the Lord who we sinned against? The people weren't willing to follow his ways, and they refused to obey his law."

Isaiah,43,10,"However, you are my witnesses, the Lord declares, and my chosen servant, so that you can think about it, and believe me and understand that I am God. No god preceded me, and none will come after me."

Isaiah,44,16,"So he burns part of the wood to roast his meat to eat, and to warm him up, and says, “Ah! Look at that fire that keeps me warm!”"

Isaiah,45,9,"What trouble people face when they fight with their Creator—they're just pots among all the other pots on earth! Does the clay tell the potter who is shaping it, “What are you doing?” or “What you're making is so bad it's like you have no hands!”"
Isaiah,45,10,"How bad it would be if you said to your father, “Why did you have me?” or to your mother, “Why was I ever born?”!"

Isaiah,45,20,"Gather yourselves together, and come, come close, you refugees of the nations. Aren't they stupid, these people who carry around their wooden idols, and who pray to a god that can't save them?"
Isaiah,45,21,"Discuss this together, and then speak up, present your case. Who predicted this long ago? Who said what would happen in the future back in the past? Wasn't that me, the Lord? There is no other God except me, no other God who does what is right, and who saves. There is no God apart from me."

Isaiah,47,8,"Now listen to this, you sensual woman, sitting there so sure of yourself, saying to yourself, “I am supreme—there's nobody besides me. I shall never be a widow or experience the loss of my children.”"
Isaiah,47,9,"But both these things will happen to you in quick succession! In just one day you will lose your children and become a widow. You will have this experience in its totality, in spite of all your witchcraft, in spite of all your magic spells."
Isaiah,47,10,"You put your trust in your evil actions, saying, “No one can see what I'm doing.” Your wisdom and knowledge seduced you, and you told yourself, “I am supreme—there's nobody besides me.”"
Isaiah,47,11,"Evil is going to strike you, and you won't be able to magic it away. Disaster will fall on you that you can't stop by paying a ransom. Destruction will suddenly hit you that you weren't expecting."

Isaiah,47,13,"All the advice you've received has worn you out! Where are your astrologers, those who look to the stars for guidance, who give you their predictions every month? Let them stand up and save you from what's coming down on you!"

That's because whenever you fast you still do whatever you want, and you treat your workers badly."
Isaiah,58,4,"Can't you see that when you're fasting you quarrel and argue, and end up having a vicious fistfight? When you fast like this you can't expect your prayers to be heard on high!"
Isaiah,58,5,"Is this the kind of fast I want when people act out their humility by bowing their heads down like a reed and by lying around in sackcloth and ashes? Is that what you call a fast, a day the Lord appreciates?"
Isaiah,58,6,"No, this is the fast I want: set free those who have been unjustly imprisoned, untie the cords of the yoke used to burden people, set free those who are oppressed, and get rid of every form of abuse."
Isaiah,58,7,"Share your food with the hungry, take the poor and homeless into your house. When you see people naked, give them clothes, and don't reject your own relatives."
Isaiah,58,8,"Then your light will shine out like the dawn, and you will be healed quickly; your salvation will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will go behind you."
Isaiah,58,9,"Then when you call, the Lord will answer; when you cry out for help, the Lord will say, “I'm here.” If you get rid of oppression among you, if you stop pointing the finger and slandering others"
Isaiah,58,10,"if you dedicate yourselves to helping the hungry and give the poor what they need, then your light will shine out in the darkness, and your night will be like the sun at noon."
Isaiah,58,11,"The Lord will always lead you; he will give you all you need in you in a desolate land; he will make you strong again. You will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring that never runs dry."
Isaiah,58,12,"Some among you will rebuild the ancient ruins; you will restore generations-old foundations. You will be called the Repairer of the Break in the Wall, the Restorer of Life's Pathways."
Isaiah,58,13,"If you make sure you don't break the Sabbath by doing whatever you please on my holy day, if you say the Sabbath brings you pleasure and the Lord's day is to be honored, and if you honor it by leaving aside your own ways, by not doing whatever you please, and by avoiding chatting about ordinary things"
Isaiah,58,14,"then you'll find the Lord is the one who truly makes you happy, and I will give you high positions on the earth and give you what I promised to Jacob, your forefather. I, the Lord, have spoken."
Isaiah,59,1,"Don't you see? The Lord's arm isn't too weak to save you, and his ear isn't too deaf to hear you!"
Isaiah,59,2,It's your guilt that has created a barrier between you and your God; your sins have hidden his face from you so he can't hear you.
Isaiah,59,3,"Your hands are covered in blood and your fingers tainted with guilt, your lips speak lies and your mouth whispers evil things."
Isaiah,59,4,"Nobody wants justice, nobody pleads their case with honesty. They rely on false testimony, and tell lies. They conceive evil plans, and give birth to trouble."
Isaiah,59,5,"They hatch viper's eggs, and weave a spider's web. If you eat their eggs you'll die; if you crush their eggs you'll only hatch snakes."
Isaiah,59,6,Their webs can't be made into clothes; they can't cover themselves by what they produce. What they do is wicked; they use their hands to commit violence.
Isaiah,59,7,They run to do evil; they're quick to murder innocent people. Their minds are full of sinful thoughts; they only cause havoc and destruction.
Isaiah,59,8,"They don't know how to live in peace; they're not straight and fair with others. Their way is totally crooked, and anyone who follows them won't experience any peace."
Isaiah,59,9,"So that's why we don't have justice, and we don't do what's right. We look for the light, but only find the dark; we look for bright light, but we walk in deep darkness."
Isaiah,59,10,"We grope like blind people along a wall, feeling with our hands as if we have no eyes. We stumble at noon as if it were the evening. Among those who are full of life, we are like the dead."
Isaiah,59,11,"All of us growl like bears and coo like doves as we wait for justice to be done, but it never happens; we wait for salvation, but never receive it."
Isaiah,59,12,"You are aware of all our rebellious acts; our sins witness against us. Yes, we acknowledge our rebellious acts; we know all about our sins."
Isaiah,59,13,"We have disobeyed and denied you, Lord; we have turned our backs on our God. We have encouraged oppression and rebellion, telling lies we've carefully thought out."
Isaiah,59,14,"Justice is rejected, and doing right never happens. Truth falls down in the street, and honesty is banned."
Isaiah,59,15,"There's no truth anywhere, and anyone who does give up evil is robbed. The Lord saw what was going on, and was upset that there was no justice."
Isaiah,59,16,"He looked around, and he was appalled to find there was no one who would do anything about it, so he intervened himself, and his sense of what was right kept him going."
Isaiah,59,17,"He put on integrity as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head. He put on clothes of vengeance and wrapped himself with determination as a cloak."
Isaiah,59,18,"He will repay everyone for what they've done: fury to his enemies, revenge to those who oppose him, payback to the distant lands."
Isaiah,59,19,"Those in the west will be in awe of the Lord, and those in the east will be amazed at his glory, for he will arrive like a raging flood, driven by the Spirit of the Lord."

Isaiah,59,21,"This is my agreement with them, says the Lord. My Spirit, who is upon you, won't leave you, and my words that I have given you to speak will always be on your lips, on the lips of your children, and on the lips of your descendants, from now until forever, says the Lord."

Isaiah,60,8,"What are these flying like a cloud, flying like pigeons returning to their roost?"
Isaiah,60,9,"These are ships led by those of Tarshish, coming from the islands that trust in me, bringing your children home from far away, and carrying with them silver and gold. They come to honor the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, for he has made you glorious."
Isaiah,60,10,"Foreigners will rebuild your walls, and their kings will work for you. Even though I did hit you when I was angry with you, now I will be kind and merciful to you."
Isaiah,60,11,"Your gates will always be kept open. They won't ever be shut, day or night, so the wealth of the nations can be brought to you, with their kings being led along in a procession."
Isaiah,60,12,Any nation or kingdom that does not serve you will be completely destroyed.

Isaiah,60,14,"The children of those who persecuted you will come and bow before you; everyone who looked down on you will bow down at your feet and will call you the City of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,60,15,"Once you were abandoned and despised, somewhere people didn't go, but now I will make you a place to be proud of forever, a joy to every generation."
Isaiah,60,16,"Nations will provide you with what you need, kings will take care of you as if you were their own children. You will know that I, the Lord, am your Savior and Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob."
Isaiah,60,17,"I will bring you gold instead of bronze, silver instead of iron, bronze instead of wood, and iron instead of stone. I will appoint Peace as your watchman, and Goodness as your leader."

Isaiah,61,2,"to declare the year of the Lord's grace and the day of our God's punishment, to comfort those who mourn."
Isaiah,61,3,"The Lord will give to everyone who mourns in Zion a crown instead of ashes on their head, the oil of happiness instead of mourning, clothes of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of integrity, planted by the Lord to reveal his glory."

Isaiah,61,5,"Foreigners will shepherd your flocks, and take care of your fields, and look after your vineyards."
Isaiah,61,6,"You will be called priests of the Lord, identified as ministers of our God. You will enjoy the wealth of nations and be proud that you have it."
Isaiah,61,7,"Instead of shame you will receive a double blessing; instead of insults, you will be happy to have a double amount of land given to you, and your joy will last forever."
Isaiah,61,8,"I, the Lord, love what is right. I hate robbery and injustice. I will faithfully reward my people and make an everlasting agreement with them."
Isaiah,61,9,"Their descendants will be acknowledged among the nations, and their children among the peoples. Everyone who sees them will agree that they are people that the Lord has blessed."
Isaiah,61,10,"I will happily celebrate in the Lord! My whole being will shout praises to my God. For he has dressed me with the clothing of salvation, and has wrapped around me a robe of goodness. I am like a bridegroom dressed for the wedding, like a bride wearing her jewels."
Isaiah,61,11,"Just as the earth sends up shoots, and plants grow in a garden, so the Lord makes goodness and praise grow before all nations."
Isaiah,62,1,"I can't remain silent because of my love for Zion, I can't keep quiet because of my love for Jerusalem, until her integrity shines like a beam of light, until her salvation blazes like a burning torch."

Isaiah,62,4,"You won't be called Abandoned anymore; your land won't be called Desolate. Instead you will be called She Makes Me Happy, and your land will be called Married, because you make the Lord happy, and your land will be married."
Isaiah,62,5,"For just like a young man marries a young woman, so your sons will marry you; and like a groom is happy with his bride, so your God will be happy with you."

Isaiah,62,8,"The Lord has made a solemn promise, swearing by his power and might: I won't ever again let your enemies have your grain to eat, or let foreigners drink the new wine you worked hard for."

Isaiah,63,1,"Who is this coming from Edom, from the town of Bozrah with clothes stained crimson? Who is this wearing robes of splendor, leaning forward in his great strength as he marches?
It is me, the one who always speaks goodness and truth, the one who has the power to save."
Isaiah,63,2,"Why are your clothes red, like you've been treading grapes in a winepress?"
Isaiah,63,3,"I've been treading the winepress by myself; from the nations around no one came to help me. So in my anger I trod them down as if they were grapes, in my fury I trampled them. It's their blood that has stained my clothes."
Isaiah,63,4,For I decided this was the day of my vengeance; the year of my redemption has come.
Isaiah,63,5,"I looked around, but no one came to help; I was shocked that there was no one to assist me. So I saved them through my own strength alone, and my own anger kept me going."
Isaiah,63,6,"I trampled down the nations in my anger; in my fury I made them drunk, and spilled their blood upon the ground."
Isaiah,63,7,I want to tell everyone about the Lord's trustworthy love. I will praise the Lord for everything he's done for us—all the good things he has done for the descendants of Israel because of his kindness and his infinite trustworthy love.
Isaiah,63,8,"He said, “Aren't they my people, children who wouldn't lie to me?” So he became their Savior."

Isaiah,63,10,"But they rebelled against him, and caused his Holy Spirit grief, so to them he became like an enemy and he fought against them."
Isaiah,63,11,"Then they thought back to the days of old when Moses led his people out of Egypt. They shouted out, “Where is the one who took Israel through the sea, along with the shepherds of his flock? Where is the one who placed his Holy Spirit among his people?"
Isaiah,63,12,"Where is the one who lifted Moses' right hand, and who used his amazing power to divide the sea in front of them, giving him such a wonderful, enduring reputation?"
Isaiah,63,13,"Where is the one who led them through the depths of the sea?” They were like a horse running through the desert, they didn't stumble."
Isaiah,63,14,"Like cattle descending into a valley, the Lord's Spirit gave them rest. This is how you led your people, earning a glorious reputation for yourself."
Isaiah,63,15,"Lord, look down on us from heaven! Watch from your high home, in your holiness and glory! Where is your enthusiasm and power? You're not showing me your feelings of sympathy and kindness!"
Isaiah,63,16,"But you are still our Father, even though Abraham wouldn't know us and Israel wouldn't acknowledge us. You, Lord, are our Father; you have always been called our Redeemer from long ago."
Isaiah,63,17,"Lord, why do you make us wander from your ways, and make us stubborn so we don't respect you? Come back to us for the sake of your servants, the tribes that belong to you."
Isaiah,63,18,"Your Temple belonged to us for a little while, but then our enemies invaded and destroyed it."
Isaiah,63,19,"We were yours from ancient times, but we've ended up like people you've never ruled, never identified as yours."
Isaiah,64,1,If only you would rip the heavens apart and come down! The mountains would tremble in your presence!
Isaiah,64,2,"In the same way that fire burns wood and makes water boil, make your reputation known to your enemies, so that nations will tremble in your presence!"
Isaiah,64,3,In the past you did things we weren't anticipating. You came down and the mountains trembled in your presence!
Isaiah,64,4,"Since the beginning, no one has heard about, no one has paid attention to, and no one has seen any God except you, the one who helps those who place their confidence in you."
Isaiah,64,5,"You join with those who are glad, and with those who do what's right and remember to follow your ways. But when we went on sinning, you became angry. How can we be saved if we go on like this?"
Isaiah,64,6,"We've all become unclean, and all the good things we do are like dirty rags. We wither and die like autumn leaves, and our sins, like the wind, blow us away."
Isaiah,64,7,"There's no one who calls for you or really wants to hold on to you, because you have hidden your face from us and let us drown in our own sins."
Isaiah,64,8,"But you, Lord, are our Father. We're the clay, you're the potter. You made us all with your own hands."
Isaiah,64,9,"Please limit your anger, Lord, and don't remember our sins forever. Look at us, and see that we are all your people."
Isaiah,64,10,"Your holy cities have been turned into a wilderness; Zion has become a desert; yes, even Jerusalem is an abandoned ruin."
Isaiah,64,11,"Our beautiful, holy Temple where our forefathers praised you has been burned down, and all that we treasured has been destroyed."
Isaiah,64,12,"In view of all this, are you still going to refuse to help us? Are you going to stay quiet and punish us so severely?"
Isaiah,65,1,"I let myself be consulted by people who weren't even asking me questions; I let myself be found by people who weren't even looking for me. To a nation that wasn't even calling for me, I said, “I'm here, I'm here!”"
Isaiah,65,2,"I spread out my hands all day long, pleading with a stubborn people who follow bad ways, doing whatever they choose."
Isaiah,65,3,"These people are always making me angry, because they present sacrifices to idols in their sacred gardens, and offer incense on pagan altars made of brick."
Isaiah,65,4,"They spend the night among the graves and in caves, eating pork and cooking other unclean meats."
Isaiah,65,5,"They tell others, “Keep your distance! Don't come close to me as I'm too holy to be touched by you!” These people are like smoke in my nostrils, a stink burning all day long!"
Isaiah,65,6,Look—it's all written down right in front of me! I'm not going to keep quiet. I'm going to pay them back by throwing their punishment into their laps.
Isaiah,65,7,"I'm going to pay you back for both your own sins and the sins of your forefathers, says the Lord, because they burned incense on the mountains and ridiculed me on the hills. I'm going to measure into their laps full payment for what they've done."
Isaiah,65,8,"This is what the Lord says: It's like when there's a bit of juice left in a bunch of grapes and people say, “Don't get rid of it all; there's still some good in it.” I'll do the same for my servants—I won't destroy them all."
Isaiah,65,9,"I will make sure Jacob has descendants, and people from Judah who can take ownership of my mountain. My chosen ones, my servants, will own the land and live there."
Isaiah,65,10,"Sharon will become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to rest, for my people who follow me."

Isaiah,65,12,"I will make sure your destiny is to be killed by the sword. All of you will bow down to be slaughtered, because I called out to you but you didn't answer; I spoke to you, but you didn't listen. Instead you did what's evil in my sight, choosing to do what I hate."
Isaiah,65,13,"So this is what the Lord says, My servants will eat, but you will go hungry. My servants will drink, but you will go thirsty. My servants will celebrate, but you will feel ashamed."
Isaiah,65,14,"Listen! My servants will shout because they're so happy inside, but you will cry out in deepest pain, howling because your spirit is broken."
Isaiah,65,15,"Your name will only be used as a curse by my chosen ones, for the Lord God will kill you and give his servants another name."

Isaiah,65,20,"No babies will die after just a few days, and no adults will die without having lived a long life. Those who reach a hundred will be thought of as just a child, and anyone who doesn't reach a hundred will be seen as being under a curse."
Isaiah,65,21,They will build houses and live in them; they will eat the fruit of the vineyards they themselves planted.
Isaiah,65,22,No longer will they build houses for others to live in; no longer will they plant for others to eat. For my people will live as long as trees do; my chosen ones will live long enough to enjoy all they've worked for.
Isaiah,65,23,"They won't work for nothing, and they won't have children destined for disaster. For they are people living under the blessing of the Lord, and their children will be too."
Isaiah,65,24,"I will reply even before they ask me. While they are still speaking, I will answer them!"
Isaiah,65,25,The wolf and the lamb will eat together. The lion will eat straw like the ox. The snakes will eat dust. Nothing will cause any harm or damage anywhere on my holy mountain.
Isaiah,66,1,"This is what the Lord says: Heaven is my throne, and the earth is where I place my feet. So where will this house be that you're going to build for me? Where will I lie down to rest?"
Isaiah,66,2,"I made everything; that's how it all came into existence, says the Lord. Those I look favorably on are humble and repentant, and they tremble when I speak."
Isaiah,66,3,"When someone sacrifices a bull it's like human sacrifice, and when someone sacrifices a lamb, it's like breaking the neck of a dog. When they present a grain offering it's like presenting pig's blood, and when they burn incense it's like worshiping an idol. Since they have chosen to act like this and to love such disgusting things"
Isaiah,66,4,"I will also choose to punish them severely and to terrify them, because I called out to them but no one answered; I spoke to them, but no one listened. Instead they did what's evil in my sight, choosing to do what I hate."
Isaiah,66,5,"Listen to what the Lord has to say, those of you who tremble when he speaks. This is what some of your people who hate you and throw you out have said: “Let the Lord be glorified, so we can see how happy you are!” but it's them who are going to be humiliated."
Isaiah,66,6,Hear all the shouting from the city! Hear all the noise from the Temple! It's the sound of the Lord giving his enemies back what they deserve.
Isaiah,66,7,"She gave birth before she went into labor, she delivered a boy before the pains came."
Isaiah,66,8,"Who has ever heard of anything like this? Who has seen this kind of thing before? Can a country be delivered in a day, can a nation be born in a moment? Yet as soon as Zion went into labor, she gave birth to her children."
Isaiah,66,9,Would I bring a baby to the point of birth and then not deliver it? the Lord asks. Would I who deliver the baby stop it from being born? the Lord asks again.
Isaiah,66,10,"Celebrate with Jerusalem and be happy for her, everyone who loves her; celebrate with her and sing for joy, everyone who mourns over her."
Isaiah,66,11,"Like a baby you can nurse at her breasts that bring comfort, drinking deeply and being satisfied by all she has to give."

Isaiah,66,17,"Those who dedicate themselves and make themselves pure in order to enter the sacred gardens, to worship the idol placed in the center, and to eat pork and vermin and rats and other disgusting things—they will all die together, says the Lord."
Isaiah,66,18,I know what they're doing and what they're thinking. I will soon come to gather all nations and peoples of different languages. They will come and see my glory.
Isaiah,66,19,"I will give them a sign, and I will send some who survive to the nations. They will go to Tarshish, to the Libyans and Lydians (who are famous as archers), to Tubal and Greece, and to the distant lands that haven't heard about me or seen my glory. They will announce my glory among the nations."
Isaiah,66,20,"They will bring back all your people from every nation to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the Lord. They will come on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels, says the Lord. They will bring them in the same way the Israelites bring their grain offerings to the Lord's Temple using vessels that are ceremonially clean."
Isaiah,66,21,"I will choose some of them as priests and Levites, says the Lord."
Isaiah,66,22,"As the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, will last forever, so your descendants and your reputation will also last forever, says the Lord."
Isaiah,66,23,"Everyone will come and worship me, from one New Moon to the next, and from one Sabbath to the next, says the Lord."
Isaiah,66,24,"They will go out and see the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me. The worms that eat them won't die, the fire that burns them won't go out, and everyone who sees them will be horrified."
