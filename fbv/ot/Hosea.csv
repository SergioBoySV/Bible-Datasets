Hosea,1,1,"The Lord sent a message to Hosea son of Beeri at the time when Uzziah, Jotham, and Ahaz were the kings of Judah, and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was the king of Israel."
Hosea,1,2,"The Lord began speaking through Hosea by telling him, “Go and take a wife who is a prostitute and have children born to a prostitute, because those living in this land have committed terrible prostitution by turning away from the Lord.”"
Hosea,1,3,"So Hosea went and married Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim. She became pregnant and bore Hosea a son."
Hosea,1,4,"The Lord told Hosea, “Call him Jezreel, because I am going to punish the house of Jehu for the blood he shed at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel."
Hosea,1,5,On that day I will break Israel's military power in the valley of Jezreel.”
Hosea,1,6,"Gomer became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter. The Lord told Hosea, “Call her Lo-ruhamah, because I will no longer love the house of Israel and certainly not forgive them."
Hosea,1,7,"But I will have pity on the house of Judah, and I will save them—but I will not save them by bow or sword or war or horses and riders.”"
Hosea,1,8,After Gomer had weaned Lo-ruhamah she became pregnant again and gave birth to a son.
Hosea,1,9,"The Lord told Hosea, “Call him Lo-ammi, because you are not my people and I am not your God."
Hosea,1,10,Even so the number of the people of Israel will be like the sand on the seashore that cannot be measured or counted. Then right there at the place where they were told ‘you are not my people’ they will be called ‘the children of the living God.’
Hosea,1,11,"The people of Israel and the people of Judah will be gathered together and they will choose one leader for themselves and they will take possession of the land, and the day of Jezreel will be great.”"
Hosea,2,1,"“On that day you will call your brothers Ammi, and you will call your sisters Ruhamah."
Hosea,2,2,"Condemn your mother, condemn her because she is not my wife and I am not her husband. Tell her to stop looking like a prostitute—get rid of the makeup and the provocative clothing."
Hosea,2,3,"Otherwise I will strip her naked as the day she was born, and make her like a desert, a barren land, and let her die of thirst."
Hosea,2,4,"I will have no pity on her children, because they are children of prostitution."
Hosea,2,5,"For their mother was a prostitute who conceived them in a shameful way. She said, ‘I'll run after my lovers who give me my food and water, my wool and flax and olive oil, and my drink.’"
Hosea,2,6,"That is why I am going to block her path with thorn bushes, and build a stone wall to stop her so she won't find her way."
Hosea,2,7,"When she runs after her lovers she won't catch up with them; she'll look for them but she won't find them. Then she'll say, ‘Let me go back to my former husband, because it was better for me then than now.’"
Hosea,2,8,"She doesn't consider that it was me who gave her grain, new wine, and olive oil, nor the silver and the gold which I gave her abundantly that they made into an idol of Baal."
Hosea,2,9,So I will take back my ripened grain and my new wine I gave at harvest-time. I will take back my wool and my flax I provided to cover her nakedness.
Hosea,2,10,I will strip her naked while her lovers watch; no one will be able to rescue her from me.
Hosea,2,11,"I will put a stop to all her festivities: her feasts, new moon celebrations, special Sabbaths—all her festivals."
Hosea,2,12,I will destroy her vines and fig trees that she said were given to her as payment for being a prostitute. I will turn them into scrub-land; only wild animals will eat the remaining fruit.
Hosea,2,13,"I will punish her for all the times she offered incense to Baal, dressing herself up, putting on rings and jewelry, going after her lovers, but forgetting about me, declares the Lord."
Hosea,2,14,"See what I'm going to do! I will win her back, taking her into the desert where I will speak to her heart-to-heart."
Hosea,2,15,"There I will return her vineyards to her and make the Valley of Achor a door of hope. There she will respond to me as she did when she was young, as in the time when she left the land of Egypt."
Hosea,2,16,"Then on that day, says the Lord, you will call me ‘my husband’ and not ‘my Baal.’"
Hosea,2,17,I will stop her appealing to the Baals—their names won't be mentioned ever again.
Hosea,2,18,At that time I will make a solemn agreement with the wild animals and the birds of the sky and the creeping things of the ground. I will do away with the bow and the sword; I will abolish war from the land so you can lie down in safety.
Hosea,2,19,I will make you my wife forever; I will make you my wife in goodness and justice and love and mercy.
Hosea,2,20,"I will be faithful to you, my wife, and you will know me as the Lord."
Hosea,2,21,"On that day, declares the Lord, I will answer the heavens and they will answer the earth."
Hosea,2,22,"The earth will answer the grain, and the new wine, and the olive oil, and they shall answer, ‘Jezreel’ (God sows)."
Hosea,2,23,"I will ‘sow’ her for myself in the earth. I will love Lo-ruhamah (unloved) and I will say ‘You are my people’ to Lo-ammi (not my people), and they will say, ‘You are my God.’”"
Hosea,3,1,"The Lord told me, “Go again and love a woman who is loved by another and who is committing adultery, just as the Lord loves the children of Israel, even though they turn to other gods and love their sensual worship.”"
Hosea,3,2,So I bought her back for fifteen shekels of silver and one and half homers of barley.
Hosea,3,3,"I told her, “You must remain with me for many days and you shall stop your prostitution. You shall not be intimate with any man, and then I shall be yours.”"
Hosea,3,4,"For the people of Israel shall be without a king or a prince, without a sacrifice or a stone pillar or a pagan image or an idolatrous shrine for a long time."
Hosea,3,5,"After this, the people of Israel will return and dedicate themselves to the Lord their God and to the line of David their king. In the last days they will come with awe and reverence for the Lord and his goodness."
Hosea,4,1,"Hear the word of the Lord, people of Israel, for the Lord has an accusation against the inhabitants of the land! “There is no faithfulness, no loyalty, and no knowledge of God in the land."
Hosea,4,2,"Instead there is only cursing, lying, murdering, stealing, and adultery. They commit violence, and bloodshed follows bloodshed."
Hosea,4,3,"As a result the land dries up, and everyone who lives there is wasting away, along with the wild animals and the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea—they are all dying."
Hosea,4,4,But no one should accuse or blame anyone else. My quarrel is with you the priests—you are the ones responsible.
Hosea,4,5,"Consequently you will stumble in daylight, and the prophet will stumble together with you in the night, and I will destroy your mother."
Hosea,4,6,"My people are dying because they don't know me. Because you have refused to know me, I refuse to accept you as my priests. You have forgotten my teachings, so I will forget your children."
Hosea,4,7,"The more there were of them, the more they sinned against me, so I will change their glory into shame."
Hosea,4,8,"They feed on the sin of my people, greedy for their iniquity."
Hosea,4,9,"So it will be for the people like the priests: I will punish them for what they have done, repaying them for their actions."
Hosea,4,10,"They will eat, but they will not be satisfied; they will engage in prostitution, but they will not prosper because they have given up on the Lord to go and prostitute themselves to other gods."
Hosea,4,11,They destroy their minds with old wine and new wine.
Hosea,4,12,"My people consult their wooden idols and their divining rods give them answers, for a spirit of prostitution makes them go astray. Prostituting themselves, they have deserted their God."
Hosea,4,13,"They offer sacrifices on the tops of mountains; they burn incense in the hills under the oak, poplar, and terebinth trees where the shade is pleasant. That's the reason why your daughters practice prostitution and your daughters-in-law commit adultery."
Hosea,4,14,"I will not punish your daughters when they practice prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because you men visit whores and sacrifice with temple prostitutes. A people who lack understanding end up in disaster."
Hosea,4,15,"Though you, Israel, have become a prostitute, may Judah not offend in the same way and not enter Gilgal, nor go up to Beth-aven, nor swear saying, ‘The Lord lives.’"
Hosea,4,16,For Israel is as stubborn as a stubborn cow. Should the Lord then take care of them like a lamb in a wide pasture?
Hosea,4,17,"Ephraim is bewitched by idols, so leave him alone!"
Hosea,4,18,"Once the leaders finish drinking, they go off and find prostitutes to sleep with. They love their shameful acts more than honor."
Hosea,4,19,A wind will carry them away; they will be ashamed of their pagan worship.”
Hosea,5,1,"“Hear this, you priests! Pay attention, house of Israel! Listen, members of the royal family!"
Hosea,5,2,"Judgment belongs with you because you have been a snare set at Mizpah and a net spread out on Tabor. You dug a deep trap in Shittim, but I will punish you for all these things you have done."
Hosea,5,3,"I know Ephraim very well, and Israel cannot hide from me, for now Ephraim is a prostitute and Israel is defiled."
Hosea,5,4,Your actions stop you from coming back to your God for a spirit of prostitution is within you and you do not know the Lord.
Hosea,5,5,"Israel's pride speaks against them, right in the face. Israel and Ephraim will stumble because of their guilt, and Judah will stumble along with them."
Hosea,5,6,"They will go to seek the Lord with their herds and flocks, but they will not find him, for he has given up on them."
Hosea,5,7,They have been unfaithful to the Lord and have had children that are not his. Now the New Moon will destroy them along with their fields.
Hosea,5,8,"Blow the horn in Gibeah! Sound the trumpet in Ramah! Shout an alarm in Beth-aven! Lead the way, Benjamin!"
Hosea,5,9,Ephraim will be left desolate on the day of punishment. Among the tribes of Israel I will reveal what is the real truth.
Hosea,5,10,The rulers of Judah have become thieves like those who illegally move boundaries. I will pour out my anger like water upon them.
Hosea,5,11,"The people of Ephraim are crushed, smashed to pieces in judgment because they were determined to follow human commands."
Hosea,5,12,"I am like a maggot to Ephraim, and like something rotten to the people of Judah."
Hosea,5,13,"When Ephraim saw how sick they were, and Judah saw how wounded they were, Ephraim turned to the great king of Assyria for help, but he could not heal them or cure their wounds."
Hosea,5,14,"For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, like a fierce lion to the people of Judah. I will come and tear them to pieces, and carry them off, and no one will be able to rescue them."
Hosea,5,15,"Then I will leave and return to where I came from until they acknowledge their wrongs, and in their distress they will seek my face and beg for my help.”"
Hosea,6,1,"“Come on! Let's go back to the Lord. He has torn us to pieces, but now he will heal us. He has struck us down, but now he will bind up our wounds."
Hosea,6,2,In two days he will heal us; after three days he will raise us up so we can live in his presence.
Hosea,6,3,"Let's get to know the Lord, really strive to know him, and he will appear to us as surely as the sun will rise; he will come to us as certainly as the spring rains fall on the earth.”"
Hosea,6,4,"Ephraim, what shall I do with you? Judah, what shall I do with you? Your love disappears like mist at dawn; it vanishes like dew in the morning."
Hosea,6,5,So I cut you down through the prophets; I killed you with my words. My judgment shines out like a light.
Hosea,6,6,"I want your true love, not your sacrifices; I want you to know me, not your burnt offerings."
Hosea,6,7,"But you, just like Adam, broke our agreement; there you were unfaithful to me."
Hosea,6,8,Gilead is a city of evil people where footprints are tracked in blood.
Hosea,6,9,"Priests are like a gang of bandits, lying in wait to ambush travelers on the road. They commit murder in Shechem, carrying out wicked crimes."
Hosea,6,10,I have seen in the house of Israel something totally disgusting: Ephraim engages in prostitution and Israel is sexually corrupt.
Hosea,6,11,"And as for you, Judah, your harvest-time has been set! When I restore the fortunes of my people"
Hosea,7,1,"when I heal Israel, Ephraim's sins will be exposed, together with the evil actions of Samaria. They deal in lies; they are thieves who break in to homes and who rob people on the outside."
Hosea,7,2,But they don't realize that I remember all of their wickedness. Their sins surround them and are always before me.
Hosea,7,3,"They make their king happy with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies."
Hosea,7,4,"All of them are adulterers, burning with lust like an oven whose fire stays hot, even though it is not tended by the baker, having left the dough to rise after kneading."
Hosea,7,5,"On the king's birthday the princes drink so much they are sick, while he joins in with those who mock."
Hosea,7,6,Their minds are fired up like an oven; they go to him with their plots. All through the night their anger burns; in the morning it blazes out uncontrollably.
Hosea,7,7,"All of them are as hot as a burning oven, and they exhaust their leaders. All of their kings have fallen, and not one of them calls on me."
Hosea,7,8,Ephraim mixes with the foreign nations; he is as useless as half-baked bread!
Hosea,7,9,"Foreigners drain his strength, and he doesn't even realize it. His hair is turning grey and he doesn't even notice."
Hosea,7,10,"Israel's pride testifies against him, but for all of this he still does not return to the Lord their God or look for him."
Hosea,7,11,"Ephraim is like a dove, foolish and without sense—calling to Egypt, then going to Assyria."
Hosea,7,12,When they go I will throw my net over them; I will bring them down like wild birds. When I hear them flocking together I will punish them.
Hosea,7,13,"What disaster is coming to them because they have strayed from me! Destruction is coming to them because they have rebelled against me! I wish I could redeem them, but they tell lies about me."
Hosea,7,14,"They do not cry out to me with sincere minds; instead they lie on their beds howling. They assemble together and gash themselves to gain grain and new wine, but they turn away from me."
Hosea,7,15,"I myself trained them and made them strong, but now they plot evil against me."
Hosea,7,16,"They turn, but not to the Most High; they are like a useless bow. Their leaders will be killed by the sword because of their cursing. Because of this they will be ridiculed in Egypt."
Hosea,8,1,Put a trumpet to your lips! An eagle swoops over the house of the Lord because they have broken my agreement and rebelled against my law.
Hosea,8,2,"Israel calls out to me, “Our God, we know you!”"
Hosea,8,3,But Israel has rejected what is good. An enemy will chase after them.
Hosea,8,4,They appointed kings without my consent and chose princes without my knowledge. With their silver and gold they made idols for their own destruction.
Hosea,8,5,"Samaria, I reject this calf idol you have made! My anger burns against them! How long will you be incapable of being good?"
Hosea,8,6,This idol is from Israel! A craftsman made it—it's not God! The calf of Samaria will be broken in pieces!
Hosea,8,7,"Those who sow the wind will reap the whirlwind. The stalk has no head of grain; it will produce no flour. Even if it did produce grain, foreigners would swallow it all up."
Hosea,8,8,Israel is swallowed up; among the nations they are like something nobody wants.
Hosea,8,9,They have gone up to Assyria like a donkey wandering alone. Ephraim has hired lovers.
Hosea,8,10,"Even though they have hired allies among the nations, I will gather them together. Then they will writhe under the burden of the great king."
Hosea,8,11,"Though Ephraim built many altars to make sin offerings, they instead became altars of sin!"
Hosea,8,12,"I wrote down for them the many aspects of my law, but they looked on them as foreign."
Hosea,8,13,"They present me with their sacrifices, and they eat the meat, but I, the Lord, do not accept them. Now he will remember their wickedness, and punish them for their sins. They will return to Egypt."
Hosea,8,14,"Israel has forgotten his maker, and built palaces; Judah has built many fortified cities. But I will rain fire down on their cities and burn up their fortresses."
Hosea,9,1,"Israel, don't rejoice! Don't celebrate like other nations! For you have practiced prostitution; you have loved a prostitute's wages on every threshing floor of grain."
Hosea,9,2,Your threshing floors and winepresses will not feed you; the land will fail to produce your new wine.
Hosea,9,3,"You will not stay in the Lord's land, instead Ephraim will return to Egypt, and will eat unclean food in Assyria."
Hosea,9,4,"You won't pour out any drink offerings to the Lord. None of your sacrifices will please him. Your sacrifices will be like food eaten by a person in mourning—all who eat will be unclean. You will eat this food yourselves, but it will not enter the house of the Lord."
Hosea,9,5,"What are you going to do on the days of your appointed religious feasts, on the days of the festivals of the Lord?"
Hosea,9,6,"Look, they have left because of the destruction: Egypt will with gather them, and Memphis will bury them. They gain a “valued possession” for their silver. Weeds will possess them, and thorns will grow over their tents."
Hosea,9,7,"The time of punishment has come; the day of retribution has arrived. Let Israel know! You say the prophet is a fool, the man of the Spirit is mad, because your sin and hostility is so great."
Hosea,9,8,"The watchman over Ephraim is with my God, and a prophet is a birdcatcher's snare on all his ways. Hatred is in the house of his God"
Hosea,9,9,"for they have corrupted themselves so deeply, as in the time of Gibeah. He will remember their sin; he will punish their wickedness."
Hosea,9,10,"When I found Israel, it was like finding grapes in the desert. When I saw your forefathers it was like seeing early fruit on the fig tree. But when they came to Baal Peor, they gave themselves over to that shameful idol, becoming as filthy as the filthy thing they loved."
Hosea,9,11,"Ephraim! Like a bird that flies away so shall your glory be—no births, no pregnancies, no conceptions."
Hosea,9,12,"Even if they bring up children, I will make sure they do not survive. What a disaster for you when I turn away from you!"
Hosea,9,13,"Ephraim! Just as I saw Tyre planted in a meadow, so too Ephraim will lead out his children to the murderer."
Hosea,9,14,"Give them—well, Lord, what should you give them? Give them wombs that miscarry and dry breasts."
Hosea,9,15,"All of their evil began at Gilgal, and that's where I began to hate them. I will drive them out of my house because of their wickedness. I will love them no longer; all their leaders are rebels."
Hosea,9,16,"Ephraim, you are blighted, dried up from the roots. You shall bear no fruit. Even if you have children, I will slaughter your beloved offspring."
Hosea,9,17,"My God will reject you because you have not listened to him, and you will become homeless wanderers among the nations."
Hosea,10,1,"Israel is like a spreading vine that produces fruit for itself. The more fruit they produced, the more altars they built. The more productive the land, the more beautiful they made the sacred pillars."
Hosea,10,2,"The people have minds that are deceptive, and now they must take responsibility for their guilt. The Lord will break apart their altars and destroy their sacred pillars."
Hosea,10,3,"Then they will say, “We have no king, for we do not fear the Lord, and yet what would a king do for us?”"
Hosea,10,4,"They speak empty words, swearing false promises to make a covenant. Their “justice” flourishes like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field."
Hosea,10,5,"Those who live in Samaria tremble in awe at the calf of Beth-aven. Its people mourn for it in their pagan rituals, while its idolatrous priests celebrate its glory. But it will certainly be taken away from them. It will be brought to Assyria as tribute for the great king."
Hosea,10,6,"Ephraim will be disgraced, and Israel will be ashamed at its own decisions."
Hosea,10,7,"Samaria and its king will be destroyed, swept away like a twig on the surface of the water."
Hosea,10,8,"The high places of Aven, where Israel sinned, will be demolished, and thorns and thistles will grow over their altars. Then they will call to the mountains, “Bury us!” and to the hills, “Fall on us!”"
Hosea,10,9,"Since the days of Gibeah you have been sinning, Israel, and you haven't changed. Do the people of Gibeah think that war will not come to them?"
Hosea,10,10,When I choose I will punish the wicked. The nations will be gathered together against them when they are punished for their double crime.
Hosea,10,11,"Ephraim is like a trained heifer that loved to thresh the grain, but now I will place a yoke on her strong neck. I will harness Ephraim; Judah will have to pull the plow; and Jacob must break up the ground for himself."
Hosea,10,12,Sow for yourselves what is right and you will reap unfailing love. Break up the unplowed ground. It's time to go to the Lord until he comes and rains down goodness on you.
Hosea,10,13,"But instead you have planted wickedness and reaped an evil harvest. You have eaten the fruit of lies, because you trusted in your own strength and in your many warriors."
Hosea,10,14,"The terrifying noise of battle will rise against your people, and all your fortresses will be destroyed, just as Shalman devastated Beth Arbel in the time of war. Even mothers and children were dashed to pieces."
Hosea,10,15,"This is what will happen to you, Bethel, because of your great wickedness. At dawn, the king of Israel will be utterly destroyed."
Hosea,11,1,I loved Israel when he was a child. He's my son I called out of Egypt.
Hosea,11,2,"As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed to the Baals and offered incense to idols."
Hosea,11,3,"I myself taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the hand, but they didn't realize I was the one who healed them."
Hosea,11,4,"I led them along with cords of kindness, with ropes of love. I was the one who eased their burden and bent down to feed them."
Hosea,11,5,"However, because my people refuse to return to me, they will not return to the land of Egypt but Assyria shall be their king."
Hosea,11,6,"War will sweep through their cities, putting an end to their boasting and destroying their plans."
Hosea,11,7,My people are hanging on to their apostasy from me. They call him “god on high” but he will not raise them up at all.
Hosea,11,8,"How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I let you go, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is breaking; I am full of compassion."
Hosea,11,9,"I will not execute the fierceness of my anger, I will not destroy Ephraim again. For I am God, not a human being. I am the Holy One living among you. I will not enter your cities."
Hosea,11,10,"The people will follow me, the Lord. He will roar like a lion. When he roars like a lion then his children will come trembling from the west."
Hosea,11,11,"Like a flock of frightened birds they will come from Egypt, like doves they will come from Assyria, and I will bring them back home, declares the Lord."
Hosea,11,12,"Ephraim surrounds me with lies and Israel with deceit, and Judah still wanders with some deity, faithful to some “Holy One.”"
Hosea,12,1,"Ephraim tries to herd the wind, chasing after the east wind all day long. Their lies and violence keep on increasing. They make a treaty with Assyria, and send olive oil to Egypt."
Hosea,12,2,"The Lord also has an accusation against Judah, and will punish Jacob for the way the people act; he will repay them for what they have done."
Hosea,12,3,Even in the womb he fought with his brother; when he became a man he fought with God.
Hosea,12,4,"He fought with the angel, and he won. He wept, and begged him for a blessing. Jacob found God at Bethel, and spoke with him there"
Hosea,12,5,"the Lord God Almighty, the Lord is his memorable name!"
Hosea,12,6,"You must return to your God. Act lovingly and do what is right, and always wait for your God."
Hosea,12,7,A merchant who holds in his hands dishonest scales loves to swindle.
Hosea,12,8,"Ephraim says, “I'm rich! I've made myself wealthy! I've made so much from my work, and nobody can prove me guilty of doing wrong.”"
Hosea,12,9,But I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt. I will make you live again in tents like you do at the time of that particular festival.
Hosea,12,10,I spoke through the prophets. I myself gave many visions and parables through the prophets.
Hosea,12,11,"If Gilead is idolatrous, they will surely come to nothing. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls. Even their altars are like heaps of rocks in the furrows of the field."
Hosea,12,12,"Jacob fled to the land of Aram; Israel worked there to gain a wife, earning a wife by looking after sheep."
Hosea,12,13,"Through a prophet the Lord brought Israel up from Egypt, and by a prophet they were cared for."
Hosea,12,14,"Ephraim has really upset the Lord, and the Lord will let them have the consequences of their bloodshed and pay them back for their contempt."
Hosea,13,1,"When Ephraim spoke, they were feared, for they were the leading tribe in Israel. But when they were guilty of Baal worship, they died."
Hosea,13,2,"Now they constantly sin, making for themselves idols from molten metal. All of these idols are skillfully made from silver by their craftsmen. “Offer sacrifices to these idols,” say the people. “Kiss the bull calf idols.”"
Hosea,13,3,"Consequently they will be like the morning mist, like early morning dew, like chaff blowing away from the threshing floor, like smoke from a chimney."
Hosea,13,4,Yet I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt. You shall know no other gods but me. None can save you except me.
Hosea,13,5,I looked after you in the wilderness; in that dry desert land it was like pasture to them
Hosea,13,6,"and they were satisfied. But when they were satisfied they became arrogant, and they forgot me."
Hosea,13,7,"So I will be like a lion to them, like a leopard I will lie in wait beside the path."
Hosea,13,8,"I will be like a mother bear whose cubs have been taken, I will rip out their hearts. I shall devour them like a lion, like a wild beast I will tear them apart."
Hosea,13,9,"You have destroyed yourselves, Israel, for your only help is in me."
Hosea,13,10,Where then is your king? Let him save you in all your cities! Where are your leaders who demanded a king and princes from me?
Hosea,13,11,"In my anger I give you a king, and in my fury I take one."
Hosea,13,12,Ephraim's guilt is packed up; their sin will be eradicated.
Hosea,13,13,"The pain of childbirth has come to them, trying to give birth to a son who is not “wise” because he is not in the right position when the time comes."
Hosea,13,14,"I shall redeem them from the power of Sheol; I shall deliver them from death. Where, death, are your plagues? Where, Sheol, is your destruction? Compassion is hidden from my sight."
Hosea,13,15,"Even though they flourish among the reeds, an east wind will come, a wind from the Lord that rises in the desert will dry up their springs and their wells will fail. It will rob from their treasury everything of value."
Hosea,13,16,"The people of Samaria will have to bear the consequences of their guilt, because they rebelled against their God. They will be slaughtered by the sword; their children will be dashed to the ground; their pregnant women will be ripped open."
Hosea,14,1,"Return, Israel, to the Lord your God, because your sins have brought you down."
Hosea,14,2,"Take words like these with you and come back to the Lord, saying to him, “Please take away all our guilt, accept what is good, and we will repay you with praise from our lips."
Hosea,14,3,"Assyria can't save us; we will not ride our warhorses; we will never again say, ‘You are our gods’ to the idols we have made. For in you orphans find mercy.”"
Hosea,14,4,"I will heal their unfaithfulness; I will love them freely, for I'm not angry with them any longer."
Hosea,14,5,"I will be like the dew to Israel, they will blossom like lilies, they will send down roots like the cedars of Lebanon."
Hosea,14,6,"They will send out new shoots, their splendor will be like the olive tree, and their scent will be like the cedars of Lebanon."
Hosea,14,7,"Those who live under their shade willll return, they will flourish like grain, they will blossom like the vine, and they will be as famous as the wine of Lebanon."
Hosea,14,8,"Ephraim, how much more do I have to warn you about idols? I have answered and now I am watching. I am like a tree that is evergreen; your fruit is found in me."
Hosea,14,9,"Who is wise to understand these things? Who has discernment in understanding them? The Lord's paths are right—the good follow them, but rebels trip and fall along the way."
