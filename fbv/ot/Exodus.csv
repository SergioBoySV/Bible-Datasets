Exodus,1,1,These were the names of the sons of Israel (Jacob) who came with him to Egypt along with their families
Exodus,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah"
Exodus,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin"
Exodus,1,4,"Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher."
Exodus,1,5,"Jacob had 70 descendants there, including Joseph who was already in Egypt."
Exodus,1,6,Eventually Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died.
Exodus,1,7,"However, the Israelites had many children and their numbers increased rapidly. In fact there were so many of them that they became very powerful—the country was full of them."
Exodus,1,8,Then a new king came to power who didn't know anything about Joseph.
Exodus,1,9,"He conferred with his fellow Egyptians and said, “Look at these Israelites—there are more of them than us, and they're more powerful than us."
Exodus,1,10,"Let's deal wisely with them before they become so many that if there's a war they'll side with our enemies and fight us, and flee the country.”"
Exodus,1,11,So the Egyptians made them do forced labor and put taskmasters in charge of them. They used them to build the storage towns of Pithom and Rameses.
Exodus,1,12,"But the more the Israelites were mistreated, the more they grew in numbers and spread out—and the more the Egyptians detested them."
Exodus,1,13,The Egyptians worked the Israelites brutally
Exodus,1,14,"making their lives a misery. They made them do hard labor, building with mortar and brick, and all kinds of heavy work in the fields. In all of this hard labor they treated them brutally."
Exodus,1,15,"Then the king gave orders to the Hebrew midwives, Shiphrah and Puah."
Exodus,1,16,"He told them, “When you assist the Hebrew women during childbirth, if you see it's a boy, kill him; but if it's a girl, let her live.”"
Exodus,1,17,"But because the midwives revered God, they didn't do what the king of Egypt had ordered. They let the boys live as well."
Exodus,1,18,"The king of Egypt called the midwives in and demanded to know, “Why have you done this— letting the male children live?”"
Exodus,1,19,"“Hebrew women aren't like Egyptian women,” the midwives told Pharaoh. “They give birth more easily—they have them before we midwives arrive.”"
Exodus,1,20,"God treated the midwives well, and the people increased in number so there were even more of them."
Exodus,1,21,"Because the midwives revered God, he gave them families of their own."
Exodus,1,22,"Then Pharaoh issued this order to all his people: “Throw every Hebrew boy that's born into the Nile, but let every girl live.”"
Exodus,2,1,"It was around this time that a man from the tribe of Levi married a woman, also a Levite."
Exodus,2,2,"She became pregnant and had a son. She saw he was a lovely baby, and she hid him for three months."
Exodus,2,3,"But when she couldn't hide him anymore, she got a papyrus basket and covered it with tar and pitch. Then she put her baby in the basket and placed it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile."
Exodus,2,4,"His sister waited some distance away, keeping an eye on him."
Exodus,2,5,"Then Pharaoh's daughter arrived to bathe in the Nile. Her ladies-in-waiting were walking along the bank of the river. When she saw the basket among the reeds, she sent her maid to get it and bring it to her."
Exodus,2,6,"When she opened it she saw the baby boy. He was crying and she felt sorry for him. “This must be one of the Hebrew boys,” she said."
Exodus,2,7,"His sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, “Would you like me to go and find one of the Hebrew women to nurse him for you?”"
Exodus,2,8,"“Yes, go and do that,” she replied. So the girl went and called the baby's mother to come."
Exodus,2,9,"“Take this baby boy and nurse him for me,” Pharaoh's daughter told his mother. “I will pay you myself.” So his mother took him home and nursed him."
Exodus,2,10,"When the boy was older she took him to Pharaoh's daughter, who adopted him as her son. She called him Moses, because she said, “I pulled him out of the water.”"
Exodus,2,11,"Later, when Moses had grown up, he went to visit his people, the Hebrews. He saw them doing hard labor. He also saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people."
Exodus,2,12,"He looked all around to make sure no one was watching, and then he killed the Egyptian and buried his body in the sand."
Exodus,2,13,"The following day he went back and he saw two Hebrews fighting with each other. He said to the one at fault, “Why are you beating one of your own people?”"
Exodus,2,14,"“Who put you in charge to judge us?” the man replied. “Are you going to kill me like you did the Egyptian?” Moses became frightened at this, and said to himself, “People know what I've done!”"
Exodus,2,15,"When Pharaoh found out, he tried to have Moses killed, but Moses ran away from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian.
One day as he was sitting by a well"
Exodus,2,16,the Midianite priest's seven daughters came to fetch water to fill up the troughs so their father's flock could drink.
Exodus,2,17,"Some shepherds arrived and chased them off, but Moses intervened and rescued them, and watered their flock."
Exodus,2,18,"When they got home, their father Reuel asked them, “How did you get back so quickly today?”"
Exodus,2,19,"“An Egyptian rescued us from some shepherds who attacked us,” they replied. “Then he even fetched water for us so the flock could drink.”"
Exodus,2,20,"“So where is he?” Reuel asked his daughters. “You didn't just leave him there, did you? Go and invite him to eat with us!”"
Exodus,2,21,"Moses agreed to stay with the man, who arranged for his daughter Zipporah to marry Moses."
Exodus,2,22,"She had a son, and Moses named him Gershom, for he said, “I'm an exile living in a foreign country.”"
Exodus,2,23,"Years later, the king of Egypt died. But the Israelites were still groaning under their hard labor. Their cries for help because of their hardship reached God."
Exodus,2,24,"God heard their groans, and recalled his agreement with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
Exodus,2,25,"God also looked sympathetically on the Israelites, and was concerned for them."
Exodus,3,1,"Moses was a shepherd, looking after the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the Midianite priest. He led the flock far into the wilderness until he came to God's mountain, Mount Horeb."
Exodus,3,2,"There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from inside a bush. Moses looked carefully and saw that though the bush was on fire, it wasn't being burned up."
Exodus,3,3,"“Let me go over and take a look,” Moses said to himself. “It's very odd to see a bush that's not burning up.”"
Exodus,3,4,"When the Lord saw that Moses was coming to take a look, God called to him from inside the bush, “Moses! Moses!”
“I'm here,” Moses replied."
Exodus,3,5,“Don't come any closer!” God told him. “Take off your sandals because you're standing on holy ground.”
Exodus,3,6,"Then he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Moses covered his face, because he was afraid to look at God."
Exodus,3,7,"“I'm completely aware of the misery of my people in Egypt,” the Lord told him. “I have heard them crying out because of their taskmasters. I know how much they're suffering."
Exodus,3,8,"That's why I have come down to rescue them from Egyptian oppression and to take them up from that country to a productive, wide-open land—a land flowing with milk and honey—where currently the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites are living."
Exodus,3,9,"Listen! The cries of the Israelites have reached me, and I have seen how badly the Egyptians are mistreating them."
Exodus,3,10,"Now you must leave, because I'm sending you to Pharaoh to lead my people Israel out of Egypt.”"
Exodus,3,11,"But Moses said to God, “Why me? I'm a nobody! I couldn't go to Pharaoh and lead the Israelites out of Egypt!”"
Exodus,3,12,"“I'll be with you,” the Lord replied, “and this will be the sign that it is really me who is sending you: when you have led the people out of Egypt, you will worship God at this very mountain.”"
Exodus,3,13,"Then Moses said to God, “Look! If I were to go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ —then what should I tell them?”"
Exodus,3,14,"God replied to Moses, “‘I Am’ is who I am. Tell the Israelites this: ‘I Am’ has sent me to you.”"
Exodus,3,15,"Then God said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘The Lord—the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you. This is my name forever, the name you are to call me for all generations to come.’"
Exodus,3,16,"Go, and call all the elders of Israel to meet with you. Tell them, ‘The Lord, the God of your fathers, has appeared to me—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He said, “I have paid close attention to what's been happening to you in Egypt."
Exodus,3,17,"I have decided to take you away from the misery you're having in Egypt and bring you to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey.”"
Exodus,3,18,"“The elders of Israel will accept what you say. Then you must go with them to the king of Egypt and tell him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews has revealed himself to us. So please let us go three days journey into the desert so we can offer sacrifices to the Lord our God there.’"
Exodus,3,19,But I know that the king of Egypt won't let you go unless he's forced to do so by a power stronger than him.
Exodus,3,20,So I will use my power to inflict on Egypt all the terrifying things that I'm about to do to them. After that he'll let you go.
Exodus,3,21,"I will make the Egyptians treat you well as a people, so when you go you won't leave empty-handed."
Exodus,3,22,"Every woman will ask her neighbor as well as any woman living in her house for silver and gold jewelry and clothing, and put them on your sons and daughters. In this way you will take the wealth of the Egyptians with you.”"
Exodus,4,1,"“But what if they don't believe me or listen to what I say?” Moses asked. “They could say, ‘The Lord didn't appear to you.’”"
Exodus,4,2,"The Lord asked him, “What are you holding in your hand?”
“A walking stick,” Moses replied."
Exodus,4,3,"“Throw it on the ground,” he told Moses. So Moses did. It turned into a snake and Moses ran away from it."
Exodus,4,4,"“Reach out and grab hold of it by its tail,” the Lord told Moses. Moses did so and it turned back into a walking stick in his hand."
Exodus,4,5,"“You are to do this so that they will believe that I the Lord did appear to you, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”"
Exodus,4,6,"Then the Lord told him, “Put your hand inside your clothes close to your chest.” So Moses did as he was told. When he took his hand out, it was white like snow with a skin disease."
Exodus,4,7,"“Now put your hand back inside your clothes,” the Lord said. Moses did so. When he took it out again, his hand had returned to normal."
Exodus,4,8,"“If they don't believe you and they're not convinced by the first sign, they'll believe because of the second sign,” the Lord explained."
Exodus,4,9,"“But if they still don't believe you or listen to you because of these two signs, then you are to take some water from the Nile and pour it out on the ground. The Nile water will turn into blood on the ground.”"
Exodus,4,10,"Then Moses said to the Lord, “Please excuse me, but I'm not someone who is good with words—not in the past, and not from the time you have been speaking with me, your servant. My speech is slow and I don't say things well.”"
Exodus,4,11,"“Who gave people mouths?” the Lord asked him. “Who makes people deaf or dumb, able to see or blind? It's I, the Lord, who does that."
Exodus,4,12,"Now go, and I myself will be your mouth, and I will tell you what you are to say.”"
Exodus,4,13,"“Please, Lord, send someone else!” Moses responded."
Exodus,4,14,"The Lord got angry with Moses, and told him, “There's your brother Aaron, the Levite. I know he speaks well. He's on his way to meet you, and he'll be very happy to see you."
Exodus,4,15,"Speak to him and tell him what to say. I will be your mouth and his mouth, and I will tell you what you are to do."
Exodus,4,16,"Aaron will speak on your behalf to the people, as if he was your mouth, and you will be in the place of God to him."
Exodus,4,17,Make sure to take your walking stick with you so you can use it to do the signs.”
Exodus,4,18,"Then Moses returned to Jethro his father-in-law and told him, “Please allow me to go back to my own people in Egypt so I can see if any of them are still alive.”
“Go with my blessing,” Jethro replied."
Exodus,4,19,"While Moses was in Midian, the Lord told him, “Go back to Egypt because all those who wanted to kill you have died.”"
Exodus,4,20,"Moses put his wife and sons on a donkey and went back to Egypt, carrying the walking stick that God had used to perform miracles."
Exodus,4,21,"The Lord told Moses, “When you get back to Egypt, make sure to go to Pharaoh and carry out the miracles I've given you to do. I will make him stubborn and he will not let the people go."
Exodus,4,22,"This is what you are to tell Pharaoh, ‘This is what the Lord says. Israel is my firstborn son."
Exodus,4,23,"I ordered you to let my son go so he can worship me. But you refused to release him, so I will now kill your firstborn son.’”"
Exodus,4,24,"But while they were on their way the Lord came to the place where they were staying, wanting to kill Moses."
Exodus,4,25,"However, Zipporah used a flint knife to cut off her son's foreskin. She touched his feet with it, and said to him, “You are a blood-husband to me.”"
Exodus,4,26,(Calling him a blood-husband referred to circumcision.) After this the Lord left Moses alone.
Exodus,4,27,"The Lord had told Aaron, “Go and meet Moses in the desert.” So Aaron went and met Moses at the mountain of God and greeted him with a kiss."
Exodus,4,28,Then Moses explained to Aaron everything the Lord had sent him to say and all the miracles he had ordered him to do.
Exodus,4,29,Moses and Aaron traveled to Egypt. There they had all the Israelite elders gather together.
Exodus,4,30,"Aaron shared with them everything the Lord had told Moses, and Moses carried out the miracles so they could see them."
Exodus,4,31,"The Israelites were convinced. When they heard that the Lord had come to them, and that he had been touched by their suffering, they bowed their heads and worshiped."
Exodus,5,1,"After this Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and told him, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says, ‘Let my people go so they can hold a religious festival for me in the desert.’”"
Exodus,5,2,“Who is this ‘Lord’ that I should listen to his request to let Israel go?” Pharaoh replied. “I don't know the Lord and I certainly won't let Israel leave!”
Exodus,5,3,"“The God of the Hebrews came to us,” they added. “Please allow us to go a three-day journey into the desert and offer sacrifices to the Lord our God. Otherwise he'll kill us by disease or by the sword.”"
Exodus,5,4,"“Moses and Aaron, why are you trying to take people away from their assigned labor?” Pharaoh asked. “Get back to work!” he ordered."
Exodus,5,5,"“Look here,” he went on. “There are many of your people here in our country and you are preventing them from doing their assigned labor.”"
Exodus,5,6,That very day he ordered the slave drivers and those in charge of the people
Exodus,5,7,“Don't give them any more straw to make bricks like before. Have them go and collect the straw themselves.
Exodus,5,8,"But still make them produce the same quantity of bricks as before. They're lazy people—that's why they're calling out, asking, ‘Please let us go and offer sacrifices to our god.’"
Exodus,5,9,Make their work harder so they can get on with it and not pay any attention to all these lies!”
Exodus,5,10,"So the slave drivers and those in charge went out and told the people, “This is what Pharaoh has ordered: ‘I won't give you any more straw."
Exodus,5,11,"Go and get straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, because your work quota won't be reduced.’”"
Exodus,5,12,So the people went all over Egypt collecting stubble for straw.
Exodus,5,13,"The slave drivers kept on forcing them, saying, “You still have to do the same work as you did when you had straw provided!”"
Exodus,5,14,"They beat the Israelite supervisors they had put in charge, shouting at them, “Why haven't you met your quota of bricks as you did before?”"
Exodus,5,15,"The Israelite supervisors went to Pharaoh to complain, saying, “Why are you treating us your servants like this?"
Exodus,5,16,"You don't give us any straw but your slave drivers demand that we make bricks, and they beat us! Your people are treating us badly!”"
Exodus,5,17,"“No, you're just lazy, lazy people!” Pharaoh replied. “That's why you keep on asking, ‘Please let us go and offer sacrifices to the Lord.’"
Exodus,5,18,Now get out of here and go back to work! You won't be given any straw but you'll still have to produce the full quota of bricks!”
Exodus,5,19,"The Israelite supervisors realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You must not reduce the daily production of bricks.”"
Exodus,5,20,They went over to Moses and Aaron who were waiting for them after their meeting with Pharaoh
Exodus,5,21,"and said, “May the Lord see what you have done and judge you accordingly! You have made us like a bad smell to Pharaoh and his officials. You have put a sword in their hands to kill us!”"
Exodus,5,22,"Moses went back to the Lord and complained, “Why have you caused all this trouble for your own people, Lord? Was this why you sent me?"
Exodus,5,23,"Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak for you, he has been even harder on your people, and you haven't done anything to save them!”"
Exodus,6,1,"But the Lord told Moses, “Now you'll see what I'm going to do to Pharaoh. Using my great strength I will force him to let them go; because of my power he will send them out from his country.”"
Exodus,6,2,"God spoke to Moses and told him, “I am Yahweh!"
Exodus,6,3,"I revealed myself as God Almighty to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, but they didn't know my name, ‘Yahweh.’"
Exodus,6,4,"I also confirmed my solemn agreement with them to give them the land of Canaan, the country where they were living as foreigners."
Exodus,6,5,"In addition I've heard the groans of the Israelites that the Egyptians are treating as slaves, and I haven't forgotten the agreement I promised them."
Exodus,6,6,"So tell the Israelites, ‘I am the Lord and I will save you from the forced labor the Egyptians are making you do; I will set you free from being their slaves. I will rescue you using my power and imposing heavy punishments."
Exodus,6,7,"I will make you my own people. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God, who rescued you from slavery in Egypt."
Exodus,6,8,"I will take you to the land that I solemnly promised to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you to own. I am the Lord!’”"
Exodus,6,9,"Moses explained this to the Israelites but they did not listen to him, because they were so discouraged and because of the hard labor they were forced to do."
Exodus,6,10,Then the Lord said to Moses
Exodus,6,11,"“Go and speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Tell him to let the Israelites leave his country.”"
Exodus,6,12,"But Moses replied, “Even my own people don't listen to me. Why would Pharaoh listen to me, especially since I'm such a poor speaker?”"
Exodus,6,13,"But the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, and told them what to do regarding the people of Israel and Pharaoh, king of Egypt, in order to bring the Israelites out of Egypt."
Exodus,6,14,"These were the Israelite family heads. The sons of Reuben, the firstborn son of Israel, were Hanok and Pallu, Hezron and Karmi. These were the families of Reuben."
Exodus,6,15,"The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul (the son of a Canaanite woman). These were the families of Simeon."
Exodus,6,16,"These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their genealogical records: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Levi lived for 137 years."
Exodus,6,17,"The sons of Gershon, by families, were Libni and Shimei."
Exodus,6,18,"The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath lived for 133 years."
Exodus,6,19,The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the families of the Levites according to their genealogical records.
Exodus,6,20,"Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, and she had their sons Aaron and Moses. Amram lived for 137 years."
Exodus,6,21,"The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri."
Exodus,6,22,"The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri."
Exodus,6,23,"Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon. She had their sons Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar."
Exodus,6,24,"The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These were the Korahite families."
Exodus,6,25,"Eleazar, son of Aaron, married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she had their son Phinehas. These are the ancestors of the Levite families, listed according to their clans. Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she gave birth to his son, Phinehas. These are the heads of the Levite families, listed by family."
Exodus,6,26,"Aaron and Moses mentioned here are the ones the Lord told, “Lead the Israelites out of Egypt, divided up in their respective tribes.”"
Exodus,6,27,"Moses and Aaron were also the ones who went to speak with Pharaoh, king of Egypt, about the Israelites leaving Egypt."
Exodus,6,28,When the Lord spoke to Moses in Egypt
Exodus,6,29,"he said to him, “I am the Lord. Tell Pharaoh, king of Egypt, all that I tell you.”"
Exodus,6,30,"But Moses replied, “I'm not a good speaker—why would Pharaoh listen to me?”"
Exodus,7,1,"The Lord told Moses, “Look, I will make you seem like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet."
Exodus,7,2,"You are to repeat everything that I tell you to say, and your brother Aaron must repeat it to Pharaoh so that he will let the Israelites leave his country."
Exodus,7,3,"But I will give Pharaoh a stubborn attitude, and though I will perform many signs and wonders in Egypt, he won't listen to you."
Exodus,7,4,"Then I will attack Egypt, imposing heavy punishments on them, and I will lead out by their tribes my people the Israelites."
Exodus,7,5,In this way the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord—when I take action against Egypt and lead the Israelites out of the country.”
Exodus,7,6,Moses and Aaron did exactly as the Lord had ordered.
Exodus,7,7,Moses was eighty and Aaron was eighty-three when they went and spoke to Pharaoh.
Exodus,7,8,The Lord told Moses and Aaron
Exodus,7,9,"“When Pharaoh asks you, ‘Why don't you perform a miracle, then?’ tell Aaron, ‘Take your walking stick and throw it down in front of Pharaoh,’ and it will turn into a snake.”"
Exodus,7,10,"Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did what the Lord had ordered. Aaron threw down his staff in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it turned into a snake."
Exodus,7,11,"But Pharaoh called in wise men and sorcerers, and these Egyptian magicians did the same thing using their magic arts."
Exodus,7,12,"Each of them threw down their walking sticks and they also turned into snakes, but Aaron's walking stick swallowed up all their walking sticks."
Exodus,7,13,"But Pharaoh had a hard, stubborn attitude, and he wouldn't listen to them, as the Lord had predicted."
Exodus,7,14,"The Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh has a stubborn attitude—he's refusing to let the people go."
Exodus,7,15,So tomorrow morning go to Pharaoh as he walks down to the river. Wait to meet him on the bank of the Nile. Take with you the walking stick that turned into a snake.
Exodus,7,16,"Tell him: The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you, ‘Let my people go, so that they can worship me in the desert. But you have not listened up until now."
Exodus,7,17,"This is what the Lord is now telling you: This is how you will know that I am the Lord.’”
“Watch! Using the walking stick I'm holding, I'm going to hit the water of the Nile, and it will turn to blood."
Exodus,7,18,"The fish in the Nile will die, the river will smell, and the Egyptians won't be able to drink any of its water.”"
Exodus,7,19,"The Lord said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Take your walking stick in your hand and hold it out over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers and canals and ponds and pools, so that they will turn to blood. There will be blood through all of Egypt, even in containers made of wood and stone.’”"
Exodus,7,20,"Moses and Aaron did exactly as the Lord had ordered. While Pharaoh and all his officials watched, Aaron lifted up his walking stick and hit the water of the Nile. Immediately the whole river turned to blood!"
Exodus,7,21,"The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so awful that the Egyptians could not drink its water. There was blood through all of Egypt!"
Exodus,7,22,"But the Egyptian magicians did the same thing using their magic arts. Pharaoh maintained his stubborn attitude and he wouldn't listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had predicted."
Exodus,7,23,Pharaoh went back to his palace and didn't pay any attention to what had happened.
Exodus,7,24,All the Egyptians dug alongside the Nile because they couldn't drink its water.
Exodus,7,25,Seven days went by after the Lord hit the Nile.
Exodus,8,1,"Then the Lord told Moses, “Go and see Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord says: Let my people go, so that they can worship me."
Exodus,8,2,"If you refuse to let them leave, I will send a plague of frogs all over your country."
Exodus,8,3,"They will swarm out of the Nile, and they will enter your palace and get into your bedroom and jump onto your bed. They will get into the houses of your officials and jump around your people—even into your ovens and breadmaking bowls."
Exodus,8,4,"Frogs will jump all over you, your people, and all your officials.’”"
Exodus,8,5,"The Lord said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Hold out your walking stick in your hand over the rivers and canals and ponds, and make frogs spread over Egypt.’”"
Exodus,8,6,"So Aaron held out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and frogs came up and covered the land."
Exodus,8,7,But the Egyptian magicians did the same thing using their magic arts. They brought up frogs in Egypt.
Exodus,8,8,"Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and pleaded with them, “Pray to the Lord, and ask him to take away the frogs from me and my people. Then I will let your people go so they can offer sacrifices to the Lord.”"
Exodus,8,9,"“You may have the honor of deciding when I'll pray for you, your officials, and your people that the frogs will be removed from you and your houses. They will remain only in the Nile.”"
Exodus,8,10,"“Do it tomorrow,” Pharaoh replied.
Moses said, “It will happen as you have requested so you will know that there is no one like the Lord our God."
Exodus,8,11,"The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people, and they will remain only in the Nile.”"
Exodus,8,12,"Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, and Moses pleaded with the Lord about the frogs he had sent against Pharaoh."
Exodus,8,13,"The Lord did as Moses asked. The frogs in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields died."
Exodus,8,14,"The people collected them in pile upon pile, and the whole country smelled terrible."
Exodus,8,15,"But when Pharaoh realized the plague had passed, he chose to become hard and stubborn again, and wouldn't listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had predicted."
Exodus,8,16,"The Lord said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Pick up your walking stick and hit the dust of the ground. The dust will become gnats swarming all over Egypt.’”"
Exodus,8,17,"They did what the Lord said. When Aaron lifted up his walking stick and hit the dust of the earth, gnats swarmed over both people and animals. The dust in the whole of Egypt turned into gnats."
Exodus,8,18,"The magicians also tried to make gnats using their magic arts, but they couldn't. The gnats stayed on both people and animals."
Exodus,8,19,"“This is an act of God,” the magicians told Pharaoh. But Pharaoh chose to be stubbornly hard-hearted, and he wouldn't listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had predicted."
Exodus,8,20,"The Lord told Moses, “Tomorrow morning get up early and block Pharaoh's way as he walks down to the river. Tell him, ‘This is what the Lord says: Let my people go, so that they can worship me."
Exodus,8,21,"If you don't let my people leave, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, and on your people and your houses. Every Egyptian house and even the ground on which they stand will be filled with swarms of flies."
Exodus,8,22,"However, on this occasion I will treat the land of Goshen differently—that's where my people live—there won't be any swarms of flies there. This is how you will know that I, the Lord, am here in your country."
Exodus,8,23,I will distinguish my people from your people. You will see this sign that confirms it tomorrow.’”
Exodus,8,24,The Lord did what he had said. Huge swarms of flies swept into Pharaoh's palace and into the houses of his officials. The whole of Egypt was devastated because of these swarms of flies.
Exodus,8,25,"Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and told them, “Go and offer sacrifices to your God here in this country.”"
Exodus,8,26,"“No, that wouldn't be the right thing to do,” Moses replied. “The sacrifices we offer to the Lord our God would be offensive to Egyptians. If we went ahead and offered sacrifices offensive to Egyptians, they'd stone us!"
Exodus,8,27,We must make a three-day journey into the wilderness and offer sacrifices there to the Lord our God as he has told us.”
Exodus,8,28,"“I'll let you go and offer sacrifices to the Lord your God in the desert, but don't go very far,” Pharaoh answered. “Now pray for me that this plague ends.”"
Exodus,8,29,"“As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the Lord,” Moses replied, “and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people. But Pharaoh should be sure not to be deceitful again and refuse to let the people go and offer sacrifices to the Lord.”"
Exodus,8,30,Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord
Exodus,8,31,"and the Lord did as Moses asked, and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh and his officials and his people. Not a single fly remained."
Exodus,8,32,But once again Pharaoh chose to be stubbornly hard-hearted and would not let the people leave.
Exodus,9,1,"The Lord told Moses, “Go and speak to Pharaoh. Tell him, ‘This is what the Lord says: Let my people go, so that they can worship me."
Exodus,9,2,If you refuse to let them go and keep holding on to them
Exodus,9,3,"I will punish you by bringing a very severe plague on your livestock—on your horses, donkeys, camels, herds, and flocks."
Exodus,9,4,"But the Lord will distinguish between the livestock of the Israelites and the Egyptians, so that none of those belonging to the Israelites will die."
Exodus,9,5,"The Lord has set a time, saying, Tomorrow this is what is going to happen here in the country.’”"
Exodus,9,6,"The following day the Lord did what he had said. All the Egyptians' livestock died, but not a single animal belonging to the Israelites died."
Exodus,9,7,"Pharaoh sent out officials and discovered that not a single one of the Israelites' livestock had died. But Pharaoh was stubborn, and he would not let the people leave."
Exodus,9,8,"The Lord told Moses and Aaron, “Go and get some handfuls of soot from a furnace. Then have Moses throw it into the air in front of Pharaoh."
Exodus,9,9,"It will spread like fine dust over the whole country of Egypt, and open sores will break out on people and animals throughout the land.”"
Exodus,9,10,"They got soot from a furnace, and went to see Pharaoh. Moses threw it into the air, and open sores broke out on people and animals."
Exodus,9,11,"The magicians were unable to come and appear before Moses, because they and all the other Egyptians were covered in sores."
Exodus,9,12,"But the Lord gave Pharaoh a stubborn attitude, and he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had told Moses."
Exodus,9,13,"The Lord told Moses, “Tomorrow morning get up early and go to Pharaoh, and tell him that this is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘Let my people go, so that they can worship me."
Exodus,9,14,"This time I will direct all my plagues against you and your officials and your people, so you will realize that there is no one like me in all the earth."
Exodus,9,15,By now I could have reached out to strike you and your people with a plague that would have completely destroyed you.
Exodus,9,16,"However, I have let you live so you can see my power, and that my reputation may be spread throughout the earth."
Exodus,9,17,"But in your pride you are still tyrannizing my people, and refuse to let them leave."
Exodus,9,18,"So watch out! About this time tomorrow I will send down the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the beginning of its history until now."
Exodus,9,19,So order your livestock and everything you have in the field to be brought inside. Every person and every animal that stays outside and is not brought inside will die when the hail falls on them.’”
Exodus,9,20,Those of Pharaoh's officials who took seriously what the Lord said rushed to bring their servants and livestock inside.
Exodus,9,21,But those who didn't care what the Lord said left their servants and livestock outside.
Exodus,9,22,"The Lord told Moses, “Lift your hand towards the sky so that a hailstorm will fall over the whole of Egypt, on people and on animals, and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt.”"
Exodus,9,23,"Moses held up his staff toward heaven, and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and made lightning hit the ground. This is how the Lord rained hail down on Egypt."
Exodus,9,24,As the hail fell it was accompanied by lightning flashing back and forth. The hail that fell was so severe that nothing like it had ever been seen in the whole of Egypt since the beginning of its history.
Exodus,9,25,"All across Egypt hail hit everything in the fields, both people and animals. It knocked down everything growing in the fields, and stripped every tree bare."
Exodus,9,26,Only in the land of Goshen where the Israelites lived was there no hail.
Exodus,9,27,"Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and told them, “I admit that I sinned this time! The Lord is right, and I and my people are wrong!"
Exodus,9,28,"Pray to the Lord for us, because there's been more than enough of God's thunder and hail. I will let you leave. You don't need to stay here any longer.”"
Exodus,9,29,"“Once I've left the city, I will pray to the Lord for you,” Moses told him. “The thunder will stop, and there'll be no more hail, so that you will realize that the earth belongs to the Lord."
Exodus,9,30,But I know you and your officials still do not really respect the Lord our God.”
Exodus,9,31,"(The flax and barley were destroyed, because the barley was ripe and the flax was flowering."
Exodus,9,32,"However, the wheat and the spelt were not destroyed because they grow later.)"
Exodus,9,33,"Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city, and prayed to the Lord. The thunder and hail stopped, and the rainstorm finished."
Exodus,9,34,"When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped, he sinned again, and he chose to become stubborn again, along with his officials."
Exodus,9,35,"Because of his stubborn attitude, Pharaoh would not let the Israelites leave, just as the Lord had predicted through Moses."
Exodus,10,1,"The Lord told Moses, “Go and see Pharaoh, because it was me who gave him and his officials a stubborn attitude so that I may perform my miracles before them."
Exodus,10,2,"This is so you can tell your children and grandchildren how I made the Egyptians look foolish by doing these miracles among them, and so that you may know that I am the Lord.”"
Exodus,10,3,"Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and told him, “This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘How long are you going to refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they can worship me."
Exodus,10,4,"If you refuse to let my people leave, tomorrow I will send a plague of locusts into your country."
Exodus,10,5,"There will be so many of them that they'll cover the ground so no one can see it. They will eat whatever crops were left by the hail, as well as every tree growing in your fields."
Exodus,10,6,They will swarm into your houses and into the houses of all your officials—in fact into the houses of every Egyptian. This is something that none of your forefathers ever saw from the time they arrived in this country.’” Then Moses and Aaron turned and left Pharaoh.
Exodus,10,7,"Pharaoh's officials came to him and asked, “How long are you going to let this man cause us trouble? Let these people go so they can worship the Lord their God. Don't you realize that Egypt has been destroyed?”"
Exodus,10,8,"Moses and Aaron were brought back to see Pharaoh. “Go and worship the Lord your God,” he told them. “But who of you will be going?”"
Exodus,10,9,"“We will all go,” Moses replied. “Young and old, sons and daughters—and we'll take our flocks and herds with us, for we're going to have a religious festival for the Lord.”"
Exodus,10,10,“The Lord really would have to be with you if I let your children go with you!” Pharaoh answered. “Clearly you're planning some kind of evil trick!
Exodus,10,11,"So no! Only the men can go and worship the Lord, because that's what you've been asking for.” Then he had Moses and Aaron thrown out."
Exodus,10,12,"The Lord told Moses, “Lift up your hand over Egypt, so that the locusts may swarm over it and eat every plant in the country—everything that was left by the hail.”"
Exodus,10,13,"Moses held out his staff over Egypt, and all through that day and night the Lord sent an east wind blowing over the land. By the time morning came the east wind had brought in the locusts."
Exodus,10,14,"The locusts swarmed across the land and settled in every part of the country. There had never been such a swarm of locusts ever before, and there won't be ever again."
Exodus,10,15,"They covered the ground until it looked black, and they ate up all the plants in the fields and all the fruit on the trees that had been left by the hail. Not a single green leaf was left on any tree or plant anywhere in Egypt."
Exodus,10,16,"Pharaoh called urgently for Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the Lord your God and against you."
Exodus,10,17,"So please forgive my sin just this one time and plead with the Lord your God, asking him to at least take away this deathly plague from me.”"
Exodus,10,18,Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord.
Exodus,10,19,The Lord changed the direction of the wind so that a strong westerly wind blew the locusts into the Red Sea. There wasn't a single locust left anywhere in Egypt.
Exodus,10,20,"But the Lord made Pharaoh stubborn, and he would not let the Israelites go."
Exodus,10,21,"The Lord told Moses, “Lift your hand toward the sky so that darkness will fall over Egypt, darkness so thick that it can be felt.”"
Exodus,10,22,"Moses lifted up his hand toward heaven, and the whole of Egypt went completely dark for three days."
Exodus,10,23,"No one could see anyone else, and no one moved from where they were for three days. But there was still light where all the Israelites lived."
Exodus,10,24,"Eventually Pharaoh called for Moses. “Go and worship the Lord,” he said. “Just leave your flocks and herds here. You can even take your children with you.”"
Exodus,10,25,"But Moses replied, “You must also let us have animals for sacrifices and burnt offerings, so we can offer them to the Lord our God."
Exodus,10,26,"Our livestock have to go with us too—not a single animal will be left behind. We'll need some of them to worship the Lord our God, and we won't know how we are to worship the Lord until we get there.”"
Exodus,10,27,"But the Lord made Pharaoh stubborn, and he would not let them go."
Exodus,10,28,"Pharaoh shouted at Moses, “Get out of here! I don't want to see you ever again! If I ever do see you again you'll die!”"
Exodus,10,29,"“May it be as you say,” Moses replied. “I won't see you again.”"
Exodus,11,1,"The Lord told Moses, “There's one last plague I will bring down on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that he will let you go, but when he does, he'll expel every one of you from the country."
Exodus,11,2,"Now go and tell the Israelites, both men and women, to ask their Egyptian neighbors for silver and gold objects.”"
Exodus,11,3,"The Lord made the Egyptians look favorably on the Israelites. In fact, Moses himself was highly respected in Egypt by both Pharaoh's officials and the ordinary people."
Exodus,11,4,"Moses said, “This is what the Lord says: Around midnight I will go through the whole of Egypt."
Exodus,11,5,"Every firstborn son in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the servant girl working with a handmill, as well as all the firstborn of the cattle."
Exodus,11,6,"There will be loud cries of mourning all over Egypt, such as have never been before, and will never be again."
Exodus,11,7,But among all the Israelites there won't even be the sound of a dog barking at them or their animals. That way you will know that the Lord distinguishes between Egypt and Israel.
Exodus,11,8,"All your officials will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, ‘Leave, and take everyone who follows you with you!’ After that I will leave.” Moses was very angry, and left Pharaoh."
Exodus,11,9,"The Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh is refusing to listen to you so I can do even more miracles in Egypt.”"
Exodus,11,10,"Moses and Aaron did these miracles before Pharaoh, but the Lord gave Pharaoh a stubborn attitude, and he wouldn't let the Israelites leave his country."
Exodus,12,1,The Lord told Moses and Aaron while they were still in Egypt
Exodus,12,2,"“This month will be for you the first month, the first month of your year."
Exodus,12,3,"Tell all the Israelites that on the tenth day of this month, every man must choose a lamb for his family, one for each household."
Exodus,12,4,"However, if the household is too small for a whole lamb, then he and his nearest neighbor may choose a lamb according to the total number of people. Divide up the lamb depending on what everybody can eat."
Exodus,12,5,"Your lamb must be a year-old male without any defects, and you can take it either from the sheep or the goats."
Exodus,12,6,"Keep it until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the Israelites will slaughter the animals after sunset and before it gets dark."
Exodus,12,7,They are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they have the meal.
Exodus,12,8,"They are to roast the meat over a fire and eat it that night, together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs."
Exodus,12,9,"You are not to eat the meat raw or boiled in water. All of it must be roasted over a fire, including the head, legs, and its insides."
Exodus,12,10,"Make sure nothing is left until the morning. If there is anything left over, burn it by morning."
Exodus,12,11,"This is how you are to eat the meal. You should be dressed ready to travel, with your sandals on your feet and your walking stick in your hand. You are to eat quickly—it is the Lord's Passover."
Exodus,12,12,"That very night I will go all through Egypt and kill every firstborn of both people and animals, and I will bring condemnation on all the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord."
Exodus,12,13,"The blood on the houses where you live will mark them out. When I see the blood, I will pass over you. No deathly plague will fall on you to destroy you when I attack Egypt."
Exodus,12,14,This will be a day to remember for you. You are to celebrate it as a festival to the Lord for generations to come. You will observe this for all time to come.
Exodus,12,15,For seven days you must eat only bread made without yeast. On the first day you are to get rid of the yeast from your houses. Anyone who eats anything with yeast from the first day to the seventh day must be excluded from the Israelite community.
Exodus,12,16,"On both the first day and on the seventh day you are to have a holy meeting. You must not work on those days, except to prepare food. That is all you are allowed to do."
Exodus,12,17,You are to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread because on this very day I led your tribes by their respective divisions out of Egypt. You are to observe this day for all time to come.
Exodus,12,18,In the first month you are to eat bread without yeast from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day.
Exodus,12,19,"For seven days there must be no yeast in your houses. If anyone eats something with yeast in it, then they must be excluded from the Israelite community, whether they are a foreigner or a native of the land."
Exodus,12,20,You must not eat anything with yeast in it. Eat only bread without yeast in all your homes.”
Exodus,12,21,"Then Moses called together all the elders of Israel and told them, “Go immediately and choose a lamb for each of your families, and kill the Passover lamb."
Exodus,12,22,"Get a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin, and put some on the top and sides of the doorframe. None of you are to go out through door of the house until morning."
Exodus,12,23,"When the Lord passes through to punish the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe. He will pass over the door, and he will not allow the destroyer to enter your houses and kill you."
Exodus,12,24,You and your descendants are to remember to observe these instructions for all time to come.
Exodus,12,25,"When you enter the land that the Lord promised to give you, you are to observe this ceremony."
Exodus,12,26,"When your children come and ask you, ‘Why is this ceremony important to you?’"
Exodus,12,27,"you are to tell them, ‘This is the Passover sacrifice to the Lord. He was the one who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when he killed the Egyptians but spared our households.’” The people bowed down in worship."
Exodus,12,28,Then the Israelites went and did just as the Lord had told Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,12,29,"At midnight the Lord killed every firstborn male in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on his throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner in the jail, and also all the firstborn of the livestock."
Exodus,12,30,"Pharaoh got up during the night, as well as all his officials and all the Egyptians. There were loud cries of agony throughout Egypt, because there wasn't a single house where someone hadn't died."
Exodus,12,31,"Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron during the night and told them, “Get out of here! Leave my people, the two of you and the Israelites! Go, so you can worship the Lord as you have asked."
Exodus,12,32,"Take your flocks and herds as well, just like you've said, and leave! Oh, and bless me too.”"
Exodus,12,33,"The Egyptians urged the Israelites to leave their country as quickly as possible, saying, “Otherwise we'll all die!”"
Exodus,12,34,"So the Israelites picked up their dough before it had risen, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading bowls wrapped in clothing."
Exodus,12,35,"In addition, the Israelites did what Moses had told them and asked the Egyptians for objects of silver and gold, and for clothing."
Exodus,12,36,The Lord had made the Egyptians look so favorably on the Israelites that they agreed to their request. In this way they took the wealth of the Egyptians.
Exodus,12,37,"The Israelites set out on foot from Rameses for Succoth and numbered about 600,000 men, as well as women and children."
Exodus,12,38,In addition many foreigners joined them. They also took with them large herds and flocks of livestock.
Exodus,12,39,"Since their bread dough didn't have any yeast, the Israelites baked what they had brought out of Egypt into loaves without yeast. This was because when they were driven out of Egypt they had to leave in a hurry and didn't have time to prepare food for themselves."
Exodus,12,40,The Israelites had lived in Egypt for 430 years.
Exodus,12,41,"On the very day the 430 years ended, all the tribes of the Lord by their respective divisions left Egypt."
Exodus,12,42,"Because the Lord kept watch that night to lead them out of the land of Egypt, this same night you are to keep watch as an observance to honor the Lord, and this to be kept by all Israelites for generations to come."
Exodus,12,43,"The Lord told Moses and Aaron, “This is the Passover ceremony. No foreigner is allowed to eat it."
Exodus,12,44,But any slave who has been bought can eat it once you have circumcised him.
Exodus,12,45,Foreign visitors or those hired from other nations shall not eat the Passover.
Exodus,12,46,"It has to be eaten inside the house. You are not allowed to take any of the meat outside the house, or to break any of the bones."
Exodus,12,47,All Israelites are to celebrate it.
Exodus,12,48,"If there's a foreigner who lives with you and wants to celebrate the Lord's Passover, all the males in their household have to be circumcised. Then he may come and celebrate it, and he shall be treated like a native of the land. But no man who is not circumcised may eat it."
Exodus,12,49,The same rule applies to both the native and the foreigner who lives among you.”
Exodus,12,50,Then all the Israelites followed these instructions. They did exactly what the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,12,51,That very day the Lord led the Israelite tribes out of Egypt by their respective tribal divisions.
Exodus,13,1,The Lord told Moses
Exodus,13,2,"“Every firstborn male is to be dedicated to me. The firstborn from every Israelite family belongs to me, and also every firstborn animal.”"
Exodus,13,3,"So Moses told the people, “Remember this is the day you left Egypt, the land of your slavery, for the Lord led you out of it by his amazing power. (Nothing with yeast in it shall be eaten.)"
Exodus,13,4,"Today you are on your way, this day in the month of Abib."
Exodus,13,5,"The Lord is going to take you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites, the land he promised your forefathers he would give you, a land flowing with milk and honey. So you are to observe this ceremony in this month."
Exodus,13,6,"For seven days you are to only eat bread without yeast, and on the seventh day hold a religious festival to honor the Lord."
Exodus,13,7,"Only bread without yeast is to be eaten during those seven days. You are not to have any yeast, in fact there is to be no yeast in any place where you live."
Exodus,13,8,"On that day tell your children, ‘This is because of what the Lord did for me when I left Egypt.’"
Exodus,13,9,When you celebrate this ceremony it will be like a sign on your hand and a reminder between your eyes that this teaching of the Lord should be spoken about regularly. For the Lord led you out of Egypt with his great power.
Exodus,13,10,That's why you are to observe this ceremony at the proper time every year.
Exodus,13,11,"Once the Lord takes you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he promised you and your forefathers"
Exodus,13,12,"you are to present to the Lord all firstborn males, human or animal. The firstborn males of your livestock all belong to the Lord."
Exodus,13,13,"You must buy back every firstborn donkey with a lamb, and if you don't do so, you have to break its neck. You must buy back every firstborn of your sons."
Exodus,13,14,"When in the future your children come to you and ask, ‘Why is this ceremony important to you?’ you are to tell them, ‘The Lord led us out of Egypt, the land of our slavery, by his amazing power."
Exodus,13,15,"Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us leave, so the Lord killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human and animal. That's the reason why I sacrifice to the Lord the firstborn male of every animal, and I buy back all the firstborn of my sons.’"
Exodus,13,16,"In this way it will be like a sign on your hand and a reminder between your eyes, for the Lord led us out of Egypt by his amazing power.”"
Exodus,13,17,"When Pharaoh let the Israelites leave, God did not lead them along the road through the land of the Philistines, even though that was a shorter way. For God said, “If they are forced to fight, they might change their minds and go back to Egypt.”"
Exodus,13,18,So God led the people by the longer way through the desert towards the Red Sea. When the Israelites left the land of Egypt they were like an army ready for battle.
Exodus,13,19,"Moses carried Joseph's bones with him because Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear a solemn promise, saying, “God will definitely take care of you, and then you must take my bones with you when you leave here.”"
Exodus,13,20,They traveled on from Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.
Exodus,13,21,"The Lord went ahead of them as a pillar of cloud to show them the way during the day, and as a pillar of fire to provide them with light at night. Like this they could travel by day or night."
Exodus,13,22,The pillar of cloud during the day and the pillar of fire at night were always in front of the people.
Exodus,14,1,The Lord told Moses
Exodus,14,2,"“Tell the Israelites to turn back and set up camp near Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. You are to camp beside the sea, opposite Baal-zephon."
Exodus,14,3,Pharaoh will conclude about the Israelites: ‘They're wandering about the country in confusion—the desert has blocked them from leaving.’
Exodus,14,4,"I will give Pharaoh a stubborn attitude so that he will chase after them to get them back. But I will gain respect through what happens to Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord.” So the Israelites did as they were instructed."
Exodus,14,5,"When the king of Egypt found out that the Israelites had left in a hurry, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about what had happened and said, “What have we done? We have let all these Israelite slaves go!”"
Exodus,14,6,So Pharaoh had his chariot made ready and set out with his army.
Exodus,14,7,"He took 600 of his best chariots along with all the other chariots of Egypt, each with their officer-in-charge."
Exodus,14,8,"The Lord gave Pharaoh, king of Egypt, a stubborn attitude so he chased after the Israelites, who were leaving with their fists raised in triumph."
Exodus,14,9,"The Egyptians set out in pursuit—all Pharaoh's horses and chariots, horsemen and soldiers. They caught up with the Israelites while they were camped beside the sea near Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon."
Exodus,14,10,The Israelites looked back and saw Pharaoh and the Egyptian army approaching. They were absolutely terrified and cried out to the Lord for help.
Exodus,14,11,"They complained to Moses, “Were there no graves in Egypt that you had to bring us out here in the desert to die? What have you done to us by making us leave Egypt?"
Exodus,14,12,"Didn't we tell you back in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone so that we can go on being slaves to the Egyptians’? It would have been better for us to be Egyptian slaves than to die here in the desert!”"
Exodus,14,13,"But Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand where you are and you will see how the Lord will save you today. The Egyptians you see right now, you will never see again!"
Exodus,14,14,The Lord is going to fight for you—you don't need to do anything.”
Exodus,14,15,"The Lord told Moses, “Why are you crying out to me for help? Tell the Israelites to move forward."
Exodus,14,16,You are to pick up your walking stick and hold it out in your hand over the sea. Divide it so the Israelites can walk through the sea on dry ground.
Exodus,14,17,"I will give the Egyptians a stubborn, hard-hearted attitude so that they will chase in after them. Then I will gain respect through what happens to Pharaoh and all his army, chariots, and horsemen."
Exodus,14,18,"The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I gain respect through Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”"
Exodus,14,19,"The angel of God, who had been leading the Israelites, moved behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front of them and stood behind them"
Exodus,14,20,"so that it was positioned between the Egyptian and Israelite camps. The cloud was in darkness on one side, but it lit up the night on the other. No one from either camp went near the other during the night."
Exodus,14,21,"Then Moses held out his hand over the sea, and all through the night the Lord forced the sea back with a strong east wind, and turned the bottom of the sea into dry land. So the water was divided"
Exodus,14,22,"and the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water to their right and left."
Exodus,14,23,"The Egyptians chased after them—all Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and horsemen. They followed the Israelites into the sea."
Exodus,14,24,"But at the end of the night the Lord looked down on the Egyptian army from the pillar of fire and cloud, and he threw them into a panic."
Exodus,14,25,"He made their chariot wheels get stuck so it was hard for them to drive. The Egyptians shouted out, “Retreat! We must run from the Israelites because the Lord is fighting for them against us!”"
Exodus,14,26,"Then the Lord told Moses, “Hold out your hand over the sea, so that the water will pour back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.”"
Exodus,14,27,"So Moses held out his hand over the sea, and at dawn the sea returned to normal. As the Egyptians retreated, the Lord swept them into the sea."
Exodus,14,28,The water poured back and covered the chariots and horsemen—the whole of Pharaoh's army that had chased after the Israelites into the sea. Not a single one of them survived.
Exodus,14,29,"But the Israelites had walked through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water to their right and left."
Exodus,14,30,The Lord saved the Israelites from the threat of the Egyptians—the Israelites saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore.
Exodus,14,31,"When the Israelites saw the great power that the Lord had used against the Egyptians, they were in awe of the Lord, and they trusted in him and in his servant Moses."
Exodus,15,1,"Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord:
I will sing to the Lord, for he is supreme! He has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea."
Exodus,15,2,"The Lord gives me strength. He is the theme of my song. He saves me. He is my God, and I will praise him. He is my father's God, and I will honor him."
Exodus,15,3,The Lord is like a warrior. His name is the Lord.
Exodus,15,4,He threw Pharaoh's chariots and his army into the sea. Pharaoh's best officers were drowned in the Red Sea.
Exodus,15,5,The flooding water covered them. They dropped down into the depths like a stone.
Exodus,15,6,"Your power, Lord, is truly amazing! Your power, Lord, crushed the enemy."
Exodus,15,7,By your majestic power you destroyed those who opposed you. Your anger blazed out and burned them up like stubble.
Exodus,15,8,You blew and the sea piled up. The waves stood straight like a wall. The depths of the ocean turned solid.
Exodus,15,9,"The enemy bragged, “I will chase them and catch up with them. I will divide the plunder. I will eat them alive. I will swing my sword. By my hand I will destroy them.”"
Exodus,15,10,But you blew with your breath and the sea swept over them. They sank down like lead in the swirling waters.
Exodus,15,11,"Who is like you among the gods, Lord? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, awesome in wonder, doing miracles?"
Exodus,15,12,"You acted, and the earth swallowed the Egyptians."
Exodus,15,13,You led the people you saved with your trustworthy love. You will guide them in your strength to your holy home.
Exodus,15,14,The nations will hear what has happened and will shake with fear. The people who live in Philistia will experience agonizing distress.
Exodus,15,15,The Edomite chiefs will be terrified. The Moabite leaders will tremble. The people living in Canaan will melt away in panic.
Exodus,15,16,"Terror and fright will fall on them. Lord, because of your great power, they will be as still as stone until your people pass by, until the people you bought pass by."
Exodus,15,17,"You will take your people and plant them on the mountain that you own, the place that you, Lord, have prepared as your home, the sanctuary that your hands have built, Lord."
Exodus,15,18,The Lord will reign forever and ever!
Exodus,15,19,"When Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and horsemen went into the sea, the Lord brought the water rushing back over them. But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground."
Exodus,15,20,"Miriam the prophet, Aaron's sister, picked up a tambourine, and all the women followed her dancing and playing tambourines."
Exodus,15,21,"Miriam sang to them: “Sing to the Lord, for he is supreme! He has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea.”"
Exodus,15,22,Then Moses led Israel away from the Red Sea and into the Desert of Shur. For three days they walked in the desert but couldn't find any water.
Exodus,15,23,"When they arrived at Marah, the water there was too bitter to drink. (That's why the place is called Marah.)"
Exodus,15,24,"So the people complained to Moses, asking, “What are we going to drink?”"
Exodus,15,25,"Moses called out to the Lord for help, and the Lord showed him a piece of wood. When he threw it into the water, it became sweet.
There the Lord gave them rules and instructions and also tested their loyalty to him."
Exodus,15,26,"He told them, “If you pay attention to what the Lord your God says, do what is right in his sight, obey his commands, and keep all his regulations, then I will not make you suffer from any of the diseases I gave the Egyptians because I am the Lord who heals you.”"
Exodus,15,27,"Then they traveled on to Elim, which had twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees. They set up camp there beside the water."
Exodus,16,1,"The whole Israelite community left Elim and went to the Desert of Sin, between Elim and Sinai. This was on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had left the land of Egypt."
Exodus,16,2,There in the desert they complained to Moses and Aaron.
Exodus,16,3,“The Lord should've killed us back in Egypt!” the Israelites told them. “At least there we could sit down beside stewpots of meat and eat bread until we were full. But you had to bring all of us out here in the desert to starve us all to death!”
Exodus,16,4,"The Lord told Moses, “Just watch! I'm going to rain down bread from heaven for you! Each day the people are to go out and collect enough for that day. I'm going to test them by this to find out whether they'll follow my instructions or not."
Exodus,16,5,On the sixth day they are to collect twice as much as usual and prepare it.”
Exodus,16,6,"So Moses and Aaron explained to all the Israelites, “This evening you will have the proof that it was the Lord who led you out of Egypt"
Exodus,16,7,and in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord displayed as he responds to the complaints he's heard you making against him. For why should you be complaining to us? We're nobodies!”
Exodus,16,8,"Then Moses continued, “The Lord is going to give you meat to eat this evening and as much bread as you want in the morning, for he has heard your complaints against him. Why are you complaining to us nobodies? Your complaints aren't directed against us, but against the Lord.”"
Exodus,16,9,"Then Moses said to Aaron, “Tell the whole Israelite community, ‘Present yourselves before the Lord, because he has heard your complaints.’”"
Exodus,16,10,"While Aaron was still speaking to all the Israelites, they looked toward the desert and saw the glory of the Lord appear in a cloud."
Exodus,16,11,The Lord told Moses
Exodus,16,12,"“I have heard the complaints of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘In the evening you will eat meat, and in the morning you will have as much bread as you want. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.’”"
Exodus,16,13,"That evening quail flew in and landed, filling the camp. In the morning dew covered the ground all around the camp."
Exodus,16,14,"Once the dew had gone, there was something thin and flaky on the desert, looking like frost crystals on the ground."
Exodus,16,15,"When the Israelites saw it, they asked each another, “What is it?” because they had no idea what it was.
So Moses explained to them, “It's the bread the Lord has provided for you to eat."
Exodus,16,16,This is what the Lord has ordered you to do: ‘All of you shall collect as much as is needed. Take an omer for each person in your tent.’”
Exodus,16,17,"So the Israelites did as they were told. Some collected more, while others collected less."
Exodus,16,18,"But when they measured it out in omers, those who had collected a lot didn't have any left over, while those who had only collected a little still had enough. Each person collected as much as they needed to eat."
Exodus,16,19,"Then Moses said to them, “No one is to leave any of it until the morning.”"
Exodus,16,20,"But some didn't listen to Moses. They did leave some of it until the morning, and it was full of maggots and smelled bad. Moses became angry with them."
Exodus,16,21,"So each morning everyone collected as much as they needed, and when the sun became hot, it melted away to nothing."
Exodus,16,22,"However, on the sixth day, they collected twice as much of this food, two omers for each person. All the Israelite leaders came and told Moses what they had done."
Exodus,16,23,"Moses replied, “These are the Lord's instructions: ‘Tomorrow is a special day of rest, a holy Sabbath to honor the Lord. So bake what you want, and boil what you want. Then put to one side what's left and keep it until morning.’”"
Exodus,16,24,"So they kept it until morning as Moses had ordered, and it didn't smell bad or have any maggots."
Exodus,16,25,"Moses told them, “Eat it today, because today is a Sabbath to honor the Lord. Today you won't find anything out there."
Exodus,16,26,"You can go out collecting for six days, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, it won't be there.”"
Exodus,16,27,"However, on the seventh day some people still went out collecting, but they did not find anything."
Exodus,16,28,"The Lord told Moses, “How long are you going to refuse to obey my commands and instructions?"
Exodus,16,29,"You need to understand that the Lord has given you the Sabbath, so on the sixth day he will provide you with food for two days. On the seventh day, everyone has to stay where they are—no one needs to go out.”"
Exodus,16,30,So the people did no work on the seventh day.
Exodus,16,31,The Israelites called the food manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers with honey.
Exodus,16,32,"Moses said, “This is what the Lord has ordered: ‘Keep an omer of manna as a reminder for future generations, so that they can see the food I used to feed you in the desert when I led you out of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,16,33,"So Moses told Aaron, “Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the Lord to be kept as a reminder for future generations.”"
Exodus,16,34,"Aaron did so and placed the jar in front of the Testimony, to be preserved just as the Lord had ordered Moses."
Exodus,16,35,"The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to the land where they would settle down—they ate manna until they arrived at the border of Canaan."
Exodus,16,36,(An omer is a tenth of an ephah.)
Exodus,17,1,"Then all the Israelites left the Desert of Sin, going from place to place as they followed the Lord's commands. They camped at Rephidim, but there wasn't any water for the people to drink."
Exodus,17,2,"Some of them came and complained to Moses, saying, “Give us water to drink!”
“Why are you complaining to me?” Moses asked. “Why are you trying to challenge the Lord?”"
Exodus,17,3,"But the people were so thirsty for water there that they went on complaining to Moses, saying, “Why did you have to bring us out of Egypt? Are you trying to kill us and our children and livestock by thirst?”"
Exodus,17,4,"Moses cried out to the Lord, “What am I going to do with these people? A bit more of this and they're going to stone me!”"
Exodus,17,5,"The Lord told Moses, “Go ahead of the people, and take some of the elders of Israel with you. Take with you the walking stick you used to hit the Nile, and just go on ahead."
Exodus,17,6,"Look, I will stand there beside you by the rock at Horeb. When you hit the rock water will pour out for the people to drink.” So Moses did this as the elders of Israel watched."
Exodus,17,7,"He called the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites argued there, and because they challenged the Lord, saying, “Is the Lord with us, or not?”"
Exodus,17,8,Then some Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.
Exodus,17,9,"Moses told Joshua, “Choose some men and go out and fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I'll stand on the top of this hill holding the walking stick of God.”"
Exodus,17,10,"Joshua did what Moses told him and fought the Amalekites, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur climbed to the top of the hill."
Exodus,17,11,"As long as Moses held up the walking stick in his hands, the Israelites were the ones winning, but when he lowered them, it was the Amalekites."
Exodus,17,12,"So when Moses' hands became heavy, the others took a stone and put it under him for him to sit on. Aaron and Hur stood on each side of Moses and held his hands up. In this way his hands were kept firmly up until the sun went down."
Exodus,17,13,As a result Joshua defeated the Amalekite army.
Exodus,17,14,"The Lord told Moses, “Write all this down on a scroll as a reminder and read it out loud to Joshua, because I'm going to completely wipe out the Amalekites so nobody on earth will remember them.”"
Exodus,17,15,Moses built an altar and called it “The Lord is my Banner of Victory.”
Exodus,17,16,“Hold up the victory banner of the Lord!” Moses declared. “The Lord will go on fighting the Amalekites for all generations!”
Exodus,18,1,"Moses' father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, heard about everything God had done for Moses and his people the Israelites, and how the Lord had led them out of Egypt."
Exodus,18,2,"When Moses had sent home his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro had welcomed her"
Exodus,18,3,"together with her two sons. One son was named Gershom, for Moses had said, “I have been a foreigner in a foreign land.”"
Exodus,18,4,"The other son was named Eliezer, because Moses had said, “The God of my father was my helper, and saved me from death at Pharaoh's hand.”"
Exodus,18,5,"Moses' father-in-law Jethro, together with Moses' wife and sons, came to see him in the desert at the camp near the mountain of God."
Exodus,18,6,"Moses was told beforehand, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to see you together with your wife and her two sons.”"
Exodus,18,7,Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They asked each other how they were and then went into the tent.
Exodus,18,8,"Moses told his father-in-law about everything the Lord had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians on behalf of the Israelites, about all the troubles they had experienced on the way, and about how the Lord had saved them."
Exodus,18,9,Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the Lord had done for Israel when he'd saved them from the Egyptians.
Exodus,18,10,"Jethro announced, “May the Lord be blessed, who saved you from the Egyptians and from Pharaoh."
Exodus,18,11,"This is so convincing to me that the Lord is greater than all other gods, for he saved the people from the Egyptians when they acted so arrogantly towards the Israelites.”"
Exodus,18,12,"Then Jethro presented a burnt offering and sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with him in God's presence."
Exodus,18,13,"The following day Moses sat as a judge for the people, and they presented their cases to him from morning to evening."
Exodus,18,14,"When his father-in-law saw everything that Moses was doing for the people, he asked, “What's all this you're doing for the people? Why are you sitting alone as judge, with everyone presenting their cases to you from morning to evening?”"
Exodus,18,15,"“Because the people come to me to ask God for his decision,” Moses replied."
Exodus,18,16,"“When they argue over something, the case is brought before me to decide between them, and I explain to them God's laws and regulations.”"
Exodus,18,17,"Jethro told him, “What you're doing is not the best."
Exodus,18,18,"You, and these people who come to you, are all going to wear yourselves out, because the workload is far too heavy. You can't handle it alone."
Exodus,18,19,"So please listen to me. I'm going to give you some advice, and God will be with you. Yes, you must continue to be the people's representative before God, and take their cases to him."
Exodus,18,20,Go on teaching them the laws and regulations. Show them how to live and the work they are to do.
Exodus,18,21,"But now you should choose men who are competent from among the people, men who respect God and who are trustworthy and not corrupt. Put them in charge of the people as leaders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens."
Exodus,18,22,"These men are to judge the people on a continuing basis. Major issues they can bring to you, but they can decide all the small matters themselves. In this way your burden will be made lighter as they share it with you."
Exodus,18,23,"If you follow my advice, and if it's what God tells you to do, then you will be able to survive, and all these people can go home satisfied that their cases have been heard.”"
Exodus,18,24,Moses listened to what his father-in-law said and followed all his advice.
Exodus,18,25,"So Moses chose competent men from all of Israel and put them in charge of the people as leaders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens."
Exodus,18,26,"They acted as judges for the people on a continuing basis. They brought the difficult cases to Moses, but they would judge the small matters themselves."
Exodus,18,27,"Then Moses sent Jethro on his way, and he went back to his own country."
Exodus,19,1,"Two months to the day after they left Egypt, the Israelites arrived at the Sinai desert."
Exodus,19,2,"They had set out from Rephidim, and after they entered the Sinai desert they camped there in front of the mountain."
Exodus,19,3,"Moses went up the mountain to God. The Lord spoke to Moses from the mountain, and told him, “This is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob, the Israelites"
Exodus,19,4,"‘You saw for yourselves what I did to the Egyptians, and how I carried you on eagles' wings, how I brought you to myself."
Exodus,19,5,"Now if you really obey what I say and keep the agreement with me, then out of all the nations you will be a special people that belong to me. While the whole world is mine"
Exodus,19,6,"for me you will be a kingdom of priests, a holy nation.’ This is what you are to tell the Israelites.”"
Exodus,19,7,"So Moses went back down and summoned the elders of the people, and presented to them everything the Lord had ordered him to say."
Exodus,19,8,"Everyone answered, “We promise to do everything the Lord says.” Then Moses took the people's answer back to the Lord."
Exodus,19,9,"The Lord told Moses, “Look! I'm going to come to you in a thick cloud so the people will hear me speaking with you and as a result they will always trust you.” Then Moses reported to the Lord what the people had said."
Exodus,19,10,"The Lord told Moses, “Go back down and prepare them spiritually today and tomorrow. They must wash their clothes"
Exodus,19,11,and be ready on the third day because that is when the Lord will descend upon Mount Sinai in the full view of everyone.
Exodus,19,12,"Set up a boundary for the people all around and warn them, ‘Watch out! Don't try to go up the mountain—don't even touch it! For anyone who touches the mountain will most certainly be killed. Don't touch any person or any animal that has touched the mountain."
Exodus,19,13,Make sure they are stoned or shot with arrows—they must not be allowed to live.’ Only when there is a long blast on the ram's horn can the people come up the mountain.”
Exodus,19,14,Moses went down the mountain and prepared the people spiritually and they washed their clothes.
Exodus,19,15,"He instructed the people, “Get ready for the third day, and don't be intimate with a woman.”"
Exodus,19,16,"When morning came on the third day there was thunder and lightning, and a thick cloud covered the mountain. There was the very loud sound of a ram's horn, and everyone in the camp shook with fear."
Exodus,19,17,Moses led the people out from the camp to meet God. They stood at the foot of the mountain.
Exodus,19,18,"Smoke poured out over the whole of Mount Sinai because the Lord's presence had come down like fire. The smoke rose up like smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain shook furiously."
Exodus,19,19,"As the sound of the ram's horn grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in a loud, thunderous voice."
Exodus,19,20,"The Lord descended on the top of Mount Sinai, and he called Moses to come up there. So Moses went up"
Exodus,19,21,"and the Lord told him, “Go back down, and warn the people not to force their way across the boundary to try to come to the Lord or they will die."
Exodus,19,22,"Even the priests, who come before the Lord, must prepare themselves spiritually, so that the Lord does not punish them.”"
Exodus,19,23,"But Moses said to the Lord, “The people cannot come up Mount Sinai. You yourself warned us, ‘Set up a boundary around the mountain, and treat it as holy.’”"
Exodus,19,24,"The Lord told him, “Go down and bring Aaron back up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way to come up to the Lord, or he will punish them.”"
Exodus,19,25,So Moses went down and explained to the people what the Lord had said.
Exodus,20,1,God spoke all the following words
Exodus,20,2,"“I am the Lord your God, who led you out of Egypt, out of the land of your slavery."
Exodus,20,3,You must not have any other gods except me.
Exodus,20,4,"You must not make for yourself any kind of idol, whether in the form of anything in the heavens above, or on the earth beneath, or in the waters below."
Exodus,20,5,"You must not bow down before them or worship them; for I am the Lord your God and I am passionately exclusive. I lay the consequences of the sin of those who hate me on their sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons"
Exodus,20,6,but I show trustworthy love to the thousands of generations who love me and keep my commandments.
Exodus,20,7,"You must not use the name of the Lord your God in a wrong way, for the Lord will not forgive anyone who uses his name in a wrong way."
Exodus,20,8,Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.
Exodus,20,9,You have six days to work and earn your living
Exodus,20,10,"but the seventh day is the Sabbath to honor the Lord your God. On this day you must not do any work—not you, not your son or daughter, not your male slave or female slave or livestock, and not the foreigner who is staying with you."
Exodus,20,11,"For the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and everything in them in six days, and then rested on the seventh day. That's why the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."
Exodus,20,12,"Honor your father and mother, so that you may live a long time in the land that the Lord your God is giving you."
Exodus,20,13,You must not murder.
Exodus,20,14,You must not commit adultery.
Exodus,20,15,You must not steal.
Exodus,20,16,You must not give false evidence against others.
Exodus,20,17,"You must not desire to have anyone else's house. You must not desire to have their wife, or their male slave or female slave, or their ox or donkey, or anything else that belongs to them.”"
Exodus,20,18,"When all the people heard the thunder and the sound of the trumpet, and saw the lightning and the smoke from the mountain, they trembled with fear and stood a long way off."
Exodus,20,19,"“You speak to us, and we'll listen,” they said to Moses. “But don't let God speak to us, or we'll die.”"
Exodus,20,20,"Moses told them, “Do not be afraid, for God has only come to test you. He wants you to be in awe of him so that you don't sin.”"
Exodus,20,21,"The people stood a long way off as Moses went over to the thick, dark cloud where God was."
Exodus,20,22,"The Lord told Moses, “This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘You saw for yourselves that I spoke with you from heaven."
Exodus,20,23,You must not make any idols of silver or gold to worship in addition to me.
Exodus,20,24,"Make me an altar of earth, and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and peace offerings, your sheep, goats, and cattle. Wherever I decide to be worshiped, I will come to you and bless you."
Exodus,20,25,"Now if you make an altar out of stones for me, you must not build it with cut stones, because if you use a chisel to cut the stone, you make it unholy."
Exodus,20,26,"Also, you must not go up to my altar using steps, so your private parts are not seen.’”"
Exodus,21,1,“These are the regulations you are to present to them
Exodus,21,2,"If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to work for you for six years. But in the seventh year, he is to be freed without having to pay anything."
Exodus,21,3,"If he was single when he came, he is to leave single. If he had a wife when he came, she is to leave with him."
Exodus,21,4,"If his master provides him a wife and she has children with him, the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and only the man shall be freed."
Exodus,21,5,"However, if the slave formally states, ‘I love my master and my wife and children; I do not want to be freed,’"
Exodus,21,6,then his master is to take him before the judges. Then he shall have him stand against the door or doorpost and use a metal tool to make a hole in his ear. Then he shall work for his master for life.
Exodus,21,7,"If a man sells his daughter as a slave, she is not to be freed in the same way as male slaves."
Exodus,21,8,"If the man who chose her for himself is not pleased with her, he must let her be bought back. He is not permitted to sell her to foreigners, since he has been unfair to her."
Exodus,21,9,"If he chooses to give her to his son, he must treat her as a daughter."

Exodus,21,18,"If men are fighting and one hits the other with a stone or with his fist, and the injured man doesn't die but has to stay in bed"

Exodus,21,20,"Anyone who hits their male or female slave with a rod, and the slave dies as a result, must be punished."

Exodus,21,29,"But if the ox has repeatedly hurt people with its horns, and its owner has been warned but still doesn't keep it under control, and it kills a man or woman, then the ox must be stoned to death and its owner must also be executed."
Exodus,21,30,"But if instead the payment of compensation is required, the owner may buy back his or her life by paying the full amount of compensation demanded."
Exodus,21,31,If the ox uses its horns and kills a son or a daughter the same rule is applicable.

Exodus,22,2,"If a thief is discovered breaking into someone's house and is beaten to death, no one shall be guilty of murder."

Exodus,22,9,"If there's an argument over the ownership of an ox, a donkey, a sheep, a garment, or anything that was lost that someone says, ‘This is mine,’ both parties are to bring their case before the judges. The one whom the judges find in the wrong must pay the other back double."
Exodus,22,10,"If someone asks a neighbor to look after a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any other animal, but it dies or is injured or is stolen without anybody noticing"
Exodus,22,11,then an oath must be taken before the Lord to decide if the neighbor has taken the owner's property. The owner must accept the oath and not demand compensation.

Exodus,29,24,Give all of them to Aaron and his sons to wave before the Lord as a wave offering.
Exodus,29,25,Then take the different breads back and burn them on the altar on top of the burnt offering to the Lord to be accepted by him.
Exodus,29,26,Take the breast of the ram of Aaron's ordination and wave it before the Lord as a wave offering. This is the part you can keep.
Exodus,29,27,"Set apart for Aaron and his sons the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the offering that is lifted up, both taken from the ram of ordination."
Exodus,29,28,"From now on whenever the Israelites lift up peace offerings to the Lord, these parts will belong to Aaron and his sons forever as a regular share from the Israelites."
Exodus,29,29,"The holy garments that Aaron has will be passed down to his descendants, so they can wear them when they're anointed and ordained."
Exodus,29,30,The descendant who succeeds him as priest and enters the Tent of Meeting to serve in the Holy Place must wear them for the seven days of his ordination.
Exodus,29,31,Take the ram of ordination and boil its meat in a holy place.
Exodus,29,32,"Aaron and his sons are to eat the ram's meat, and the bread that is in the basket, at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting."
Exodus,29,33,"They are to eat the meat and the bread that were part of the offerings that symbolized the forgiveness required for their ordination and dedication. No one else may eat them, because they are holy."
Exodus,29,34,"If any of the meat of ordination or any bread remains until the morning, burn what's left. It must not be eaten, because it's holy."
Exodus,29,35,"This is the process you are to follow for Aaron and his sons, observing all the instructions I have given you. It will take seven days to ordain them."
Exodus,29,36,Every day you are to sacrifice a bull as a sin offering for forgiveness. When you do this the altar needs to be purified. Anoint it to make it holy.
Exodus,29,37,"For seven days you shall purify the altar and consecrate it. Then the altar will become completely holy, and everything that touches the altar will become holy."
Exodus,29,38,"You are to offer two lambs that are a year old on the altar, daily and continually."
Exodus,29,39,"In the morning offer one lamb, and offer the other one in the evening before it gets dark."
Exodus,29,40,"With the first lamb also offer a tenth of an ephah of best quality flour, mixed with a quarter of a hin of olive oil, and a drink offering of a quarter of a hin of wine."
Exodus,29,41,"Then offer the second lamb in the evening, with the same grain and drink offerings as in the morning, a burnt offering to the Lord and accepted by him."
Exodus,29,42,These burnt offerings will be made continually for all generations at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting in the Lord's presence. I will meet you there to speak with you.
Exodus,29,43,"I will meet with the Israelites there, and that place will be made holy by my glory."
Exodus,29,44,"In this way I will dedicate the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and I will dedicate Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests."
Exodus,29,45,Then I will live with the Israelites and be their God.
Exodus,29,46,"They will know that I am the Lord their God, who led them out of Egypt, so that I could live with them. I am the Lord their God."
Exodus,30,1,“Make from acacia wood an altar for burning incense.
Exodus,30,2,"It shall be square, measuring a cubit by a cubit, by two cubits high, with horns on its corners that are all one piece with the altar."
Exodus,30,3,"Cover its top, its side, and its horns with pure gold, and make a gold trim to go all around it."
Exodus,30,4,On two of the altar's sides make two gold rings and attach them below the trim to hold the poles that carry it.
Exodus,30,5,Make the poles of acacia wood and cover them with gold.
Exodus,30,6,Put the altar in front of the veil that hangs before the Ark of the Testimony and the atonement cover that is over the Testimony where I will meet with you.
Exodus,30,7,Aaron is to burn fragrant incense on the altar every morning when he takes care of the lamps.
Exodus,30,8,When he lights the lamps in the evening he must burn incense again so that incense will always be burned in the Lord's presence for generations to come.
Exodus,30,9,"Don't offer on this altar any unapproved incense or any burnt offering or grain offering, and do not pour out a drink offering upon it."
Exodus,30,10,Once a year Aaron must perform the atonement ritual by placing blood on the horns of the altar from the sin offering for atonement. This yearly atonement ritual must be carried out for generations to come. This is the Lord's holy altar.”
Exodus,30,11,The Lord told Moses
Exodus,30,12,"“When you take a census of the Israelites, each man must pay the Lord to buy back his life when he's counted. Then they won't suffer from the plague when they're counted."
Exodus,30,13,"Each one who crosses over to those counted must give a half shekel (using the sanctuary shekel standard, which weighs twenty gerahs). This half shekel is an offering to the Lord."
Exodus,30,14,This offering to the Lord is required from everyone twenty years old and more.
Exodus,30,15,When you give this offering to buy back your lives the rich are not to give more than a half shekel and the poor are not to give less.
Exodus,30,16,Take this money paid by the Israelites and use it for the expenses involved in the services of the Tent of Meeting. It will serve as a reminder for the Israelites to buy back your lives in the presence of the Lord.”
Exodus,30,17,The Lord told Moses
Exodus,30,18,"“Make a bronze basin with a bronze stand for washing. Place it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it."
Exodus,30,19,Aaron and his sons will use it to wash their hands and feet.
Exodus,30,20,"Whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting, they are to wash with water so that they will not die. When they approach the altar to present burnt offerings to the Lord"
Exodus,30,21,they must also wash so that they will not die. This requirement is to be observed by them and their descendants for all generations.”
Exodus,30,22,The Lord told Moses
Exodus,30,23,"“Take the best quality spices: 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, 250 shekels of sweet-smelling cinnamon, 250 shekels of aromatic reed"
Exodus,30,24,"500 shekels of cassia (weights using the sanctuary shekel standard), and a hin of olive oil."
Exodus,30,25,"Mix these together into holy anointing oil, an aromatic blend like the product of an expert perfumer. Use it as holy anointing oil."
Exodus,30,26,"Use it to anoint the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of the Testimony"
Exodus,30,27,"the table and all its equipment, the lampstand and its equipment, the altar of incense"
Exodus,30,28,"the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin plus its stand."
Exodus,30,29,Dedicate them so that they will be especially holy. Whatever touches them will become holy.
Exodus,30,30,Anoint Aaron and his sons too and dedicate them to serve as priests for me.
Exodus,30,31,"Tell the Israelites, ‘This is to be my holy anointing oil for all generations to come."
Exodus,30,32,"Don't use it on ordinary people and don't make anything like it using the same formula. It is holy, and you must treat it as being holy."
Exodus,30,33,"Anyone who mixes anointing oil like it, or puts it on someone other than a priest, will be expelled from their people.’”"
Exodus,30,34,"The Lord told Moses, “Take equal amounts of these aromatic spices: balsam resin, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense."
Exodus,30,35,Add some salt and make pure and holy incense blended like the product of an expert perfumer.
Exodus,30,36,"Grind some of it into powder and place it in front of the Ark of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be especially holy to you."
Exodus,30,37,Don't make for yourselves any incense like it using the same formula. You are to consider this incense as holy to the Lord.
Exodus,30,38,Anyone who makes incense like this for themselves to enjoy will be expelled from their people.”
Exodus,31,1,The Lord told Moses
Exodus,31,2,"“I have chosen by name Bezalel, son of Uri, son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah."
Exodus,31,3,"I have filled him with the Spirit of God giving him ability, creativity, and expertise in all kinds of craftsmanship."
Exodus,31,4,"He can produce designs in gold, silver, and bronze"
Exodus,31,5,"he can cut gemstones to place in settings, and he can carve wood. He is a master of every craft."
Exodus,31,6,"I have also chosen Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, to help him. I have also given all the craftsmen the skills needed to make everything that I have ordered you to make"
Exodus,31,7,"the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of the Testimony and its atonement cover, and all the other furniture in the Tent"
Exodus,31,8,"the table with its equipment, the pure gold lampstand with all its equipment, the altar of incense"
Exodus,31,9,"the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin plus its stand"
Exodus,31,10,as well as the woven clothes for both Aaron the priest and for his sons to serve as priests
Exodus,31,11,as well as anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them following all the instructions I have given you.”
Exodus,31,12,The Lord told Moses
Exodus,31,13,"“Tell the Israelites, ‘It's absolutely essential that you keep my Sabbaths. The Sabbath will be a sign between me and you for generations to come, so that you'll know that I am the Lord who makes you holy."
Exodus,31,14,You shall keep the Sabbath because it is holy to you. Anyone who dishonors it must be killed. Anyone who works on that day must be cut off from their people.
Exodus,31,15,"Six days you can work, but the seventh day is to be a Sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord. Anyone who does any work on the Sabbath day must be killed."
Exodus,31,16,"The Israelites must keep the Sabbath, observing the Sabbath as an everlasting agreement for generations to come."
Exodus,31,17,"It's a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for the Lord made the heavens and the earth in six days, but on the seventh day he stopped and he rested.’”"
Exodus,31,18,"When the Lord finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the Testimony, stone tablets written on by the finger of God."
Exodus,32,1,"When the people realized how long Moses was taking before he came back down the mountain, they went together to see Aaron. They told him, “Get up! Make some gods for us who can lead us because this man Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt—we don't know what's happened to him!”"
Exodus,32,2,"“Bring to me the gold earrings that your wives, sons, and daughters are wearing,” Aaron replied."
Exodus,32,3,So everyone took off the gold earrings they were wearing and brought them to Aaron.
Exodus,32,4,"He took what they gave him and using a molding tool cast an idol in the shape of a bull calf. They shouted out, “Israel, these are the gods that brought you out of the land of Egypt.”"
Exodus,32,5,"When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the golden calf and shouted out, “Tomorrow will be a festival to honor the Lord!”"
Exodus,32,6,"Early the next day they sacrificed burnt offerings and presented peace offerings. Then they sat down to celebrate with eating and drinking. Then they got up to dance, and it became like an orgy."
Exodus,32,7,"Then the Lord told Moses, “Get back down, because your people that you brought out of Egypt are acting immorally."
Exodus,32,8,"They have been so quick to abandon the way I ordered them to follow. They have made a metal bull calf idol for themselves, bowing before it in worship and offering sacrifices to it. They're saying, ‘These are the gods that brought you out of the land of Egypt.’”"
Exodus,32,9,"“I know what these people are like,” the Lord continued saying to Moses. “They are so rebellious!"
Exodus,32,10,Now leave me! I am angry with them—let me finish them off! I will make you into a great nation.”
Exodus,32,11,"But Moses pleaded with the Lord his God, saying, “Why are you angry with the people you brought out of the land of Egypt with tremendous power and great strength?"
Exodus,32,12,"Why should the Egyptians be able to say, ‘He brought them out with the evil purpose of killing them in the mountains, wiping them off the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce anger. Please change your mind over the threat against your people."
Exodus,32,13,"Remember you swore a promise your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, telling them, ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars of heaven, and give you all the land I promised to them, and they shall own it forever.’”"
Exodus,32,14,The Lord changed his mind over the disaster he threatened to cause his people.
Exodus,32,15,"Moses turned and went down the mountain, carrying the two stone tablets of the Law written on both sides."
Exodus,32,16,"God had made the tablets, and God had engraved the writing himself."
Exodus,32,17,"When Joshua heard all the shouting from the camp, he said to Moses, “It sounds like fighting in the camp!”"
Exodus,32,18,"But Moses replied, “These are not the shouts of victory or of defeat. What I'm hearing is people partying!”"
Exodus,32,19,As he approached the camp he saw the bull calf idol and the dancing. He got so angry that he threw down the stone tablets and smashed them there at the foot of the mountain.
Exodus,32,20,"He took the bull calf and burned it, and ground it into powder. Then he mixed this with water and made the Israelites drink it."
Exodus,32,21,"Then Moses asked Aaron, “What did these people do to you that you made them sin so badly?”"
Exodus,32,22,"“Please don't get angry with me, my lord,” Aaron replied, “You yourself know how liable these people are to do evil."
Exodus,32,23,"They told me, ‘Make some gods for us who can lead us because this man Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt—we don't know what's happened to him!’"
Exodus,32,24,"So I said to them, ‘Anybody who has gold jewelry, take it off and give it to me.’ I threw the gold into the furnace and out came this bull calf.”"
Exodus,32,25,"Moses saw the people going completely wild because Aaron had let them, and that this had brought ridicule on them from their enemies."
Exodus,32,26,"So he went and stood at the entrance to the camp, and shouted out, “Whoever is on the Lord's side, come and join me!” All the Levites gathered around him."
Exodus,32,27,"Moses told them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: Each of you strap on a sword. Then go all through the camp from one end to the other and kill your brothers, friends, and neighbors.”"
Exodus,32,28,"The Levites did what Moses had told them, and that day around 3,000 men were killed."
Exodus,32,29,"Moses told the Levites, “Today you have dedicated yourselves to the Lord because you took action against your sons and brothers. Today you have gained a blessing for yourselves.”"
Exodus,32,30,"The following day Moses spoke to the people, saying, “You have sinned very badly. But now I will go up to the Lord. Maybe I can get him to forgive your sin.”"
Exodus,32,31,"So Moses went back to the Lord. He said, “Please—the people have sinned very badly by making gods of gold for themselves."
Exodus,32,32,"But now, if you will, forgive their sin. Otherwise just blot me out of the scroll in which you keep your records.”"
Exodus,32,33,"But the Lord replied to Moses, “It's those who sinned against me who will be blotted out of my scroll."
Exodus,32,34,"Now go and lead the people to the place I told you about. Look, my angel will go before you, but at the time I decide to punish, I will punish them for their sin.”"
Exodus,32,35,The Lord brought a plague on the people because they made Aaron make the bull calf.
Exodus,33,1,"Then the Lord told Moses, “Leave this place, you and the people you led out of Egypt, and go to the land I promised with an oath to give to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, telling them, ‘I will give this land to your descendants.’"
Exodus,33,2,"I will send an angel out in front of you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites."
Exodus,33,3,"Enter a land flowing with milk and honey, but I will not accompany you because you are a rebellious people. Otherwise I would destroy you on the way.”"
Exodus,33,4,"When the people heard these words of criticism, they mourned and didn't put on their jewelry."
Exodus,33,5,"For the Lord had previously told Moses, “Tell the people of Israel, ‘You are a rebellious people. If I was with you for just a moment, I would wipe you out. Now remove your jewelry, and I'll decide what to do with you.’”"
Exodus,33,6,So the Israelites took off their jewelry from the time they left Mount Sinai.
Exodus,33,7,Moses used to set up the Tent of Meeting some way outside the camp. Anyone who wanted to ask the Lord anything could go out there to the Tent of Meeting.
Exodus,33,8,"Whenever Moses went out to the Tent, all the people would go and stand at the entrance of their tents. They would watch him until he had gone inside."
Exodus,33,9,"As soon as Moses went into the Tent, the cloud column would descend and stand in the doorway as the Lord spoke with Moses."
Exodus,33,10,"When the people saw the cloud column standing in the doorway to the Tent, everyone would stand up and bow in worship at the entrance of their tents."
Exodus,33,11,"Moses would speak to the Lord face to face as you would talk to a friend, and then return to the camp. However, his young assistant Joshua, son of Nun, stayed in the Tent."
Exodus,33,12,"Moses said to the Lord, “Look, you've been telling me, ‘Go and lead these people,’ but you haven't let me know who you're going to send with me. And yet you have stated, ‘I know you personally, and I'm happy with you.’"
Exodus,33,13,"Now if it's true that you're happy with me, please teach me your ways so I can get to know you, and go on pleasing you. Remember that the people of this nation are yours.”"
Exodus,33,14,"The Lord replied, “I myself will go with you, and I will support you.”"
Exodus,33,15,"“If you don't go with us yourself, then please don't take us away from here,” Moses responded."
Exodus,33,16,"“How will others know that you are happy with me, and with your people, if you don't accompany us? How would anyone tell us apart—me and your people—from every other people who live on the earth?”"
Exodus,33,17,"The Lord told Moses, “I promise to do what you've asked, because I'm happy with you and I know you personally.”"
Exodus,33,18,"“Now please reveal to me your glory,” Moses asked."
Exodus,33,19,"“I will make all the goodness of my character pass in front of you, I will call out the name ‘Yahweh,’ I will show grace to those I want to show grace, and I will show mercy to those I want to show mercy."
Exodus,33,20,"But you won't be able to see my face, because no one can see my face and live.”"
Exodus,33,21,"“Come here and stand by me on this rock,” the Lord went on"
Exodus,33,22,"“and as my glory goes by I'll put you in a crevice of the rock, and I'll cover you with my hand until I have passed by."
Exodus,33,23,Then I'll take my hand away and you'll see my back; but you won't see my face.”
Exodus,34,1,"The Lord told Moses, “Cut out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them again the same words that were on the first tablets—the ones you broke."
Exodus,34,2,"Get ready in the morning, and then come up Mount Sinai. Stand before me there on the mountain top."
Exodus,34,3,"Nobody else can come up with you—I don't want to see anyone anywhere on the mountain, and no flocks or herds should graze at the foot of the mountain.”"
Exodus,34,4,"So Moses cut out two stone tablets like the previous ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning as the Lord had ordered him, taking with him the two stone tablets."
Exodus,34,5,"The Lord descended in a cloud, stood there with him, and called out the name “Yahweh.”"
Exodus,34,6,"The Lord passed in front of him, calling out, “Yahweh! Yahweh! I am the God of grace and mercy! I am slow to become angry, full of trustworthy love and always faithful."
Exodus,34,7,"I go on showing my trustworthy love to thousands, forgiving guilt, rebellion, and sin. But I will definitely not clear the wicked—the impact of sin will affect not only the parents, but also their children and grandchildren, up until the third and fourth generation.”"
Exodus,34,8,"Moses quickly bowed down to the ground, and worshiped."
Exodus,34,9,"He said, “Lord, if it's true that you're happy with me, please accompany us. Admittedly this is a rebellious people, but please forgive our guilt and sin. Accept us as specially belonging to you.”"
Exodus,34,10,"The Lord said, “Look, I'm making an agreement with you. Right in front of all of you I will do miracles that have never been done before—not among anyone anywhere on earth. Everyone here and those around will see the Lord at work, for what I'm going to do for you will be incredible."
Exodus,34,11,"But you must carefully follow what I tell you to do today. Pay attention! I'm going to drive out ahead of you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites."
Exodus,34,12,Make sure you don't agree to a peace treaty with the people living in the land where you are going. Otherwise they will become a trap for you.
Exodus,34,13,"For you must tear down their altars, knock down their idolatrous pillars, and cut down their Asherah poles"
Exodus,34,14,"because you must not worship any other gods than the Lord. His name stands for being exclusive, because he is a God who demands an exclusive relationship."
Exodus,34,15,"Make sure you don't agree to a peace treaty with the people living in the land, for when they prostitute themselves by worshiping and sacrificing to their gods, they will invite you to join them, and you will eat from their pagan sacrifices."
Exodus,34,16,"When you have their daughters marry your sons and those daughters prostitute themselves to their gods, they will make your sons worship their gods in the same way."
Exodus,34,17,Don't make any idols for yourselves.
Exodus,34,18,"Observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast, as I ordered you to do. You are to do this at the specified time in the month of Abib, because that was the month when you left Egypt."
Exodus,34,19,"Every firstborn is mine. That includes all the firstborn males of your livestock from your cattle herds, and flocks."
Exodus,34,20,"You can redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb, but if you don't, you must break its neck. All your firstborn sons must be redeemed. No one is to come before me without an offering."
Exodus,34,21,"You shall work for six days, but you shall rest on the seventh day. Even during the times of sowing and harvest you shall rest."
Exodus,34,22,"Observe the Festival of Weeks when you offer the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the Harvest Festival at the end of the agricultural year."
Exodus,34,23,"Three times every year all your males must appear before the Lord Yahweh, the God of Israel."
Exodus,34,24,"I will drive out the nations ahead of you and expand your borders, and no one will come and take your land when you go three times a year to appear before the Lord your God."
Exodus,34,25,"Don't offer bread made with yeast when you present a sacrifice to me, don't keep any sacrifice from the Passover Feast until the morning."
Exodus,34,26,"When you harvest your crops, bring the firstfruits to the house of the Lord your God.
Don't cook a young goat in milk from its mother.”"
Exodus,34,27,"Then the Lord told Moses, “Write down these words, because these are the basis for the agreement I have made with you and with Israel.”"
Exodus,34,28,"Moses spent forty days and forty nights there with the Lord without eating bread or drinking water. He wrote down on the tablets the words of the agreement, the Ten Commandments."
Exodus,34,29,"When Moses came down from Mount Sinai carrying the two tablets of the Law, he didn't realize that his face was shining brightly because he had been speaking with the Lord."
Exodus,34,30,When Aaron and the Israelites saw Moses with his face shining so brightly they were frightened to approach him.
Exodus,34,31,"But Moses called out to them, so Aaron and all the community leaders went over to him, and he talked with them."
Exodus,34,32,Afterwards all the Israelites came over and he gave them all the Lord's instructions he'd received on Mount Sinai.
Exodus,34,33,"After Moses finished talking with them, he put a veil over his face."
Exodus,34,34,"However, whenever Moses went in to talk with the Lord, he would take off the veil until he came out again. Then he would tell the Israelites the Lord's instructions"
Exodus,34,35,and the Israelites would see his face shining brightly. So he would put the veil over his face until the next time he went to talk with the Lord.
Exodus,35,1,"Moses summoned all the Israelites and told them, “This is what the Lord has ordered you to do"
Exodus,35,2,"Six days you can work, but the seventh day is to be a holy Sabbath of rest to the Lord. Anyone who does any work on the Sabbath day must be killed."
Exodus,35,3,Don't even light a fire in any of your homes on the Sabbath day.”
Exodus,35,4,"Moses also told all the Israelites, “This is what the Lord has commanded"
Exodus,35,5,"Collect an offering to the Lord from what you have. Everyone who wants to should bring an offering to the Lord: gold, silver, and bronze"
Exodus,35,6,"blue, purple, and crimson thread; finely-woven linen and goat hair"
Exodus,35,7,tanned ram skins and fine leather; acacia wood
Exodus,35,8,olive oil for the lamps; spices for the anointing oil and for the aromatic incense
Exodus,35,9,and onyx stones and gemstones for making the ephod and breastpiece.
Exodus,35,10,All your skilled craftsmen are to come and make everything the Lord has commanded
Exodus,35,11,"the Tabernacle with its tent and covering, its clips and frames, its crossbars, posts, and stands"
Exodus,35,12,"the Ark with its poles and atonement cover, and the veil to hang over it"
Exodus,35,13,"the table with its poles, all its equipment, and the Bread of the Presence"
Exodus,35,14,the lampstand of light with its equipment and lamps and olive oil to provide lighting
Exodus,35,15,the altar of incense with its poles; the anointing oil and aromatic incense; the screen for the Tabernacle entrance and all its accessories
Exodus,35,16,"the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grate, its poles and all its utensils; the basin plus its stand"
Exodus,35,17,"the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the courtyard entrance"
Exodus,35,18,"the tent pegs for the Tabernacle and for the courtyard, as well as their ropes"
Exodus,35,19,and the woven clothes for serving in the holy place: the sacred clothing for Aaron the priest and for his sons to serve as priests.”
Exodus,35,20,The Israelites left Moses
Exodus,35,21,"and all those who felt moved to do so and who had a willing spirit came and brought an offering to the Lord for the work making the Tent of Meeting, for everything required for its services, and for the sacred clothing."
Exodus,35,22,"So everyone who was willing, both men and women, came and presented their gold as a thanks offering to the Lord, including brooches, earrings, rings, and necklaces—all kinds of gold jewelry."
Exodus,35,23,"Everyone who had blue, purple, and crimson thread, finely-woven linen, goat hair, tanned ram skins, and fine leather, contributed them."
Exodus,35,24,Those who could present an offering of silver or bronze brought it as a gift to the Lord. Everyone who had acacia wood for any part of the work donated it.
Exodus,35,25,"Every woman skilled in spinning with her hands brought what she had spun: blue, purple, or crimson thread, or finely-woven linen."
Exodus,35,26,All the women who were willing to use their skills spun the goat hair.
Exodus,35,27,The leaders brought onyx stones and gemstones to make the ephod and breastpiece
Exodus,35,28,"as well as spices and olive oil for lighting, for the anointing oil, and for the aromatic incense."
Exodus,35,29,All the Israelite men and women who were willing brought a freewill offering to the Lord for all the work in making what the Lord through Moses had ordered them to do.
Exodus,35,30,"Then Moses told the Israelites, “The Lord has chosen by name Bezalel, son of Uri, son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah."
Exodus,35,31,"He has filled him with the Spirit of God giving him ability, creativity, and expertise in all kinds of craftsmanship."
Exodus,35,32,"He can produce designs in gold, silver, and bronze"
Exodus,35,33,"he can cut gemstones to place in settings, and he can carve wood. He is a master of every craft."
Exodus,35,34,"The Lord has also given him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others."
Exodus,35,35,"He has equipped them with skill to do all kinds of work as engravers, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple, and crimson thread, and finely-woven linen, and as weavers—in fact as skilled designers in all kinds of different crafts.”"
Exodus,36,1,"“So Bezalel, Oholiab, and all the other craftsmen with the necessary expertise, given skill and ability by the Lord, are to work out how to accomplish all the work of constructing the sanctuary as commanded by the Lord.”"
Exodus,36,2,"Moses summoned Bezalel, Oholiab, and all the skilled people who had been given special abilities by the Lord, everyone willing to come and do the work."
Exodus,36,3,Moses gave them everything the Israelites had contributed to carry out the work of constructing the sanctuary. In the meantime the people went on bringing freewill offerings every morning
Exodus,36,4,so much so that all the craftsmen who were working on the sanctuary stopped what they were doing
Exodus,36,5,"and went and told Moses, “The people have already brought enough to complete the work the Lord has ordered us to do.”"
Exodus,36,6,"Moses gave the order, and an announcement was made throughout the camp: “Men and women, don't bring anything more as an offering for the sanctuary.” So the people were stopped from bringing anything more"
Exodus,36,7,since there was already more than enough to do all the work necessary.
Exodus,36,8,"The skilled craftsmen among the workers made the ten curtains for the Tabernacle. They were made of finely-spun linen together with blue, purple, and crimson thread, embroidered with cherubim."
Exodus,36,9,"Each curtain was twenty-eight cubits long by four cubits wide, and they were all the same size."
