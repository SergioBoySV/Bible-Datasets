Psalms,78,37,"Deep down they were not sincere, and did not keep the agreement they had with him."
Psalms,78,38,But being compassionate he pardoned their guilt and did not destroy all of them. He often held back his anger—he did not pour out all his fury.

Psalms,78,52,"But he led out his people like sheep, and guided them like a flock in the wilderness."
Psalms,78,53,"He led them to safety, and they were not afraid. He drowned their enemies in the sea."
Psalms,78,54,"He brought them to the border of his holy land, to this mountainous land that he had conquered for them."
Psalms,78,55,He drove out the heathen nations before them. He divided up the land for them to own. He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
Psalms,78,56,"But they provoked God Most High, rebelling against him. They did not follow what he had told them."
Psalms,78,57,"Just like their forefathers they turned away from God and were unfaithful to him, as twisted as a defective bow."

Psalms,78,70,"He chose his servant David, taking him from the sheep pens"
Psalms,78,71,"taking him from caring for the sheep and lambs to be a shepherd to the descendants of Jacob—God's special people, Israel."
