1 Chronicles,19,2,"David said, “I will be kind to Hanun, son of Nahash, for his father was kind to me.” So David sent messengers to comfort him over his father's death. David's ambassadors arrived in the land of the Ammonites and went to comfort Hanun."
1 Chronicles,19,3,"But the Ammonite princes said to Hanun, “Do you really think that David is honoring your father by sending comforters to you? Haven't these ‘comforters’ only come to spy out the land to find ways to conquer it?”"
1 Chronicles,19,4,"So Hanun detained David's ambassadors and had them shaved, and their robes cut off at the buttocks. Then he sent them back."
1 Chronicles,19,5,"A message was sent to David to explain what had happened to the men. David then sent messengers to the men to tell them, “Stay at Jericho until your beards grow, and then you can come back.”"

1 Chronicles,19,7,"They also hired 32,000 chariots and the king of Maacah with his army. They came set up camp near Medeba. The Ammonites were also called up from their towns and prepared for battle."

1 Chronicles,19,13,"Be brave, and fight your best for our people and the towns of our God. May the Lord do what he sees as good!”"
1 Chronicles,19,14,Joab attacked the Arameans with his forces and they ran away from him.
1 Chronicles,19,15,"When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had run away, they also ran away from Abishai, Joab's brother, and retreated into the town. So Joab went back to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,19,16,"As soon as the Arameans saw they had been defeated by the Israelites they sent for reinforcements from the other side of the Euphrates River, under the leadership of Shobach, commander of Hadadezer's army."
1 Chronicles,19,17,"When this was reported to David, he assembled all Israel together. He crossed the Jordan and approached the Aramean army, drawing up his forces in battle line against them. When David engaged in battle with them they fought with him."
1 Chronicles,19,18,"But the Aramean army ran away from the Israelites, and David killed 7,000 charioteers and 40,000 infantry, as well as Shobach, their army commander."
1 Chronicles,19,19,"When Hadadezer's allies realized that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. As a result, the Arameans didn't want to help the Ammonites any more."
1 Chronicles,20,1,"In spring, at the time of year when kings go out to make war, Joab led the Israelite army in attacks against the country of the Ammonites, also besieging Rabbah. However, David remained behind in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and destroyed it."
1 Chronicles,20,2,"David took the crown from the head of their idol Milcom. It was made of gold, and was set with gems. It weighed a talent and was placed on David's head. David also took a great deal of plunder from the city."
1 Chronicles,20,3,"David made the people there work with saws, iron picks, and axes. He also did the same to all the Ammonite towns. Then David and all his army returned to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,20,4,"Some time after this war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. But then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, a descendant of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were forced to submit."

1 Chronicles,20,8,"These were the descendants of the giants in Gath, but they were all killed by David and his men."
1 Chronicles,21,1,Satan interfered to cause trouble for Israel. He provoked David to do a census of Israel.
1 Chronicles,21,2,"So David told Joab and the army commanders, “Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then report back to me so I can have a total number.”"
1 Chronicles,21,3,"But Joab replied, “May the Lord multiply his people a hundred times over. Your Majesty, aren't they all your subjects? Why do you want to do this? Why should you make Israel guilty?”"
1 Chronicles,21,4,But the king was adamant so Joab left and went all over Israel. Eventually he returned to Jerusalem
1 Chronicles,21,5,"and he gave David the number of people censused. In Israel there were 1,100,000 fighting men who could handle a sword, and 470,000 in Judah."
1 Chronicles,21,6,"However, Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the census total, because he disagreed with what the king had ordered."
1 Chronicles,21,7,The Lord considered the census a bad thing to do and he punished Israel for it.
1 Chronicles,21,8,"Then David said to God, “I have committed a terrible sin by doing this. Please take away the guilt of your servant, for I have been very stupid.”"
1 Chronicles,21,9,"The Lord told Gad, David's seer"
1 Chronicles,21,10,"“Go and tell David that this is what the Lord says: ‘I'm giving you three options. Choose one of them, and that's what I'll do to you.’”"
1 Chronicles,21,11,"So Gad went and told David, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Make your choice"
1 Chronicles,21,12,"either three years of famine; or three months of devastation, running from the swords of your enemies; or three days of the Lord's sword—in other words three days of plague in the land, with an angel of the Lord causing destruction throughout the whole of Israel.’ Now you have to decide how I should reply to the one who sent me.”"
1 Chronicles,21,13,"David replied to Gad, “This is an awful situation for me! Please, let the Lord decide my punishment, for he is so merciful. Don't let me be punished by people.”"
1 Chronicles,21,14,"So the Lord a plague on Israel, and 70,000 Israelites died."
1 Chronicles,21,15,"God also sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But just as the angel was about to destroy it, the Lord saw it, and he relented from causing such a disaster. He told the destroying angel, “That's enough. You can stop now.” Right then the angel of the Lord was standing beside the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite."
1 Chronicles,21,16,"When David looked up and saw the angel of the Lord standing between earth and heaven, holding his drawn sword extended over Jerusalem, David and the elders, wearing sackcloth, fell on their faces."
1 Chronicles,21,17,"David said to God, “Wasn't it me who ordered the census of the people? I'm the one who has sinned and acted wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Lord my God, please punish me and my family, but don't punish your people with this plague.”"
1 Chronicles,21,18,Then the angel of the Lord told Gad to tell David to go and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles,21,19,So David went and did what Gad had told him in the name of the Lord.
1 Chronicles,21,20,Ornan was busy threshing wheat. He turned around and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him went and hid.
1 Chronicles,21,21,"When David arrived, Ornan looked out and saw David. He left the threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground."
1 Chronicles,21,22,"David said to Ornan, “Please let me have the threshing floor. I'll buy it at its full price. Then I can build an altar to the Lord here so that the plague on the people may be stopped.”"
1 Chronicles,21,23,"“Take it, and Your Majesty can do whatever you want with it,” Ornan told David. “You can have the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing boards for firewood, and the wheat for a grain offering. I'll give it all to you.”"
1 Chronicles,21,24,"“No, I insist, I will pay the full price,” replied King David “I won't take for the Lord what is yours or present burnt offerings that didn't cost me anything.”"
1 Chronicles,21,25,So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold for the place.
1 Chronicles,21,26,"David built an altar to the Lord there and presented burnt offerings and friendship offerings. He called on the Lord in prayer, and the Lord answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering."
1 Chronicles,21,27,Then the Lord told the angel to put his sword back into its sheath.
1 Chronicles,21,28,"When David saw that the Lord had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there."
1 Chronicles,21,29,"At that time the tent of the Lord that Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at the high place in Gibeon."
1 Chronicles,21,30,"But David did not want to go there to ask God's will, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the Lord."
1 Chronicles,22,1,"Then David said, “This is where the house of the Lord God will be, and this is the place for the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”"
1 Chronicles,22,2,"So David gave orders to summon the foreigners living in the land of Israel, and he assigned stonecutters to prepare dressed stones to build the house of God."
1 Chronicles,22,3,"David provided plenty of iron to make the nails for the entrance doors and for the supports, as well as more bronze than could be weighed."
1 Chronicles,22,4,"He provided more cedar logs than could be counted, because the people of Sidon and Tyre had brought a huge quantity of cedar logs to David."
1 Chronicles,22,5,"David said to himself, “My son Solomon is still young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the Lord must be truly magnificent, famous and glorious around the world. I need to start preparing for it.” So David made sure plenty of building materials were ready before he died."
1 Chronicles,22,6,"Then he sent for his son Solomon and instructed him to build a house for the Lord, the God of Israel."
1 Chronicles,22,7,"David told Solomon, “My son, I had always wanted to build a house to honor the Lord my God."
1 Chronicles,22,8,"But the Lord told me, ‘You have shed a lot of blood and engaged in many wars. You are not to build a house to honor me because I have seen you shed so much blood on the earth."
1 Chronicles,22,9,"But you will have a son who will be a man of peace. I will give him peace from all his enemies in the nations around. Solomon will be his name, and I will grant peace and quiet to Israel during his reign."
1 Chronicles,22,10,"He is the one who will build a house to honor me. He will be my son, and I will be his father. And I will make sure the throne of his kingdom over Israel lasts forever.’"
1 Chronicles,22,11,"Now, my son, may the Lord be with you so you may succeed in building the house of the Lord your God, just as he said you would."
1 Chronicles,22,12,"Only may the Lord give you insight and understanding when he puts you in command of Israel, so that you may keep the law of the Lord your God."
1 Chronicles,22,13,"Then you will be successful, as long as you are careful to follow the laws and regulations that the Lord through Moses instructed Israel to do. Be strong and be brave! Don't be afraid or discouraged!"
1 Chronicles,22,14,"Look, I've taken a lot of trouble to provide for the house of the Lord— 100,000 talents of gold, 1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron, more than can be weighed."
1 Chronicles,22,15,"I have also provided timber and stone, but you will need to add more."
1 Chronicles,22,16,"You have many workers such as stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and all kinds of craftsmen of gold, silver, bronze, and iron—without limit. So get started, and may the Lord be with you!”"
1 Chronicles,22,17,David also ordered all the leaders in Israel to help his son Solomon.
1 Chronicles,22,18,"“Isn't the Lord God with you? Hasn't he given you peace on all your borders?” he asked. “Why? Because he has placed the inhabitants of the land under my power, and they are now subject to the Lord and to his people."
1 Chronicles,22,19,"Now, with your whole mind and heart, make a definite decision to always worship the Lord your God. Get started on building the sanctuary of the Lord God, Then you can bring the Ark of the Lord's Agreement and the holy things of God into the house that is to be built to honor the Lord.”"
1 Chronicles,23,1,"When David was old, having lived a long life, he made his son Solomon king of Israel."
1 Chronicles,23,2,"He also summoned all the leaders of Israel, the priests, and the Levites."
