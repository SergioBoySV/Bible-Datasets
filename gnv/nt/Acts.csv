Acts,5,27,"And when they had brought them, they set them before the Councill, and the chiefe Priest asked them,"
Acts,5,28,"Saying, Did not we straightly commaund you, that ye should not teach in this Name? and behold, ye haue filled Hierusale with your doctrine, and ye would bring this mans blood vpon vs."

Acts,5,35,"And sayd vnto them, Men of Israel, take heede to your selues, what ye intende to doe touching these men."
Acts,5,36,"For before these times, rose vp Theudas boasting himselfe, to whom resorted a number of men, about a foure hundreth, who was slaine: and they all which obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought."
Acts,5,37,"After this man, arose vp Iudas of Galile, in the dayes of the tribute, and drewe away much people after him: hee also perished, and all that obeyed him, were scattered abroad."
Acts,5,38,"And nowe I say vnto you, Refraine your selues from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsell, or this worke be of men, it will come to nought:"

Acts,15,21,"For Moses of olde time hath in euery citie them that preache him, seeing he is read in the Synagogues euery Sabbath day."
Acts,15,22,"Then it seemed good to the Apostles and Elders with the whole Church, to sende chosen men of their owne companie to Antiochia with Paul and Barnabas: to wit, Iudas whose surname was Barsabas and Silas, which were chiefe men among the brethren,"
Acts,15,23,"And wrote letters by them after this maner, THE APOSTLES, and the Elders, and the brethren, vnto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antiochia, and in Syria, and in Cilicia, send greeting."
Acts,15,24,"Forasmuch as we haue heard, that certaine which went out from vs, haue troubled you with wordes, and cumbred your mindes, saying, Ye must be circumcised and keepe the Lawe: to whom we gaue no such commandement,"
Acts,15,25,"It seemed therefore good to vs, when we were come together with one accord, to send chosen men vnto you, with our beloued Barnabas and Paul,"
Acts,15,26,Men that haue giuen vp their liues for the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ.
Acts,15,27,"We haue therefore sent Iudas and Silas, which shall also tell you ye same things by mouth."
Acts,15,28,"For it seemed good to the holy Ghost, and to vs, to lay no more burden vpon you, then these necessary things,"

Acts,15,35,"Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antiochia, teaching and preaching with many other, the worde of the Lord."
Acts,15,36,"But after certaine dayes, Paul said vnto Barnabas, Let vs returne, and visite our brethren in euery citie, where we haue preached the worde of the Lord, and see how they doe."

Acts,16,2,"Of whom the brethren which were at Lystra and Iconium, reported well."

Acts,16,4,"And as they went through the cities, they deliuered them the decrees to keepe, ordeined of the Apostles and Elders, which were at Hierusalem."
Acts,16,5,"And so were the Churches stablished in the faith, and encreased in number daily."
Acts,16,6,"Nowe when they had gone throughout Phrygia, and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden of the holy Ghost to preache the worde in Asia."
Acts,16,7,"Then came they to Mysia, and sought to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not."
Acts,16,8,"Therefore they passed through Mysia, and came downe to Troas,"
Acts,16,9,"Where a vision appeared to Paul in the night. There stoode a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come into Macedonia, and helpe vs."

Acts,16,16,"And it came to passe that as we went to prayer, a certaine maide hauing a spirit of diuination, mette vs, which gate her masters much vantage with diuining."
Acts,16,17,"She followed Paul and vs, and cryed, saying, These men are the seruants of the most high God, which shewe vnto you the way of saluation."
Acts,16,18,"And this did she many dayes: but Paul being grieued, turned about, and said to the spirit, I commaund thee in the Name of Iesus Christ, that thou come out of her. And he came out the same houre."
Acts,16,19,"Nowe when her masters sawe that the hope of their gaine was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drewe them into the market place vnto the Magistrates,"
Acts,16,20,"And brought them to the gouernours, saying, These men which are Iewes, trouble our citie,"

Acts,16,24,"Who hauing receiued such commandement, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feete fast in the stockes."
Acts,16,25,"Nowe at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sung Psalmes vnto God: and the prisoners heard them."
Acts,16,26,"And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundation of the prison was shaken: and by and by all the doores opened, and euery mans bands were loosed."

Acts,16,30,"And brought them out, and said, Syrs, what must I doe to be saued?"
Acts,16,31,"And they saide, Beleeue in the Lord Iesus Christ, and thou shalt be saued, and thine houshold."
Acts,16,32,"And they preached vnto him the worde of the Lord, and to all that were in the house."
Acts,16,33,"Afterwarde he tooke them the same houre of the night, and washed their stripes, and was baptized with all that belonged vnto him, straigthway."

Acts,16,35,"And when it was day, the gouernours sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men goe."
Acts,16,36,"Then the keeper of the prison tolde these woordes vnto Paul, saying, The gouerness haue sent to loose you: nowe therefore get you hence, and goe in peace."
Acts,16,37,"Then sayde Paul vnto them, After that they haue beaten vs openly vncodemned, which are Romanes, they haue cast vs into prison, and nowe would they put vs out priuily? nay verely: but let them come and bring vs out."
Acts,16,38,"And the sergeants tolde these woordes vnto the gouernours, who feared whe they heard that they were Romanes."
Acts,16,39,"Then came they and praied them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the citie."
Acts,16,40,"And they went out of the prison, and entred into the house of Lydia: and when they had seene the brethren, they comforted them, and departed."
Acts,17,1,"Nowe as they passed through Amphipolis, and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a Synagogue of the Iewes."
Acts,17,2,"And Paul, as his maner was, went in vnto them, and three Sabbath daies disputed with them by the Scriptures,"
Acts,17,3,"Opening, and alleadging that Christ must haue suffered, and risen againe from the dead: and this is Iesus Christ, whom, said he, I preach to you."
Acts,17,4,"And some of them beleeued, and ioyned in companie with Paul and Silas: also of the Grecians that feared God a great multitude, and of the chiefe women not a fewe."
Acts,17,5,"But the Iewes which beleeued not, mooued with enuie, tooke vnto them certaine vagabonds and wicked fellowes, and whe they had assembled the multitude, they made a tumult in the citie, and made assault against the house of Iason, and sought to bring them out to the people."
Acts,17,6,"But when they found them not, they drew Iason and certaine brethren vnto the heads of the citie, crying, These are they which haue subuerted the state of the world, and here they are,"
Acts,17,7,"Whom Iason hath receiued, and these all doe against the decrees of Cesar, saying that there is another King, one Iesus."
Acts,17,8,"Then they troubled the people, and the heads of the citie, when they heard these things."
Acts,17,9,"Notwithstanding when they had receiued sufficient assurance of Iason and of the other, they let them goe."
Acts,17,10,"And the brethren immediatly sent away Paul and Silas by night vnto Berea, which when they were come thither, entred into ye Synagogue of the Iewes."
Acts,17,11,"These were also more noble men then they which were at Thessalonica, which receiued the woorde with all readinesse, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so."
Acts,17,12,"Therefore many of them beleeued, and of honest women, which were Grecians, and men not a fewe."
Acts,17,13,"But when the Iewes of Thessalonica knewe, that the woord of God was also preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and mooued the people."
Acts,17,14,But by and by the brethren sent away Paul to goe as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.
Acts,17,15,"And they that did conduct Paul, brought him vnto Athens: and when they had receiued a commandement vnto Silas and Timotheus that they shoulde come to him at once, they departed."
Acts,17,16,"Nowe while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirite was stirred in him, when hee sawe the citie subiect to idolatrie."
Acts,17,17,"Therefore he disputed in the Synagogue with the Iewes, and with them that were religious, and in the market daily with whomesoeuer he met."
Acts,17,18,"Then certaine Philosophers of the Epicures, and of the Stoickes, disputed with him, and some sayde, What will this babler say? Others sayde, He seemeth to be a setter forth of straunge gods (because hee preached vnto them Iesus, and the resurrection.)"
Acts,17,19,"And they tooke him, and brought him into Mars streete, saying, May we not know, what this newe doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?"
Acts,17,20,"For thou bringest certaine strange thinges vnto our eares: we woulde knowe therefore, what these things meane."
Acts,17,21,"For all the Athenians, and strangers which dwelt there, gaue them selues to nothing els, but either to tell, or to heare some newes."
Acts,17,22,"Then Paul stoode in the mids of Mars streete, and sayde, Yee men of Athens, I perceiue that in all things yee are too superstitious."
Acts,17,23,"For as I passed by, and behelde your deuotions, I founde an altar wherein was written, VNTO THE VNKNOWEN GOD. Whom ye then ignorantly worship, him shewe I vnto you."
Acts,17,24,"God that made the world, and all things that are therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaue and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands,"
Acts,17,25,"Neither is worshipped with mens handes, as though he needed any thing, seeing hee giueth to all life and breath and all things,"
Acts,17,26,"And hath made of one blood all mankinde, to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath assigned the seasons which were ordeined before, and the boundes of their habitation,"
Acts,17,27,"That they shoulde seeke the Lord, if so be they might haue groped after him, and founde him though doubtlesse he be not farre from euery one of vs."
Acts,17,28,"For in him we liue, and mooue, and haue our being, as also certaine of your owne Poets haue sayd, for we are also his generation."
Acts,17,29,"Forasmuch then, as we are the generation of God, we ought not to thinke that ye Godhead is like vnto gold, or siluer, or stone grauen by arte and the inuention of man."
Acts,17,30,"And the time of this ignorance God regarded not: but nowe hee admonisheth all men euery where to repent,"
Acts,17,31,"Because hee hath appoynted a day in the which he wil iudge the world in righteousnes, by that man whome hee hath appoynted, whereof he hath giuen an assurance to all men, in that hee hath raised him from the dead."
Acts,17,32,"Now when they heard of the resurrection from the dead, some mocked, and other sayde, We will heare thee againe of this thing."
Acts,17,33,And so Paul departed from among them.
Acts,17,34,"Howbeit certaine men claue vnto Paul, and beleeued: among whome was also Denys Areopagita, and a woman named Damaris, and other with them."
Acts,18,1,"After these thinges, Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinthus,"
Acts,18,2,"And found a certaine Iewe named Aquila, borne in Pontus, lately come from Italie, and his wife Priscilla (because that Claudius had commanded all Iewes to depart from Rome) and he came vnto them."
Acts,18,3,"And because hee was of the same crafte, he abode with them and wrought (for their crafte was to make tentes.)"
Acts,18,4,"And he disputed in the Synagogue euery Sabbath day, and exhorted the Iewes, and the Grecians."
Acts,18,5,"Now when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul, forced in spirit, testified to the Iewes that Iesus was the Christ."
Acts,18,6,"And when they resisted and blasphemed, he shooke his raiment, and saide vnto them, Your blood be vpon your owne head: I am cleane: from henceforth will I goe vnto the Gentiles."
Acts,18,7,"So he departed thence, and entred into a certaine mans house, named Iustus, a worshipper of God, whose house ioyned hard to the Synagogue."
Acts,18,8,"And Crispus the chiefe ruler of the Synagogue, beleeued in the Lord with all his housholde: and many of the Corinthians hearing it, beleeued and were baptized."
Acts,18,9,"Then saide the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Feare not, but speake, and holde not thy peace."
Acts,18,10,"For I am with thee, and no man shall lay handes on thee to hurt thee: for I haue much people in this citie."
Acts,18,11,"So he continued there a yeere and six moneths, and taught ye worde of God among them."
Acts,18,12,"Now when Gallio was Deputie of Achaia, the Iewes arose with one accorde against Paul, and brought him to the iudgement seate,"
Acts,18,13,"Saying, This fellow persuadeth me to worship God otherwise then the Lawe appointeth."
Acts,18,14,"And as Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio saide vnto the Iewes, If it were a matter of wrong, or an euill deede, O ye Iewes, I would according to reason maintaine you."
Acts,18,15,"But if it bee a question of woordes, and names, and of your Lawe, looke yee to it your selues: for I will be no iudge of those things."
Acts,18,16,And hee draue them from the iudgement seate.
Acts,18,17,"Then tooke al the Grecians Sosthenes the chiefe ruler of the Synagogue, and beat him before the iudgement seat: but Gallio cared nothing for those things."
Acts,18,18,"But when Paul had taried there yet a good while, hee tooke leaue of the brethren, and sailed into Syria (and with him Priscilla and Aquila) after that he had shorne his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vowe."
Acts,18,19,"Then hee came to Ephesus, and left them there: but hee entred into the Synagogue and disputed with the Iewes."
Acts,18,20,"Who desired him to tarie a longer time with them: but he would not consent,"
Acts,18,21,"But bade the farewel, saying, I must needes keepe this feast that commeth, in Hierusalem: but I will returne againe vnto you, if God will. So he sailed from Ephesus."
Acts,18,22,"And when hee came downe to Cesarea, he went vp to Hierusalem: and when he had saluted the Church, he went downe vnto Antiochia."
Acts,18,23,"Nowe when he had taried there a while, he departed, and went thorowe the countrey of Galatia and Phrygia by order, strengthening all the disciples."
Acts,18,24,"And a certaine Iewe named Apollos, borne at Alexandria, came to Ephesus, an eloquent man, and mightie in the Scriptures."
Acts,18,25,"The same was instructed in the way of the Lord, and hee spake feruently in the Spirite, and taught diligently the things of the Lord, and knew but the baptisme of Iohn onely."
Acts,18,26,"And he began to speake boldely in the Synagogue. Whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they tooke him vnto them, and expounded vnto him the way of God more perfectly."
Acts,18,27,"And when hee was minded to goe into Achaia, the brethren exhorting him, wrote to the disciples to receiue him: and after hee was come thither, he holpe them much which had beleeued through grace."
Acts,18,28,"For mightily hee confuted publikely the Iewes, with great vehemencie, shewing by the Scriptures, that Iesus was that Christ."
Acts,19,1,"And it came to passe, while Apollos was at Corinthus, that Paul when he passed thorow the vpper coasts, came to Ephesus, and found certaine disciples,"
Acts,19,2,"And saide vnto them, Haue ye receiued the holy Ghost since ye beleeued? And they saide vnto him, Wee haue not so much as heard whether there be an holy Ghost."
Acts,19,3,"And he said vnto them, Vnto what were ye then baptized? And they saide, Vnto Iohns baptisme."
Acts,19,4,"Then saide Paul, Iohn verely baptized with the baptisme of repentance, saying vnto the people, that they shoulde beleeue in him, which should come after him, that is, in Christ Iesus."
Acts,19,5,"And when they heard it, they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Iesus."
Acts,19,6,"So Paul layde his handes vpon them, and the holy Ghost came on them, and they spake the tongues, and prophecied."
Acts,19,7,And all the men were about twelue.
Acts,19,8,"Moreouer he went into the Synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three moneths, disputing and exhorting to the things that appertaine to the kingdome of God."
Acts,19,9,"But when certaine were hardened, and disobeyed, speaking euill of the way of God before the multitude, hee departed from them, and separated the disciples, and disputed dayly in the schoole of one Tyrannus."
Acts,19,10,"And this was done by the space of two yeeres, so that all they which dwelt in Asia, heard the word of ye Lord Iesus, both Iewes and Grecians."
Acts,19,11,"And God wrought no small miracles by the handes of Paul,"
Acts,19,12,"So that from his body were brought vnto the sicke, kerchefs or handkerchefs, and the diseases departed from them, and the euill spirits went out of them."
Acts,19,13,"Then certaine of the vagabond Iewes, exorcistes, tooke in hand to name ouer them which had euil spirits, the Name of the Lord Iesus, saying, We adiure you by Iesus, whom Paul preacheth."
Acts,19,14,"(And there were certaine sonnes of Sceua a Iewe, the Priest, about seuen which did this)"
Acts,19,15,"And the euil spirit answered, and said, Iesus I acknowledge, and Paul I know: but who are ye?"
Acts,19,16,"And the man in whome the euil spirit was, ranne on them, and ouercame them, and preuailed against them, so that they fledde out of that house, naked, and wounded."
Acts,19,17,"And this was knowen to all the Iewes and Grecians also, which dwelt at Ephesus, and feare came on them all, and the Name of the Lord Iesus was magnified,"
Acts,19,18,"And many that beleeued, came and confessed, and shewed their workes."
Acts,19,19,"Many also of them which vsed curious artes, brought their bookes, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fiftie thousand pieces of siluer."
Acts,19,20,"So the worde of God grewe mightily, and preuailed."
Acts,19,21,"Nowe when these things were accomplished, Paul purposed by the Spirite to passe through Macedonia and Achaia, and to goe to Hierusalem, saying, After I haue bene there, I must also see Rome."
Acts,19,22,"So sent hee into Macedonia two of them that ministred vnto him, Timotheus and Erastus, but he remained in Asia for a season."
Acts,19,23,And the same time there arose no small trouble about that way.
Acts,19,24,"For a certaine man named Demetrius a siluersmith, which made siluer temples of Diana, brought great gaines vnto the craftesmen,"
Acts,19,25,"Whom he called together, with the workemen of like things, and saide, Syrs, ye knowe that by this craft we haue our goods:"
Acts,19,26,"Moreouer ye see and heare, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia this Paul hath perswaded, and turned away much people, saying, That they be not gods which are made with handes."
Acts,19,27,"So that not onely this thing is dangerous vnto vs, that this our portion shall be reproued, but also that the temple of the great goddesse Diana should be nothing esteemed, and that it would come to passe that her magnificence, which all Asia and the world worshippeth, should be destroyed."
Acts,19,28,"Now when they heard it, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians."
Acts,19,29,"And the whole citie was full of confusion, and they rushed into the common place with one assent, and caught Gaius, and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, and Pauls companions of his iourney."
Acts,19,30,"And when Paul would haue entred in vnto the people, the disciples suffred him not."
Acts,19,31,"Certaine also of the chiefe of Asia which were his friendes, sent vnto him, desiring him that hee woulde not present him selfe in the Common place."
Acts,19,32,"Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assemblie was out of order, and the more part knewe not wherefore they were come together."
Acts,19,33,"And some of the company drew foorth Alexander, the Iewes thrusting him forwards. Alexander then beckened with the hande, and woulde haue excused the matter to the people."
Acts,19,34,"But when they knew that he was a Iewe, there arose a shoute almost for the space of two houres, of all men crying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians."
Acts,19,35,"Then the towne clearke when hee had stayed the people, saide, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is it that knoweth not howe that the citie of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddesse Diana, and of the image, which came downe from Iupiter?"
Acts,19,36,"Seeing then that no man can speake against these things, ye ought to be appeased, and to doe nothing rashly."
Acts,19,37,"For yee haue brought hither these men, which haue neither committed sacrilege, neither doe blaspheme your goddesse."
Acts,19,38,"Wherefore, if Demetrius and the craftes men which are with him, haue a matter against any man, the lawe is open, and there are Deputies: let them accuse one another."
Acts,19,39,"But if ye inquire any thing cocerning other matters, it may be determined in a lawful assembly."
Acts,19,40,"For we are euen in ieopardie to be accused of this dayes sedition, for as much as there is no cause, whereby we may giue a reason of this concourse of people."
Acts,19,41,"And when he had thus spoken, hee let the assembly depart."
Acts,20,1,"Nowe after the tumult was appeased, Paul called the disciples vnto him, and embraced them, and departed to goe into Macedonia."
Acts,20,2,"And when hee had gone through those parts, and had exhorted them with many words, he came into Grecia."
Acts,20,3,"And hauing taried there three moneths, because the Iewes layde waite for him, as hee was about to saile into Syria, hee purposed to returne through Macedonia."
Acts,20,4,"And there accompanied him into Asia, Sopater of Berea, and of them of Thessalonica, Aristarchus, and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus, and of them of Asia, Tychicus, and Trophimus."
Acts,20,5,"These went before, and taried vs at Troas."
Acts,20,6,"And we sailed forth from Philippi, after the dayes of vnleauened bread, and came vnto them to Troas in fiue dayes, where we abode seuen dayes."
Acts,20,7,"And the first day of the weeke, the disciples being come together to breake bread, Paul preached vnto them, ready to depart on the morrow, and continued the preaching vnto midnight."
Acts,20,8,"And there were many lightes in an vpper chamber, where they were gathered together."
Acts,20,9,"And there sate in a windowe a certaine yong man, named Eutychus, fallen into a dead sleepe: and as Paul was long preaching, hee ouercome with sleepe, fell downe from the thirde loft, and was taken vp dead."
Acts,20,10,"But Paul went downe, and layde himselfe vpon him, and embraced him, saying, Trouble not your selues: for his life is in him."
Acts,20,11,"Then when Paul was come vp againe, and had broken bread, and eaten, hauing spoken a long while till the dawning of the day, hee so departed."
Acts,20,12,"And they brought the boye aliue, and they were not a litle comforted."
Acts,20,13,"Then we went before to shippe, and sailed vnto the citie Assos, that wee might receiue Paul there: for so had hee appointed, and would himselfe goe afoote."
Acts,20,14,"Now when he was come vnto vs to Assos, and we had receiued him, we came to Mitylenes."
Acts,20,15,"And wee sailed thence, and came the next day ouer against Chios, and the next day we arriued at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium: the next day we came to Miletum."
Acts,20,16,"For Paul had determined to saile by Ephesus, because hee woulde not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted to be, if hee could possible, at Hierusalem, at the day of Pentecost."
Acts,20,17,"Wherefore from Miletum, hee sent to Ephesus, and called the Elders of the Church."
Acts,20,18,"Who when they were come to him, hee said vnto them, Ye know from the first day that I came into Asia, after what maner I haue bene with you at all seasons,"
Acts,20,19,"Seruing the Lord with all modestie, and with many teares, and tentations, which came vnto me by the layings awaite of the Iewes,"
Acts,20,20,"And how I kept backe nothing that was profitable, but haue shewed you, and taught you openly and throughout euery house,"
Acts,20,21,"Witnessing both to the Iewes, and to the Grecians the repentance towarde God, and faith toward our Lord Iesus Christ."
Acts,20,22,"And nowe beholde, I goe bound in the Spirit vnto Hierusalem, and know not what things shall come vnto me there,"
Acts,20,23,"Saue that ye holy Ghost witnesseth in euery citie, saying, that bondes and afflictions abide me."
Acts,20,24,"But I passe not at all, neither is my life deare vnto my selfe, so that I may fulfill my course with ioye, and the ministration which I haue receiued of the Lord Iesus, to testifie the Gospell of the grace of God."
Acts,20,25,"And now behold, I know that henceforth ye all, through whome I haue gone preaching the kingdome of God, shall see my face no more."
Acts,20,26,"Wherefore I take you to recorde this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men."
Acts,20,27,"For I haue kept nothing backe, but haue shewed you all the counsell of God."
Acts,20,28,"Take heede therefore vnto your selues, and to all the flocke, whereof the holy Ghost hath made you Ouerseers, to feede the Church of God, which hee hath purchased with that his owne blood."
Acts,20,29,"For I knowe this, that after my departing shall grieuous wolues enter in among you, not sparing the flocke."
Acts,20,30,"Moreouer of your owne selues shall men arise speaking peruerse thinges, to drawe disciples after them."
Acts,20,31,"Therefore watche, and remember, that by the space of three yeres I ceased not to warne euery one, both night and day with teares."
Acts,20,32,"And nowe brethren, I commend you to God, and to the worde of his grace, which is able to build further, and to giue you an inheritance, among all them, which are sanctified."
Acts,20,33,"I haue coueted no mans siluer, nor gold, nor apparell."
Acts,20,34,"Yea, ye knowe, that these handes haue ministred vnto my necessities, and to them that were with me."
Acts,20,35,"I haue shewed you all things, howe that so labouring, ye ought to support the weake, and to remember the wordes of the Lord Iesus, howe that hee saide, It is a blessed thing to giue, rather then to receiue."
Acts,20,36,"And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled downe, and prayed with them all."
Acts,20,37,"Then they wept all abundantly, and fell on Pauls necke, and kissed him,"
Acts,20,38,"Being chiefly sorie for the words which he spake, That they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him vnto the shippe."
Acts,21,1,"And as we launched forth, and were departed from them, we came with a straight course vnto Coos, and the day following vnto the Rhodes, and from thence vnto Patara."
Acts,21,2,"And we found a ship that went ouer vnto Phenice, and went aboard, and set forth."
Acts,21,3,"And whe we had discouered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed toward Syria, and arriued at Tyrus: for there the ship vnladed ye burden."
Acts,21,4,"And when we had found disciples, we taried there seuen dayes. And they told Paul through the Spirit, that he should not goe vp to Hierusalem."
Acts,21,5,"But when the dayes were ended, we departed and went our way, and they all accompanied vs with their wiues and children, euen out of the citie: and we kneeling downe on the shore, prayed."
Acts,21,6,"Then when we had embraced one another, we tooke ship, and they returned home."
Acts,21,7,"And when we had ended the course from Tyrus, we arriued at Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day."
Acts,21,8,"And the next day, Paul and we that were with him, departed, and came vnto Cesarea: and we entred into the house of Philippe the Euangelist, which was one of the seuen Deacons, and abode with him."
Acts,21,9,"Now he had foure daughters virgins, which did prophecie."
Acts,21,10,"And as we taried there many dayes, there came a certaine Prophet from Iudea, named Agabus."
Acts,21,11,"And when he was come vnto vs, he tooke Pauls girdle, and bound his owne hands and feete, and sayd, Thus sayth the holy Ghost, So shall the Iewes at Hierusalem binde the man that oweth this girdle, and shall deliuer him into the hands of the Gentiles."
Acts,21,12,"And when we had heard these things, both we and other of the same place besought him that he would not go vp to Hierusalem."
Acts,21,13,"Then Paul answered, and sayd, What doe ye weeping and breaking mine heart? For I am ready not to be bound onely, but also to die at Hierusalem for the Name of the Lord Iesus."
Acts,21,14,"So when he would not be perswaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done."
Acts,21,15,"And after those dayes we trussed vp our fardels, and went vp to Hierusalem."
Acts,21,16,"There went with vs also certaine of the disciples of Cesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an olde disciple, with whome we should lodge."
Acts,21,17,"And when we were come to Hierusalem, the brethren receiued vs gladly."
Acts,21,18,And the next day Paul went in with vs vnto Iames: and all the Elders were there assembled.
Acts,21,19,"And when he had embraced them, hee tolde by order all things, that God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministration."
Acts,21,20,"So when they heard it, they glorified God, and sayd vnto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousand Iewes there are which beleeue, and they are all zealous of the Law:"
Acts,21,21,"Now they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Iewes, which are among the Gentiles, to forsake Moses, and sayest that they ought not to circumcise their sonnes, neither to liue after the customes."
Acts,21,22,What is then to be done? the multitude must needes come together: for they shall heare that thou art come.
Acts,21,23,"Doe therefore this that we say to thee. We haue foure men, which haue made a vowe,"
Acts,21,24,"Them take, and purifie thy selfe with them, and contribute with them, that they may shaue their heads: and all shall knowe, that those things, whereof they haue bene informed concerning thee, are nothing, but that thou thy selfe also walkest and keepest the Lawe."
Acts,21,25,"For as touching ye Gentiles, which beleeue, we haue written, and determined that they obserue no such thing, but that they keepe themselues from things offred to idoles, and from blood, and from that that is strangled, and from fornication."
Acts,21,26,"Then Paul tooke the men, and the next day was purified with them, and entred into the Temple, declaring the accomplishment of the dayes of the purification, vntill that an offering should be offered for euery one of them."
Acts,21,27,"And when the seuen dayes were almost ended, the Iewes which were of Asia (when they sawe him in the Temple) moued all the people, and laide hands on him,"
Acts,21,28,"Crying, Men of Israel, helpe: this is the man that teacheth all men euery where against the people, and the Lawe, and this place: moreouer, he hath brought Grecians into the Temple, and hath polluted this holy place."
Acts,21,29,"For they had seene before Trophimus an Ephesian with him in the citie, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the Temple."
Acts,21,30,"Then all the citie was moued, and the people ran together: and they tooke Paul and drewe him out of the Temple, and forth with the doores were shut."
Acts,21,31,"But as they went about to kill him, tydings came vnto the chiefe captaine of the band, that all Hierusalem was on an vproare."
Acts,21,32,"Who immediately tooke souldiers and Centurions, and ran downe vnto them: and when they sawe the chiefe Captaine and the souldiers, they left beating of Paul."
Acts,21,33,"Then the chiefe Captaine came neere and tooke him, and commanded him to be bound with two chaines, and demaunded who he was, and what he had done."
Acts,21,34,"And one cryed this, another that, among the people. So when he could not know the certeintie for the tumult, he commanded him to be led into the castell."
Acts,21,35,"And when hee came vnto the grieces, it was so that he was borne of the souldiers, for the violence of the people."
Acts,21,36,"For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him."
Acts,21,37,"And as Paul should haue bene led into the castell, he sayd vnto the chiefe Captaine, May I speake vnto thee? Who sayd, Canst thou speake Greeke?"
Acts,21,38,"Art not thou the Egyptian who before these dayes raised a sedition, and led out into the wildernesse foure thousande men that were murtherers?"
Acts,21,39,"Then Paul sayde, Doubtlesse, I am a man which am a Iewe, and citizen of Tarsus, a famous citie of Cilicia, and I beseech thee, suffer mee to speake vnto the people."
Acts,21,40,"And when he had giuen him licence, Paul stoode on the grieces, and beckened with the hand vnto the people: and when there was made great silence, hee spake vnto them in the Hebrewe tongue, saying,"
Acts,22,1,"Ye men, brethren and Fathers, heare my defence nowe towards you."
Acts,22,2,"(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrewe tongue to them, they kept the more silence, and he sayd)"
Acts,22,3,"I am verely a man, which am a Iew, borne in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought vp in this citie at the feete of Gamaliel, and instructed according to the perfect maner of the Lawe of the Fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day."
Acts,22,4,"And I persecuted this way vnto the death, binding and deliuering into prison both men and women."
Acts,22,5,"As also ye chiefe Priest doeth beare me witnes, and al the company of the Elders: of whom also I receiued letters vnto the brethren, and went to Damascus to bring them which were there, bound vnto Hierusalem, that they might be punished."
Acts,22,6,"And so it was, as I iourneyed and was come neere vnto Damascus about noone, that suddenly there shone from heauen a great light round about me."
Acts,22,7,"So I fell vnto the earth, and heard a voyce, saying vnto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou mee?"
Acts,22,8,"Then I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Iesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest."
Acts,22,9,"Moreouer they that were with me, sawe in deede a light and were afraide: but they heard not the voyce of him that spake vnto me."
Acts,22,10,"Then I sayd, What shall I doe, Lord? And the Lord sayde vnto me, Arise, and goe into Damascus: and there it shall be tolde thee of all things, which are appointed for thee to doe."
Acts,22,11,"So when I could not see for the glory of that light, I was led by the hand of them that were with me, and came into Damascus."
Acts,22,12,"And one Ananias a godly man, as perteining to the Lawe, hauing good report of all the Iewes which dwelt there,"
Acts,22,13,"Came vnto me, and stoode, and sayd vnto me, Brother Saul, receiue thy sight: and that same houre I looked vpon him."
Acts,22,14,"And he sayd, The God of our fathers hath appointed thee, that thou shouldest knowe his wil, and shouldest see that Iust one, and shouldest heare the voyce of his mouth."
Acts,22,15,"For thou shalt be his witnes vnto all men, of the things which thou hast seene and heard."
Acts,22,16,"Now therefore why tariest thou? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sinnes, in calling on the Name of the Lord."
Acts,22,17,"And it came to passe, that when I was come againe to Hierusalem, and prayed in the Temple, I was in a traunce,"
Acts,22,18,"And saw him saying vnto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Hierusalem: for they will not receiue thy witnes concerning me."
Acts,22,19,"Then I sayd, Lord, they know that I prisoned, and beat in euery Synagogue them that beleeued in thee."
Acts,22,20,"And when the blood of thy martyr Steuen was shed, I also stood by, and consented vnto his death, and kept the clothes of them that slew him."
Acts,22,21,"Then he sayd vnto me, Depart: for I will send thee farre hence vnto the Gentiles."
Acts,22,22,"And they heard him vnto this worde, but then they lift vp their voyces, and sayd, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not meete that he should liue."
Acts,22,23,"And as they cried and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the aire,"
Acts,22,24,"The chiefe captaine commanded him to be led into the castle, and bade that he should be scourged, and examined, that he might knowe wherefore they cryed so on him."
Acts,22,25,"And as they bound him with thongs, Paul sayd vnto the Centurion that stood by, Is it lawfull for you to scourge one that is a Romane, and not condemned?"
Acts,22,26,"Nowe when the Centurion heard it, hee went, and tolde the chiefe captaine, saying, Take heede what thou doest: for this man is a Romane."
Acts,22,27,"Then the chiefe captaine came, and sayd to him, Tel me, art thou a Romane? And he said, Yea."
Acts,22,28,"And the chiefe captaine answered, With a great summe obtained I this freedome. Then Paul sayd, But I was so borne."
Acts,22,29,"Then straightway they departed from him, which should haue examined him: and the chiefe captaine also was afrayd, after he knewe that hee was a Romane, and that he had bound him."
Acts,22,30,"On the next day, because hee would haue knowen the certaintie wherefore he was accused of the Iewes, he loosed him from his bonds, and commanded the hie Priests and all their Councill to come together: and he brought Paul, and set him before them."
Acts,23,1,"And Paul behelde earnestly the Councill, and sayde, Men and brethren, I haue in all good conscience serued God vntill this day."
Acts,23,2,"Then the hie Priest Ananias commanded them that stood by, to smite him on the mouth."
Acts,23,3,"Then sayd Paul to him, God will smite thee, thou whited wall: for thou sittest to iudge me according to the Lawe, and transgressing the Lawe, commaundest thou me to be smitten?"
Acts,23,4,"And they that stood by, sayd, Reuilest thou Gods hie Priest?"
Acts,23,5,"Then sayd Paul, I knewe not, brethren, that he was the hie Priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speake euill of the ruler of thy people."
Acts,23,6,"But when Paul perceiued that the one part were of the Sadduces, and the other of the Pharises, hee cried in the Council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharise, the sonne of a Pharise: I am accused of the hope and resurrection of the dead."
Acts,23,7,"And when hee had saide this, there was a dissension betweene the Pharises and the Sadduces, so that the multitude was deuided."
Acts,23,8,"For the Sadduces say that there is no resurrection, neither Angel, nor spirit: but the Pharises confesse both."
Acts,23,9,"Then there was a great crye: and the Scribes of the Pharises part rose vp, and stroue, saying, Wee finde none euill in this man: but if a spirit or an Angel hath spoken to him, let vs not fight against God."
Acts,23,10,"And when there was a great dissension, the chiefe captaine, fearing lest Paul should haue bene pulled in pieces of them, commanded the souldiers to go downe, and take him from among them, and to bring him into the castel."
Acts,23,11,"Nowe the night folowing, the Lord stoode by him, and saide, Be of good courage, Paul: for as thou hast testified of mee in Hierusalem, so must thou beare witnesse also at Rome."
Acts,23,12,"And when the day was come, certaine of the Iewes made an assemblie, and bounde themselues with a curse, saying, that they woulde neither eate nor drinke, till they had killed Paul."
Acts,23,13,"And they were more then fourtie, which had made this conspiracie."
Acts,23,14,"And they came to the chiefe Priestes and Elders, and said, We haue bound our selues with a solemne curse, that wee will eate nothing, vntill we haue slaine Paul."
Acts,23,15,"Nowe therefore, ye and the Council signifie to the chiefe captaine, that hee bring him foorth vnto you to morow: as though you would know some thing more perfectly of him, and we, or euer he come neere, will be readie to kill him."
Acts,23,16,"But when Pauls sisters sonne heard of their laying awaite, he went, and entred into the castel, and tolde Paul."
Acts,23,17,"And Paul called one of the Centurions vnto him, and said, Take this yong man hence vnto the chiefe captaine: for he hath a certaine thing to shewe him."
Acts,23,18,"So hee tooke him, and brought him to the chiefe captaine, and saide, Paul the prisoner called mee vnto him, and prayed mee to bring this yong man vnto thee, which hath some thing to say vnto thee."
Acts,23,19,"Then the chiefe captaine tooke him by the hande, and went apart with him alone, and asked him, What hast thou to shewe me?"
Acts,23,20,"And he saide, The Iewes haue conspired to desire thee, that thou wouldest bring foorth Paul to morow into the Council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly:"
Acts,23,21,"But let them not perswade thee: for there lie in waite for him of them, more then fourtie men, which haue bound themselues with a curse, that they will neither eate nor drinke, till they haue killed him: and nowe are they readie, and waite for thy promise."
Acts,23,22,"The chiefe captaine then let the yong man depart, after hee had charged him to vtter it to no man, that he had shewed him these things."
Acts,23,23,"And he called vnto him two certaine Centurions, saying, Make readie two hundred souldiers, that they may go to Cæsarea, and horsemen three score and ten, and two hundred with dartes, at the thirde houre of the night."
Acts,23,24,"And let them make readie an horse, that Paul being set on, may be brought safe vnto Felix the Gouernour."
Acts,23,25,And he wrote an epistle in this maner:
Acts,23,26,Claudius Lysias vnto the most noble Gouernour Felix sendeth greeting.
Acts,23,27,"As this man was taken of the Iewes, and shoulde haue bene killed of them, I came vpon them with the garison, and rescued him, perceiuing that he was a Romane."
Acts,23,28,"And when I would haue knowen the cause, wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their Council."
Acts,23,29,"There I perceiued that hee was accused of questions of their Lawe, but had no crime worthy of death, or of bondes."
Acts,23,30,"And when it was shewed me, how that the Iewes layd waite for the man, I sent him straightway to thee, and commanded his accusers to speake before thee the thinges that they had against him. Farewell."
Acts,23,31,"Then the souldiers as it was commanded them, tooke Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris."
Acts,23,32,"And the next day, they left the horsemen to goe with him, and returned vnto the Castel."
Acts,23,33,"Now when they came to Cæsarea, they deliuered the epistle to the Gouernour, and presented Paul also vnto him."
Acts,23,34,"So when the Gouernour had read it, hee asked of what prouince he was: and when he vnderstoode that he was of Cilicia,"
Acts,23,35,"I will heare thee, said he, when thine accusers also are come, and commanded him to bee kept in Herods iudgement hall."
Acts,24,1,"Now after fiue dayes, Ananias the hie Priest came downe with the Elders, and with Tertullus a certaine oratour, which appeared before the Gouernour against Paul."
Acts,24,2,"And when he was called foorth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that we haue obtained great quietnesse through thee, and that many worthy things are done vnto this nation through thy prouidence,"
Acts,24,3,"We acknowledge it wholy, and in all places most noble Felix, with all thankes,"
Acts,24,4,"But that I be not tedious vnto thee, I pray thee, that thou wouldest heare vs of thy courtesie a fewe wordes."
Acts,24,5,"Certainely we haue found this man a pestilent fellowe, and a moouer of sedition among all the Iewes throughout the world, and a chiefe maintainer of the secte of the Nazarites:"
Acts,24,6,"And hath gone about to pollute the Temple: therefore wee tooke him, and woulde haue iudged him according to our Lawe:"
Acts,24,7,"But the chiefe captaine Lysias came vpon vs, and with great violence tooke him out of our handes,"
Acts,24,8,Commanding his accusers to come to thee: of whom thou mayest (if thou wilt inquire) know all these things whereof we accuse him.
Acts,24,9,"And the Iewes likewise affirmed, saying that it was so."
Acts,24,10,"Then Paul, after that the gouernour had beckened vnto him that hee shoulde speake, answered, I do the more gladly answere for my selfe, for as much as I knowe that thou hast bene of many yeres a iudge vnto this nation,"
Acts,24,11,"Seeing that thou mayest knowe, that there are but twelue dayes since I came vp to worship in Hierusalem."
Acts,24,12,"And they neither found mee in the Temple disputing with any man, neither making vproare among the people, neither in the Synagogues, nor in the citie."
Acts,24,13,"Neither can they proue the things, whereof they now accuse me."
Acts,24,14,"But this I confesse vnto thee, that after the way (which they call heresie) so worship I the God of my fathers, beleeuing all things which are written in the Lawe and the Prophets,"
Acts,24,15,"And haue hope towardes God, that the resurrection of the dead, which they themselues looke for also, shalbe both of iust and vniust."
Acts,24,16,"And herein I endeuour my selfe to haue alway a cleare conscience towarde God, and toward men."
Acts,24,17,"Now after many yeres, I came and brought almes to my nation and offerings."
Acts,24,18,"At what time, certaine Iewes of Asia founde mee purified in the Temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult."
Acts,24,19,"Who ought to haue bene present before thee, and accuse me, if they had ought against me."
Acts,24,20,"Or let these themselues say, if they haue found any vniust thing in mee, while I stoode in the Council,"
Acts,24,21,"Except it be for this one voyce, that I cried standing among them, Of the resurrection of the dead am I accused of you this day."
Acts,24,22,"Nowe when Felix heard these things, he deferred them, and said, When I shall more perfectly know the things which concerne this way, by the comming of Lysias the chiefe Captaine, I will decise your matter."
Acts,24,23,"Then hee commanded a Centurion to keepe Paul, and that he should haue ease, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister vnto him, or to come vnto him."
Acts,24,24,"And after certaine dayes, came Felix with his wife Drusilla, which was a Iewesse, and he called foorth Paul, and heard him of the faith in Christ."
Acts,24,25,"And as he disputed of righteousnes and temperance, and of the iudgement to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time, and when I haue conuenient time, I will call for thee."
Acts,24,26,"Hee hoped also that money shoulde haue bene giuen him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore hee sent for him the oftner, and communed with him."
Acts,24,27,"When two yeeres were expired, Porcius Festus came into Felix roume: and Felix willing to get fauour of the Iewes, left Paul bound."
Acts,25,1,"When Festus was then come into the prouince, after three dayes he went vp from Caesarea vnto Hierusalem."
Acts,25,2,"Then the high Priest, and the chiefe of the Iewes appeared before him against Paul: and they besought him,"
Acts,25,3,"And desired fauour against him, that hee would send for him to Hierusalem: and they layd waite to kill him by the way."
Acts,25,4,"But Festus answered, that Paul should bee kept at Caesarea, and that he himselfe would shortly depart thither."
Acts,25,5,"Let them therefore, saide he, which among you are able, come downe with vs: and if there be any wickednes in the man, let them accuse him."
Acts,25,6,"Now when he had taried among them no more then ten dayes, hee went downe to Caesarea, and the next day sate in the iudgement seat, and commanded Paul to be brought."
Acts,25,7,"And when hee was come, the Iewes which were come from Hierusalem, stoode about him and layd many and grieuous complaints against Paul, whereof they could make no plaine proofe,"
Acts,25,8,"Forasmuch as he answered, that he had neither offended any thing against the lawe of the Iewes, neither against ye temple, nor against Caesar."
Acts,25,9,"Yet Festus willing to get fauour of the Iewes, answered Paul and saide, Wilt thou goe vp to Hierusalem, and there be iudged of these things before mee?"
Acts,25,10,"Then said Paul, I stand at Caesars iudgment seate, where I ought to be iudged: to the Iewes I haue done no wrong, as thou very well knowest."
Acts,25,11,"For if I haue done wrong, or committed any thing worthie of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof they accuse me, no man, to pleasure them, can deliuer me to them: I appeale vnto Caesar."
Acts,25,12,"Then when Festus had spoken with the Council, hee answered, Hast thou appealed vnto Caesar? vnto Caesar shalt thou goe."
Acts,25,13,"And after certaine dayes, King Agrippa and Bernice came downe to Caesarea to salute Festus."
Acts,25,14,"And when they had remained there many dayes, Festus declared Pauls cause vnto the King, saying, There is a certaine man left in prison by Felix,"
Acts,25,15,"Of whom when I came to Hierusalem, the high Priestes and Elders of the Iewes informed me, and desired to haue iudgement against him."
Acts,25,16,"To whome I answered, that it is not the maner of the Romanes for fauour to deliuer any man to the death, before that hee which is accused, haue the accusers before him, and haue place to defend himselfe, concerning the crime."
Acts,25,17,"Therefore when they were come hither, without delay the day following I sate on the iudgement seate, and commanded the man to be brought foorth."
Acts,25,18,"Against whom when the accusers stood vp, they brought no crime of such things as I supposed:"
Acts,25,19,"But had certaine questions against him of their owne superstition, and of one Iesus which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be aliue."
Acts,25,20,"And because I doubted of such maner of question, I asked him whether he would goe to Hierusalem, and there be iudged of these things."
Acts,25,21,"But because he appealed to be reserued to the examination of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept, till I mght send him to Cesar."
Acts,25,22,"Then Agrippa sayd vnto Festus, I would also heare the man my selfe. To morowe, sayd he, thou shalt heare him."
Acts,25,23,"And on the morowe when Agrippa was come and Bernice with great pompe, and were entred into the Common hall with the chiefe captaines and chiefe men of the citie, at Festus commandement Paul was brought forth."
Acts,25,24,"And Festus sayd, King Agrippa, and all men which are present with vs, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Iewes haue called vpon me, both at Hierusalem, and here, crying, that he ought not to liue any longer."
Acts,25,25,"Yet haue I found nothing worthy of death, that he hath committed: neuertheles, seeing that he hath appealed to Augustus, I haue determined to send him."
Acts,25,26,"Of whome I haue no certaine thing to write vnto my Lord: wherefore I haue brought him forth vnto you, and specially vnto thee, King Agrippa, that after examination had, I might haue somewhat to write."
Acts,25,27,"For me thinketh it vnreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to shewe the causes which are layde against him."
Acts,26,1,"Then Agrippa sayd vnto Paul, Thou art permitted to speake for thy selfe. So Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himselfe."
Acts,26,2,"I thinke my selfe happy, King Agrippa, because I shall answere this day before thee of all the things whereof I am accused of the Iewes."
Acts,26,3,"Chiefly, because thou hast knowledge of all customes, and questions which are among the Iewes: wherefore I beseech thee, to heare me patiently."
Acts,26,4,"As touching my life from my childhood, and what it was from the beginning among mine owne nation at Hierusalem, know all the Iewes,"
Acts,26,5,"Which knewe me heretofore, euen from my elders (if they would testifie) that after the most straite sect of our religion I liued a Pharise."
Acts,26,6,And now I stand and am accused for the hope of the promise made of God vnto our fathers.
Acts,26,7,"Whereunto our twelue tribes instantly seruing God day and night, hope to come: for the which hopes sake, O King Agrippa, I am accused of the Iewes."
Acts,26,8,"Why should it be thought a thing incredible vnto you, that God should raise againe the dead?"
Acts,26,9,"I also verely thought in my selfe, that I ought to doe many contrarie things against the Name of Iesus of Nazareth."
Acts,26,10,"Which thing I also did in Hierusalem: for many of the Saints I shut vp in prison, hauing receiued authoritie of the hie Priests, and when they were put to death, I gaue my sentence."
Acts,26,11,"And I punished them throughout all the Synagogues, and compelled them to blaspheme, and being more mad against them, I persecuted them, euen vnto strange cities."
Acts,26,12,"At which time, euen as I went to Damascus with authoritie, and commission from the hie Priests,"
Acts,26,13,"At midday, O King, I sawe in the way a light from heauen, passing the brightnes of the sunne, shine round about mee, and them which went with me."
Acts,26,14,"So when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voyce speaking vnto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kicke against pricks."
Acts,26,15,"Then I sayd, Who art thou, Lord? And he sayd, I am Iesus whom thou persecutest."
Acts,26,16,"But rise and stand vp on thy feete: for I haue appeared vnto thee for this purpose, to appoint thee a minister and a witnesse, both of the things which thou hast seene, and of the things in the which I will appeare vnto thee,"
Acts,26,17,"Deliuering thee from this people, and from the Gentiles, vnto whom now I send thee,"
Acts,26,18,"To open their eyes, that they may turne from darknes to light, and from the power of Satan vnto God, that they may receiue forgiuenes of sinnes, and inheritance among them, which are sanctified by fayth in me."
Acts,26,19,"Wherefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient vnto the heauenly vision,"
Acts,26,20,"But shewed first vnto them of Damascus, and at Hierusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Iudea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turne to God, and doe workes worthy amendment of life."
Acts,26,21,"For this cause the Iewes caught me in the Temple, and went about to kill me."
Acts,26,22,"Neuertheles, I obteined helpe of God, and continue vnto this day, witnessing both to small and to great, saying none other things, then those which the Prophets and Moses did say should come,"
Acts,26,23,"To wit, that Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light vnto this people, and to the Gentiles."
Acts,26,24,"And as he thus answered for himselfe, Festus said with a loude voyce, Paul, thou art besides thy selfe: much learning doeth make thee mad."
Acts,26,25,"But he said, I am not mad, O noble Festus, but I speake the wordes of trueth and sobernes."
Acts,26,26,"For the King knoweth of these things, before whom also I speake boldly: for I am perswaded that none of these things are hidden from him: for this thing was not done in a corner."
Acts,26,27,"O King Agrippa, beleeuest thou the Prophets? I know that thou beleeuest."
Acts,26,28,"Then Agrippa said vnto Paul, Almost thou perswadest me to become a Christian."
Acts,26,29,"Then Paul sayd, I would to God that not onely thou, but also all that heare me to day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds."
Acts,26,30,"And when he had thus spoken, the King rose vp, and the gouernour, and Bernice, and they that sate with them."
Acts,26,31,"And when they were gone apart, they talked betweene themselues, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death, nor of bonds."
Acts,26,32,"Then sayd Agrippa vnto Festus, This man might haue bene loosed, if hee had not appealed vnto Cesar."
Acts,27,1,"Now when it was concluded, that we should sayle into Italie, they deliuered both Paul, and certaine other prisoners vnto a Centurion named Iulius, of the band of Augustus."
Acts,27,2,"And we entred into a ship of Adramyttium purposing to saile by the coastes of Asia, and launched foorth, and had Aristarchus of Macedonia, a Thessalonian, with vs."
Acts,27,3,"And the next day we arriued at Sidon: and Iulius courteously entreated Paul, and gaue him libertie to go vnto his friends, that they might refresh him."
Acts,27,4,"And from thence we launched, and sayled hard by Cyprus, because ye windes were contrarie."
Acts,27,5,"Then sayled we ouer the sea by Cilicia, and Pamphilia, and came to Myra, a citie in Lycia."
Acts,27,6,"And there the Centurion found a ship of Alexandria, sayling into Italie, and put vs therein."
Acts,27,7,"And when we had sayled slowly many dayes, and scarce were come against Gnidum, because the winde suffered vs not, we sailed hard by Candie, neere to Salmone,"
Acts,27,8,"And with much adoe sayled beyond it, and came vnto a certaine place called the Faire hauens, neere vnto the which was the citie Lasea."
Acts,27,9,"So when much time was spent, and sayling was now ieopardous, because also the Fast was nowe passed, Paul exhorted them,"
Acts,27,10,"And sayde vnto them, Syrs, I see that this voiage will be with hurt and much damage, not of the lading and ship onely, but also of our liues."
Acts,27,11,"Neuertheles the Centurion beleeued rather the gouernour and the master of the ship, then those things which were spoken of Paul."
Acts,27,12,"And because the hauen was not commodious to winter in, many tooke counsell to depart thence, if by any meanes they might attaine to Phenice, there to winter, which is an hauen of Candie, and lyeth toward the Southwest and by West, and Northwest and by West."
Acts,27,13,"And when the Southerne winde blew softly, they supposing to atteine their purpose, loosed neerer, and sailed by Candie."
Acts,27,14,"But anon after, there arose by it a stormy winde called Euroclydon."
Acts,27,15,"And when the ship was caught, and could not resist the winde, we let her goe, and were caried away."
Acts,27,16,"And we ran vnder a litle Yle named Clauda, and had much a doe to get the boat."
Acts,27,17,"Which they tooke vp and vsed all helpe, vndergirding the ship, fearing least they should haue fallen into Syrtes, and they strake saile, and so were caried."
Acts,27,18,"The next day when we were tossed with an exceeding tempest, they lightened the ship."
Acts,27,19,And the third day we cast out with our owne hands the tackling of the ship.
Acts,27,20,"And when neither sunne nor starres in many dayes appeared, and no small tempest lay vpon vs, all hope that we should be saued, was then taken away."
Acts,27,21,"But after long abstinece, Paul stood forth in the mids of them, and said, Syrs, ye should haue hearkened to me, and not haue loosed from Candie: so should ye haue gained this hurt and losse."
Acts,27,22,"But now I exhort you to be of good courage: for there shalbe no losse of any mans life among you, saue of the ship onely."
Acts,27,23,"For there stood by me this night the Angel of God, whose I am, and whome I serue,"
Acts,27,24,"Saying, Feare not, Paul: for thou must be brought before Cesar: and lo, God hath giuen vnto thee freely all that sayle with thee."
Acts,27,25,"Wherefore, sirs, be of good courage: for I beleeue God, that it shall be so as it hath bene tolde me."
Acts,27,26,"Howbeit, we must be cast into a certaine Iland."
Acts,27,27,"And when ye fourteenth night was come, as we were caried to and from in the Adriaticall sea about midnight, the shipmen deemed that some countrey approched vnto them,"
Acts,27,28,"And sounded, and found it twentie fathoms: and when they had gone a litle further, they sounded againe, and found fifteene fathoms."
Acts,27,29,"Then fearing least they should haue fallen into some rough places, they cast foure ancres out of the sterne, and wished that the day were come."
Acts,27,30,"Nowe as the mariners were about to flee out of the ship, and had let downe the boat into the sea vnder a colour as though they would haue cast ankers out of the foreship,"
Acts,27,31,"Paul sayde vnto the Centurion and the souldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye can not be safe."
Acts,27,32,"Then the souldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let it fall away."
Acts,27,33,"And when it began to be day, Paul exhorted them all to take meate, saying, This is the fourteenth day that ye haue taried, and continued fasting, receiuing nothing:"
Acts,27,34,Wherefore I exhort you to take meate: for this is for your safegarde: for there shall not an heare fall from the head of any of you.
Acts,27,35,"And when he had thus spoken, hee tooke bread and gaue thankes to God, in presence of them all, and brake it, and began to eate."
Acts,27,36,"Then were they all of good courage, and they also tooke meate."
Acts,27,37,Nowe we were in the ship in all two hundreth three score and sixteene soules.

Acts,27,39,"And when it was day, they knewe not the countrey, but they spied a certaine creeke with a banke, into the which they were minded (if it were possible) to thrust in the ship."
Acts,27,40,"So when they had taken vp the ankers, they committed the ship vnto the sea, and loosed the rudder bonds, and hoised vp the maine saile to the winde, and drewe to the shore."
Acts,27,41,"And when they fell into a place, where two seas met, they thrust in the ship: and the forepart stucke fast, and could not be moued, but the hinderpart was broken with the violence of the waues."

Acts,28,18,"Who when they had examined me, would haue let me goe, because there was no cause of death in me."
Acts,28,19,"But when the Iewes spake contrary, I was constrained to appeale vnto Cesar, not because I had ought to accuse my nation of."
