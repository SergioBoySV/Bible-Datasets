Matthew,6,25,"Therefore I say vnto you, be not carefull for your life, what ye shall eate, or what ye shall drinke: nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more worth then meate? and the bodie then raiment?"

Matthew,7,1,"Judge not, that ye be not iudged."
Matthew,7,2,"Eor with what iudgement ye iudge, ye shall be iudged, and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you againe."

Matthew,7,8,"For whosoeuer asketh, receiueth: and he, that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened."
Matthew,7,9,"For what man is there among you, which if his sonne aske him bread, woulde giue him a stone?"
Matthew,7,10,"Or if he aske fish, wil he giue him a serpent?"
Matthew,7,11,"If ye then, which are euill, can giue to your children good giftes, howe much more shall your Father which is in heauen, giue good thinges to them that aske him?"
Matthew,7,12,"Therefore whatsoeuer ye woulde that men should doe to you, euen so doe ye to them: for this is the Lawe and the Prophets."
Matthew,7,13,"Enter in at the streight gate: for it is the wide gate, and broade way that leadeth to destruction: and many there be which goe in thereat,"
Matthew,7,14,"Because the gate is streight, and the way narowe that leadeth vnto life, and fewe there be that finde it."
Matthew,7,15,"Beware of false prophets, which come to you, in sheepes clothing, but inwardly they are rauening wolues."
Matthew,7,16,Ye shall know them by their fruites. Doe men gather grapes of thornes? or figges of thistles?
Matthew,7,17,"So euery good tree bringeth foorth good fruite, and a corrupt tree bringeth forth euill fruite."
Matthew,7,18,A good tree can not bring forth euil fruite: neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruite.
Matthew,7,19,"Euery tree that bringeth not forth good fruite, is hewen downe, and cast into the fire."
Matthew,7,20,Therefore by their fruites ye shall knowe them.
Matthew,7,21,"Not euery one that sayeth vnto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdome of heauen, but he that doeth my Fathers will which is in heauen."

Matthew,7,23,"And then will I professe to them, I neuer knewe you: depart from me, ye that worke iniquitie."
Matthew,7,24,"Whosoeuer then heareth of mee these words, and doeth the same, I will liken him to a wise man, which hath builded his house on a rock:"
Matthew,7,25,"And the raine fell, and the floods came, and the windes blewe, and beat vpon that house, and it fell not: for it was grounded on a rocke."
Matthew,7,26,"But whosoeuer heareth these my wordes, and doeth them not, shall be likened vnto a foolish man, which hath builded his house vpon the sand:"
Matthew,7,27,"And the raine fell, and the floods came, and the windes blewe, and beat vpon that house, and it fell, and the fall thereof was great."
Matthew,7,28,"And it came to passe, when Iesus had ended these wordes, the people were astonied at his doctrine."
Matthew,7,29,"For he taught them as one hauing authoritie, and not as the Scribes."
Matthew,8,1,"Nowe when he was come downe from the mountaine, great multitudes followed him."
Matthew,8,2,"And loe, there came a Leper and worshipped him, saying, Master, if thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane."
Matthew,8,3,"And Iesus putting foorth his hand, touched him, saying, I will, be thou cleane: and immediatly his leprosie was clensed."
Matthew,8,4,"Then Iesus saide vnto him, See thou tell no man, but goe, and shewe thy selfe vnto the Priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a witnesse to them."

Matthew,8,16,"When the Euen was come, they brought vnto him many that were possessed with deuils: and he cast out the spirits with his worde, and healed all that were sicke,"
Matthew,8,17,"That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, saying, He tooke our infirmities, and bare our sickenesses."
Matthew,8,18,"And when Iesus sawe great multitudes of people about him, he commanded them to goe ouer the water."
Matthew,8,19,"Then came there a certaine Scribe, and said vnto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoeuer thou goest."
Matthew,8,20,"But Iesus saide vnto him, The foxes haue holes, and the birdes of the heauen haue nestes, but the Sonne of man hath not whereon to rest his head."

Matthew,11,3,"Art thou he that shoulde come, or shall we looke for another?"
Matthew,11,4,"And Iesus answering, said vnto them, Goe, and shewe Iohn, what things ye heare, and see."
Matthew,11,5,"The blinde receiue sight, and the halt doe walke: the lepers are clensed, and the deafe heare, the dead are raised vp, and the poore receiue the Gospel."
Matthew,11,6,And blessed is he that shall not be offeded in me.
Matthew,11,7,"And as they departed, Iesus beganne to speake vnto the multitude, of Iohn, What went ye out into the wildernes to see? A reede shaken with the winde?"

Matthew,11,17,"And say, We haue piped vnto you, and ye haue not daunced, we haue mourned vnto you, and ye haue not lamented."
Matthew,11,18,"For Iohn came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a deuill."
Matthew,11,19,"The sonne of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Beholde a glutton and a drinker of wine, a friend vnto Publicanes and sinners: but wisedome is iustified of her children."
Matthew,11,20,"Then began he to vpbraide the cities, wherein most of his great workes were done, because they repented not."
Matthew,11,21,"Woe be to thee, Chorazin: Woe be to thee, Bethsaida: for if ye great workes, which were done in you, had bene done in Tyrus and Sidon, they had repented long agone in sackecloth and ashes."

Matthew,12,1,"At that time Iesus went on a Sabbath day through ye corne, and his disciples were an hungred, and bega to plucke ye eares of corne and to eate."
Matthew,12,2,"And when the Pharises sawe it, they saide vnto him, Beholde, thy disciples doe that which is not lawfull to doe vpon the Sabbath."
Matthew,12,3,"But he said vnto them, Haue ye not read what Dauid did when he was an hungred, and they that were with him?"
Matthew,12,4,"Howe he entred into ye house of God, and did eate the shewe bread, which was not lawfull for him to eate, neither for them which were with him, but onely for the Priestes?"
Matthew,12,5,"Or haue ye not read in the Lawe, how that on the Sabbath dayes the Priestes in the Temple breake the Sabbath, and are blameles?"

Matthew,12,23,"And all the people were amased, and saide, Is not this that sonne of Dauid?"
Matthew,12,24,"But when the Pharises heard it, they saide, This man casteth the deuils no otherwise out, but through Beelzebub the prince of deuils."
Matthew,12,25,"But Iesus knew their thoughtes, and said to them, Euery kingdome deuided against it selfe, is brought to nought: and euery citie or house, deuided against it selfe, shall not stand."
Matthew,12,26,"So if Satan cast out Satan, he is deuided against himself: how shall then his kingdom endure?"
Matthew,12,27,"Also if I through Beelzebub cast out deuils, by whom doe your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be your iudges."
Matthew,12,28,"But if I cast out deuils by ye Spirit of God, then is the kingdome of God come vnto you."
Matthew,12,29,"Els howe can a man enter into a strong mans house and spoyle his goods, except he first bind the strong man, and then spoile his house."

Matthew,12,35,"A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth foorth good things: and an euill man out of an euill treasure, bringeth forth euill things."

Matthew,12,38,"Then answered certaine of ye Scribes and of the Pharises, saying, Master, we would see a signe of thee."
Matthew,12,39,"But he answered and said to them, An euill and adulterous generation seeketh a signe, but no signe shall be giuen vnto it, saue that signe of the Prophet Ionas."

Matthew,12,45,"Then he goeth, and taketh vnto him seuen other spirites worse then himselfe, and they enter in, and dwell there: and the ende of that man is worse then the beginning. Euen so shall it be with this wicked generation."
Matthew,12,46,"While he yet spake to ye multitude, beholde, his mother, and his brethren stood without, desiring to speake with him."
Matthew,12,47,"Then one said vnto him, Beholde, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speake with thee."
Matthew,12,48,"But he answered, and said to him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?"
Matthew,12,49,"And he stretched foorth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Beholde my mother and my brethren."

Matthew,13,6,"And when the sunne was vp, they were parched, and for lacke of rooting, withered away."
Matthew,13,7,"And some fell among thornes, and the thornes sprong vp, and choked them."
Matthew,13,8,"Some againe fel in good ground, and brought forth fruite, one corne an hundreth folde, some sixtie folde, and another thirtie folde."
Matthew,13,9,"He that hath eares to heare, let him heare."
Matthew,13,10,"Then the disciples came, and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?"
Matthew,13,11,"And he answered, and said vnto them, Because it is giuen vnto you, to know the secretes of the kingdome of heauen, but to the it is not giue."
Matthew,13,12,"For whosoeuer hath, to him shalbe giuen, and he shall haue abundance: but whosoeuer hath not, from him shalbe taken away, euen that he hath."
Matthew,13,13,"Therefore speake I to them in parables, because they seeing, doe not see: and hearing, they heare not, neither vnderstand."
Matthew,13,14,"So in them is fulfilled the prophecie of Esaias, which prophecie saieth, By hearing, ye shall heare, and shall not vnderstand, and seeing, ye shall see, and shall not perceiue."
Matthew,13,15,"For this peoples heart is waxed fat, and their eares are dull of hearing, and with their eyes they haue winked, lest they should see with their eyes, and heare with their eares, and should vnderstand with their hearts, and should returne, that I might heale them."
Matthew,13,16,"But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your eares, for they heare."
Matthew,13,17,"For verely I say vnto you, that many Prophets, and righteous men haue desired to see those things which ye see, and haue not seene them, and to heare those things which ye heare, and haue not heard them."
Matthew,13,18,Heare ye therefore ye parable of ye sower.
Matthew,13,19,"Whensoeuer any man heareth the woorde of that kingdome, and vnderstandeth it not, that euil one commeth, and catcheth away that which was sowen in his heart: and this is he which hath receiued the seede by the way side."
Matthew,13,20,"And hee that receiued seede in the stonie grounde, is he which heareth the woorde, and incontinently with ioy receiueth it,"
Matthew,13,21,"Yet hath he no roote in himselfe, and dureth but a season: for assoone as tribulation or persecution commeth because of the woorde, by and by he is offended."
Matthew,13,22,"And hee that receiued the seede among thornes, is hee that heareth the woorde: but the care of this worlde, and the deceitfulnesse of riches choke the word, and he is made vnfruitfull."
Matthew,13,23,"But he that receiued the seede in the good ground, is he that heareth the worde, and vnderstandeth it, which also beareth fruite, and bringeth foorth, some an hundreth folde, some sixtie folde, and some thirtie folde."
Matthew,13,24,"Another parable put hee foorth vnto them, saying, The kingdome of heauen is like vnto a man which sowed good seede in his fielde."
Matthew,13,25,"But while men slept, there came his enemie, and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his waie."
Matthew,13,26,"And when the blade was sprong vp, and brought forth fruite, then appeared the tares also."
Matthew,13,27,"Then came the seruaunts of the housholder, and sayd vnto him, Master, sowedst not thou good seede in thy fielde? from whence then hath it tares?"
Matthew,13,28,"And hee said to them, Some enuious man hath done this. Then the seruants saide vnto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them vp?"
Matthew,13,29,"But he saide, Nay, lest while yee goe about to gather the tares, yee plucke vp also with them the wheat."
Matthew,13,30,"Let both growe together vntill the haruest, and in time of haruest I will say to the reapers, Gather yee first the tares, and binde them in sheaues to burne them: but gather the wheate into my barne."
Matthew,13,31,"Another parable he put foorth vnto them, saying, The kingdome of heauen is like vnto a graine of mustard seede, which a man taketh and soweth in his fielde:"
Matthew,13,32,"Which in deede is the least of all seedes: but when it is growen, it is the greatest among herbes, and it is a tree, so that the birdes of heauen come and builde in the branches thereof."
Matthew,13,33,"Another parable spake hee to them, The kingdome of heauen is like vnto leauen, which a woman taketh and hideth in three pecks of meale, till all be leauened."
Matthew,13,34,"All these thinges spake Iesus vnto the multitude in parables, and without parables spake he not to them,"
Matthew,13,35,"That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables, and will vtter the thinges which haue beene kept secrete from the foundation of the worlde."
Matthew,13,36,"Then sent Iesus the multitude away, and went into the house. And his disciples came vnto him, saying, Declare vnto vs the parable of the tares of that fielde."
Matthew,13,37,"Then answered he, and saide to them, He that soweth the good seede, is the Sonne of man."
Matthew,13,38,"And the field is the worlde, and the good seede are the children of the kingdome, and the tares are the children of that wicked one."
Matthew,13,39,"And the enemie that soweth them, is the deuill, and the haruest is the end of the worlde, and the reapers be the Angels."
Matthew,13,40,"As then the tares are gathered and burned in ye fire, so shall it be in the end of this world."
Matthew,13,41,"The Sonne of man shall send forth his Angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which doe iniquitie,"
Matthew,13,42,And shall cast them into a fornace of fire. There shalbe wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew,13,43,"Then shall the iust men shine as ye sunne in the kingdome of their Father. Hee that hath eares to heare, let him heare."
Matthew,13,44,"Againe, the kingdom of heauen is like vnto a treasure hid in ye field, which when a man hath found, he hideth it, and for ioy thereof departeth and selleth all that he hath, and buieth that field."
Matthew,13,45,"Againe, the kingdome of heauen is like to a marchant man, that seeketh good pearles,"
Matthew,13,46,"Who hauing found a pearle of great price, went and solde all that he had, and bought it."
Matthew,13,47,"Againe, the kingdom of heauen is like vnto a drawe net cast into the sea, that gathereth of all kindes of things."
Matthew,13,48,"Which, when it is full, men draw to lande, and sit and gather the good into vessels, and cast the bad away."
Matthew,13,49,"So shall it be at the end of the world. The Angels shall goe foorth, and seuer the bad from among the iust,"
Matthew,13,50,"And shall cast them into a fornace of fire: there shalbe wailing, and gnashing of teeth."
Matthew,13,51,"Iesus saide vnto them, Vnderstand yee all these things? They saide vnto him, Yea, Lord."
Matthew,13,52,"Then sayd hee vnto them, Therefore euery Scribe which is taught vnto the kingdome of heauen, is like vnto an householder, which bringeth foorth out of his treasure things both newe and olde."
Matthew,13,53,"And it came to passe, that when Iesus had ended these parables, he departed thence,"
Matthew,13,54,"And came into his owne countrey, and taught them in their Synagogue, so that they were astonied, and saide, Whence commeth this wisdome and great woorkes vnto this man?"
Matthew,13,55,"Is not this the carpenters sonne? Is not his mother called Marie, and his brethren Iames and Ioses, and Simon and Iudas?"
Matthew,13,56,And are not his sisters all with vs? Whence then hath he all these things?
Matthew,13,57,"And they were offended with him. Then Iesus said to them, A Prophet is not without honour, saue in his owne countrey, and in his owne house."
Matthew,13,58,"And he did not many great woorkes there, for their vnbeliefes sake."
Matthew,14,1,"At that time Herod the Tetrarche heard of the fame of Iesus,"
Matthew,14,2,"And sayde vnto his seruaunts, This is that Iohn Baptist, hee is risen againe from the deade, and therefore great woorkes are wrought by him."
Matthew,14,3,"For Herod had taken Iohn, and bounde him, and put him in prison for Herodias sake, his brother Philips wife."
Matthew,14,4,"For Iohn saide vnto him, It is not lawfull for thee to haue her."
Matthew,14,5,"And when hee woulde haue put him to death, hee feared the multitude, because they counted him as a Prophet."
Matthew,14,6,"But when Herods birth day was kept, the daughter of Herodias daunced before them, and pleased Herod."
Matthew,14,7,"Wherefore he promised with an othe, that he would giue her whatsoeuer she would aske."
Matthew,14,8,"And shee being before instructed of her mother, sayde, Giue mee here Iohn Baptists head in a platter."
Matthew,14,9,"And the King was sorie: neuerthelesse because of the othe, and them that sate with him at the table, he commanded it to be giuen her,"
Matthew,14,10,"And sent, and beheaded Iohn in the prison."
Matthew,14,11,"And his head was brought in a platter, and giuen to the maide, and shee brought it vnto her mother."
Matthew,14,12,"And his disciples came, and tooke vp the bodie, and buried it, and went, and tolde Iesus."
Matthew,14,13,"And when Iesus heard it, hee departed thence by shippe into a desert place apart. And when the multitude had heard it, they followed him on foote out of the cities."
Matthew,14,14,"And Iesus went foorth and sawe a great multitude, and was mooued with compassion toward them, and he healed their sicke."
Matthew,14,15,"And when euen was come, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desart place, and the time is alreadie past: let the multitude depart, that they may goe into the townes, and bye them vitailes."
Matthew,14,16,"But Iesus saide to them, They haue no neede to goe away: giue yee them to eate."
Matthew,14,17,"Then saide they vnto him, Wee haue here but fiue loaues, and two fishes."
Matthew,14,18,"And he saide, Bring them hither to me."
Matthew,14,19,"And hee commanded the multitude to sit downe on the grasse, and tooke the fiue loaues and the two fishes, and looked vp to heauen and blessed, and brake, and gaue the loaues to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude."
Matthew,14,20,"And they did all eate, and were sufficed, and they tooke vp of the fragments that remained, twelue baskets full."
Matthew,14,21,"And they that had eaten, were about fiue thousande men, beside women and litle children."
Matthew,14,22,"And straightway Iesus compelled his disciples to enter into a shippe, and to goe ouer before him, while he sent the multitude away."
Matthew,14,23,"And assoone as hee had sent the multitude away, he went vp into a moutaine alone to pray: and when the euening was come, hee was there alone."
Matthew,14,24,"And the shippe was nowe in the middes of the sea, and was tossed with waues: for it was a contrarie winde."
Matthew,14,25,"And in the fourth watch of the night, Iesus went vnto them, walking on the sea."
Matthew,14,26,"And when his disciples sawe him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit, and cried out for feare."
Matthew,14,27,"But straight way Iesus spake vnto them, saying, Be of good comfort, It is I: be not afraide."
Matthew,14,28,"Then Peter answered him, and saide, Master, if it be thou, bid me come vnto thee on the water."
Matthew,14,29,"And he saide, Come. And when Peter was come downe out of the shippe, he walked on the water, to goe to Iesus."
Matthew,14,30,"But when he sawe a mightie winde, he was afraide: and as he began to sinke, he cried, saying, Master, saue me."
Matthew,14,31,"So immediatly Iesus stretched foorth his hande, and caught him, and saide to him, O thou of litle faith, wherefore diddest thou doubt?"
Matthew,14,32,"And assoone as they were come into the ship, the winde ceased."
Matthew,14,33,"Then they that were in the ship, came and worshipped him, saying, Of a trueth thou art the Sonne of God."
Matthew,14,34,"And when they were come ouer, they came into the land of Gennezaret."
Matthew,14,35,"And when the men of that place knewe him, they sent out into all that countrey rounde about, and brought vnto him all that were sicke,"
Matthew,14,36,"And besought him, that they might touch the hemme of his garment onely: and as many as touched it, were made whole."
Matthew,15,1,"Then came to Iesus the Scribes and Pharises, which were of Hierusalem, saying,"
Matthew,15,2,Why do thy disciples transgresse the tradition of the Elders? for they wash not their hands when they eate bread.
Matthew,15,3,"But he answered and said vnto them, Why doe yee also transgresse the commandement of God by your tradition?"
Matthew,15,4,"For God hath commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and he that curseth father or mother, let him die the death."
Matthew,15,5,"But ye say, Whosoeuer shall say to father or mother, By the gift that is offered by me, thou maiest haue profite,"
Matthew,15,6,"Though hee honour not his father, or his mother, shalbe free: thus haue ye made the commandement of God of no aucthoritie by your tradition."
Matthew,15,7,"O hypocrites, Esaias prophecied well of you, saying,"
Matthew,15,8,"This people draweth neere vnto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with the lips, but their heart is farre off from me."
Matthew,15,9,"But in vaine they worship me, teaching for doctrines, mens precepts."
Matthew,15,10,"Then hee called the multitude vnto him, and said to them, Heare and vnderstand."
Matthew,15,11,"That which goeth into the mouth, defileth not the man, but that which commeth out of the mouth, that defileth the man."
Matthew,15,12,"Then came his disciples, and saide vnto him, Perceiuest thou not, that the Pharises are offended in hearing this saying?"
Matthew,15,13,"But hee answered and saide, Euery plant which mine heauenly Father hath not planted, shalbe rooted vp."
Matthew,15,14,"Let them alone, they be the blinde leaders of the blinde: and if the blinde leade ye blinde, both shall fall into the ditche."
Matthew,15,15,"Then answered Peter, and said to him, Declare vnto vs this parable."
Matthew,15,16,"Then said Iesus, Are ye yet without vnderstanding?"
Matthew,15,17,"Perceiue ye not yet, that whatsoeuer entreth into the mouth, goeth into the bellie, and is cast out into the draught?"
Matthew,15,18,"But those thinges which proceede out of the mouth, come from the heart, and they defile the man."
Matthew,15,19,"For out of the heart come euil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, slaunders."
Matthew,15,20,"These are the things, which defile the man: but to eat with vnwashen hands, defileth not ye man."
Matthew,15,21,"And Iesus went thence, and departed into the coastes of Tyrus and Sidon."
Matthew,15,22,"And beholde, a woman a Cananite came out of the same coasts, and cried, saying vnto him, Haue mercie on me, O Lord, the sonne of Dauid: my daughter is miserably vexed with a deuil."
Matthew,15,23,"But hee answered her not a worde. Then came to him his disciples, and besought him, saying, Sende her away, for she crieth after vs."
Matthew,15,24,"But he answered, and said, I am not sent, but vnto the lost sheepe of the house of Israel."
Matthew,15,25,"Yet she came, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, helpe me."
Matthew,15,26,"And he answered, and said, It is not good to take the childrens bread, and to cast it to whelps."
Matthew,15,27,"But she said, Trueth, Lord: yet in deede the whelpes eate of the crommes, which fall from their masters table."
Matthew,15,28,"Then Iesus answered, and saide vnto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it to thee, as thou desirest. And her daughter was made whole at that houre."
Matthew,15,29,"So Iesus went away from thence, and came neere vnto the sea of Galile, and went vp into a mountaine and sate downe there."
Matthew,15,30,"And great multitudes came vnto him, hauing with them, halt, blinde, dumme, maymed, and many other, and cast them downe at Iesus feete, and he healed them."
Matthew,15,31,"In so much that the multitude wondered, to see the dumme speake, the maimed whole, the halt to goe, and the blinde to see: and they glorified the God of Israel."
Matthew,15,32,"Then Iesus called his disciples vnto him, and said, I haue compassion on this multitude, because they haue continued with mee already three dayes, and haue nothing to eate: and I wil not let them depart fasting, least they faint in the way."
Matthew,15,33,"And his disciples saide vnto him, Whence should we get so much bread in the wildernes, as should suffice so great a multitude!"
Matthew,15,34,"And Iesus said vnto them, How many loaues haue ye? And they said, Seuen, and a few litle fishes."
Matthew,15,35,"Then he commanded the multitude to sit downe on the ground,"
Matthew,15,36,"And tooke the seuen loaues, and the fishes, and gaue thankes, and brake them, and gaue to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude."
Matthew,15,37,"And they did all eate, and were sufficed: and they tooke vp of the fragments that remained, seuen baskets full."
Matthew,15,38,"And they that had eaten, were foure thousand men, beside women, and litle children."
Matthew,15,39,"Then Iesus sent away the multitude, and tooke ship, and came into the partes of Magdala."
Matthew,16,1,"Then came the Pharises and Sadduces, and did tempt him, desiring him to shew them a signe from heauen."
Matthew,16,2,"But he answered, and said vnto them, When it is euening, ye say, Faire wether: for ye skie is red."
Matthew,16,3,"And in the morning ye say, To day shall be a tempest: for the skie is red and lowring. O hypocrites, ye can discerne the face of the skie, and can ye not discerne the signes of the times?"
Matthew,16,4,"The wicked generation, and adulterous seeketh a signe, but there shall no signe be giuen it, but that signe of the Prophet Ionas: so hee left them, and departed."
Matthew,16,5,"And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread with them."
Matthew,16,6,"Then Iesus said vnto them, Take heede and beware of the leauen of the Pharises and Sadduces."
Matthew,16,7,"And they reasoned among themselues, saying, It is because we haue brought no bread."
Matthew,16,8,"But Iesus knowing it, saide vnto them, O ye of litle faith, why reason you thus among your selues, because ye haue brought no bread?"
Matthew,16,9,"Doe ye not yet perceiue, neither remember the fiue loaues, when there were fiue thousand men, and how many baskets tooke ye vp?"
Matthew,16,10,"Neither the seuen loaues when there were foure thousande men, and howe many baskets tooke ye vp?"
Matthew,16,11,"Why perceiue ye not that I said not vnto you concerning bread, that ye shoulde beware of the leauen of the Pharises and Sadduces?"
Matthew,16,12,"Then vnderstood they that he had not said that they should beware of the leauen of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharises, and Sadduces."
Matthew,16,13,"Nowe when Iesus came into the coastes of Cesarea Philippi, hee asked his disciples, saying, Whome doe men say that I, the sonne of man am?"
Matthew,16,14,"And they said, Some say, Iohn Baptist: and some, Elias: and others, Ieremias, or one of the Prophets."
Matthew,16,15,"He said vnto them, But whome say ye that I am?"
Matthew,16,16,"Then Simon Peter answered, and said, Thou art that Christ, the Sonne of the liuing God."
Matthew,16,17,"And Iesus answered, and saide to him, Blessed art thou, Simon, the sonne of Ionas: for flesh and blood hath not reueiled it vnto thee, but my Father which is in heauen."
Matthew,16,18,"And I say also vnto thee, that thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke I will builde my Church: and ye gates of hell shall not ouercome it."
Matthew,16,19,"And I will giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and whatsoeuer thou shalt binde vpon earth, shalbe bound in heauen: and whatsoeuer thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heauen."
Matthew,16,20,"Then hee charged his disciples, that they should tell no man that he was Iesus that Christ."
Matthew,16,21,"From that time foorth Iesus beganne to shewe vnto his disciples, that he must goe vnto Hierusalem, and suffer many thinges of the Elders, and of the hie Priestes, and Scribes, and be slaine, and be raised againe the thirde day."
Matthew,16,22,"Then Peter tooke him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying, Master, pitie thy selfe: this shall not be vnto thee."
Matthew,16,23,"Then he turned backe, and said vnto Peter, Get thee behinde me, Satan: thou art an offence vnto me, because thou vnderstandest not the thinges that are of God, but the thinges that are of men."
Matthew,16,24,"Iesus then saide to his disciples, If any man will follow me, let him forsake himselfe: and take vp his crosse, and follow me."
Matthew,16,25,"For whosoeuer will saue his life, shall lose it: and whosoeuer shall lose his life for my sake, shall finde it."
Matthew,16,26,"For what shall it profite a man though he should winne the whole worlde, if hee lose his owne soule? or what shall a man giue for recompence of his soule?"
Matthew,16,27,"For the Sonne of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his Angels, and then shall he giue to euery man according to his deedes."
Matthew,16,28,"Verely I say vnto you, there bee some of them that stande here, which shall not taste of death, till they haue seene the Sonne of man come in his kingdome."
Matthew,17,1,"And after sixe dayes, Iesus tooke Peter, and Iames and Iohn his brother, and brought them vp into an hie mountaine apart,"
Matthew,17,2,"And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the Sunne, and his clothes were as white as the light."
Matthew,17,3,"And beholde, there appeared vnto them Moses, and Elias, talking with him."
Matthew,17,4,"Then answered Peter, and saide to Iesus, Master, it is good for vs to be here: if thou wilt, let vs make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias."
Matthew,17,5,"While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloude shadowed them: and beholde, there came a voyce out of the cloude, saying, This is that my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleased: heare him."
Matthew,17,6,"And when the disciples heard that, they fell on their faces, and were sore afraide."
Matthew,17,7,"Then Iesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraide."
Matthew,17,8,"And when they lifted vp their eyes, they sawe no man, saue Iesus onely."
Matthew,17,9,"And as they came downe from the moutaine, Iesus charged them, saying, Shewe the vision to no man, vntil the Sonne of man rise againe from the dead."
Matthew,17,10,"And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the Scribes that Elias must first come?"
Matthew,17,11,"And Iesus answered, and saide vnto them, Certeinely Elias must first come, and restore all thinges."
Matthew,17,12,"But I say vnto you that Elias is come alreadie, and they knewe him not, but haue done vnto him whatsoeuer they would: likewise shall also the Sonne of man suffer of them."
Matthew,17,13,Then the disciples perceiued that he spake vnto them of Iohn Baptist.
Matthew,17,14,"And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certaine man, and fell downe at his feete,"
Matthew,17,15,"And saide, Master, haue pitie on my sonne: for he is lunatike, and is sore vexed: for oft times he falleth into the fire, and oft times into the water."
Matthew,17,16,"And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not heale him."
Matthew,17,17,"Then Iesus answered, and said, O generation faithlesse, and crooked, how long now shall I be with you! howe long nowe shall I suffer you! bring him hither to me."
Matthew,17,18,"And Iesus rebuked the deuill, and he went out of him: and the childe was healed at that houre."
Matthew,17,19,"Then came the disciples to Iesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?"
Matthew,17,20,"And Iesus said vnto them, Because of your vnbeliefe: for verely I say vnto you, if ye haue faith as much as is a graine of mustarde seede, ye shall say vnto this mountaine, Remooue hence to yonder place, and it shall remoue: and nothing shalbe vnpossible vnto you."
Matthew,17,21,"Howbeit this kinde goeth not out, but by prayer and fasting."
Matthew,17,22,"And they being in Galile, Iesus said vnto them, The Sonne of man shall be deliuered into the handes of men,"
Matthew,17,23,"And they shall kill him, but the thirde day shall he rise againe: and they were very sorie."
Matthew,17,24,"And when they were come to Capernaum, they that receiued polle money, came to Peter, and sayd, Doeth not your Master pay polle money?"
Matthew,17,25,"He sayd, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Iesus preuented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whome doe the Kings of the earth take tribute, or polle money? of their children, or of strangers?"
Matthew,17,26,"Peter sayd vnto him, Of strangers. Then said Iesus vnto him, Then are the children free."
Matthew,17,27,"Neuerthelesse, lest we should offend them: goe to the sea, and cast in an angle, and take the first fish that commeth vp, and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt finde a piece of twentie pence: that take, and giue it vnto them for me and thee."
Matthew,18,1,"The same time the disciples came vnto Iesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdome of heauen?"
Matthew,18,2,"And Iesus called a litle childe vnto him, and set him in the mids of them,"
Matthew,18,3,"And sayd, Verely I say vnto you, except ye be conuerted, and become as litle children, ye shall not enter into the kingdome of heauen."
Matthew,18,4,"Whosoeuer therefore shall humble himselfe as this litle childe, the same is the greatest in the kingdome of heauen."
Matthew,18,5,"And whosoeuer shall receiue one such litle childe in my name, receiueth me."
Matthew,18,6,"But whosoeuer shall offend one of these litle ones which beleeue in me, it were better for him, that a milstone were hanged about his necke, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea."
Matthew,18,7,"Wo be vnto the world because of offences: for it must needes be that offences shall come, but wo be to that man by whome the offence commeth."
Matthew,18,8,"Wherefore, if thy hand or thy foote cause thee to offend, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life, halt, or maimed, then hauing two hands, or two feete, to be cast into euerlasting fire."
Matthew,18,9,"And if thine eye cause thee to offende, plucke it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, then hauing two eyes to be cast into hell fire."
Matthew,18,10,"See that ye despise not one of these litle ones: for I say vnto you, that in heauen their Angels alwayes behold the face of my Father which is in heauen."
Matthew,18,11,For the Sonne of man is come to saue that which was lost.
Matthew,18,12,"How thinke ye? If a man haue an hundreth sheepe, and one of them be gone astray, doeth he not leaue ninetie and nine, and go into the mountaines, and seeke that which is gone astray?"
Matthew,18,13,"And if so be that he finde it, verely I say vnto you, he reioyceth more of that sheepe, then of the ninetie and nine which went not astray:"
Matthew,18,14,"So is it not ye wil of your Father which is in heauen, that one of these litle ones should perish."
Matthew,18,15,"Moreouer, if thy brother trespasse against thee, goe and tell him his fault betweene thee and him alone: if he heare thee, thou hast wonne thy brother."
Matthew,18,16,"But if he heare thee not, take yet with thee one or two, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses euery worde may be confirmed."
Matthew,18,17,"And if he refuse to heare them, tell it vnto the Church: and if he refuse to heare the Church also, let him be vnto thee as an heathen man, and a Publicane."
Matthew,18,18,"Verely I say vnto you, Whatsoeuer ye bind on earth, shall be bound in heauen: and whatsoeuer ye loose on earth, shalbe loosed in heauen."
Matthew,18,19,"Againe, verely I say vnto you, that if two of you shall agree in earth vpon any thing, whatsoeuer they shall desire, it shall be giuen them of my Father which is in heauen."
Matthew,18,20,"For where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the mids of them."
Matthew,18,21,"Then came Peter to him, and said, Master, howe oft shall my brother sinne against me, and I shall forgiue him? vnto seuen times?"
Matthew,18,22,"Iesus said vnto him, I say not to thee, Vnto seuen times, but, Vnto seuentie times seuen times."
Matthew,18,23,"Therefore is the kingdome of heauen likened vnto a certaine King, which would take an account of his seruants."
Matthew,18,24,"And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought vnto him, which ought him ten thousand talents."
Matthew,18,25,"And because he had nothing to pay, his Lord commanded him to be solde, and his wife, and his children, and all that he had, and the dette to be payed."
Matthew,18,26,"The seruant therefore fell downe, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, refraine thine anger toward me, and I will pay thee all."
Matthew,18,27,"Then that seruants Lord had compassion, and loosed him, and forgaue him the dette."
Matthew,18,28,"But when the seruant was departed, hee found one of his felow seruants, which ought him an hundred pence, and he layde hands on him, and thratled him, saying, Pay me that thou owest."
Matthew,18,29,"Then his fellow seruant fell downe at his feete, and besought him, saying, Refraine thine anger towards me, and I will pay thee all."
Matthew,18,30,"Yet he would not, but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the dette."
Matthew,18,31,"And when his other felowe seruants sawe what was done, they were very sory, and came, and declared vnto their Lord all that was done."
Matthew,18,32,"Then his Lord called him vnto him, and sayd to him, O euil seruant, I forgaue thee all that dette, because thou prayedst me."
Matthew,18,33,"Oughtest not thou also to haue had pitie on thy fellowe seruant, euen as I had pitie on thee?"
Matthew,18,34,"So his Lord was wroth, and deliuered him to the tormentours, till he should pay all that was due to him."
Matthew,18,35,"So likewise shall mine heauenly Father doe vnto you, except ye forgiue from your hearts, eche one to his brother their trespasses."
Matthew,19,1,"And it came to passe, that when Iesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galile, and came into ye coasts of Iudea beyond Iordan."
Matthew,19,2,"And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there."
Matthew,19,3,"Then came vnto him the Pharises tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawfull for a man to put away his wife vpon euery occasion?"
Matthew,19,4,"And he answered and sayd vnto them, Haue ye not read, that hee which made them at the beginning, made them male and female,"
Matthew,19,5,"And sayd, For this cause, shall a man leaue father and mother, and cleaue vnto his wife, and they which were two shalbe one flesh."
Matthew,19,6,"Wherefore they are no more twaine, but one flesh. Let not man therefore put asunder that, which God hath coupled together."
Matthew,19,7,"They said to him, Why did then Moses commaund to giue a bill of diuorcement, and to put her away?"
Matthew,19,8,"He sayd vnto them, Moses, because of the hardnesse of your heart, suffered you to put away your wiues: but from the beginning it was not so."
Matthew,19,9,"I say therefore vnto you, that whosoeuer shall put away his wife, except it be for whoredome, and marry another, committeth adulterie: and whosoeuer marieth her which is diuorced, doeth commit adulterie."
Matthew,19,10,"Then sayd his disciples to him, If the matter be so betweene man and wife, it is not good to marry."
Matthew,19,11,"But he sayd vnto them, All men cannot receiue this thing, saue they to whom it is giuen."
Matthew,19,12,"For there are some eunuches, which were so borne of their mothers belly: and there be some eunuches, which be gelded by men: and there be some eunuches, which haue gelded them selues for the kingdome of heauen. He that is able to receiue this, let him receiue it."
Matthew,19,13,"Then were brought to him litle children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them."
Matthew,19,14,"But Iesus sayd, Suffer the litle children, and forbid them not to come to me: for of such is the kingdome of heauen."
Matthew,19,15,"And when he had put his hands on them, he departed thence."
Matthew,19,16,"And beholde, one came and sayd vnto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I doe, that I may haue eternall life?"
Matthew,19,17,"And he said vnto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, eue God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keepe ye commandemets."
Matthew,19,18,"He sayd to him, Which? And Iesus sayde, These, Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not commit adulterie: Thou shalt not steale: Thou shalt not beare false witnesse."
Matthew,19,19,Honour thy father and mother: and thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.
Matthew,19,20,"The yong man sayd vnto him, I haue obserued all these things from my youth: what lacke I yet?"
Matthew,19,21,"Iesus sayd vnto him, If thou wilt be perfite, go, sell that thou hast, and giue it to the poore, and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen, and come, and follow me."
Matthew,19,22,"And when the yong man heard that saying, he went away sorowfull: for he had great possessions."
Matthew,19,23,"Then Iesus sayd vnto his disciples, Verely I say vnto you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdome of heauen."
Matthew,19,24,"And againe I say vnto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into ye kingdome of God."
Matthew,19,25,"And whe his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amased, saying, Who then can be saued?"
Matthew,19,26,"And Iesus behelde them, and sayde vnto them, With men this is vnpossible, but with God all things are possible."
Matthew,19,27,"Then answered Peter, and said to him, Beholde, we haue forsaken all, and followed thee: what therefore shall we haue?"
Matthew,19,28,"And Iesus said vnto them, Verely I say to you, that when the Sonne of man shall sit in the throne of his maiestie, ye which folowed me in the regeneration, shall sit also vpon twelue thrones and iudge the twelue tribes of Israel."
Matthew,19,29,"And whosoeuer shall forsake houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my Names sake, he shall receiue an hundreth folde more, and shall inherite euerlasting life."
Matthew,19,30,"But many that are first, shalbe last, and the last shalbe first."
Matthew,20,1,"For the kingdome of heauen is like vnto a certaine, housholder, which went out at the dawning of the day to hire labourers into his vineyarde."
Matthew,20,2,"And he agreed with the labourers for a peny a day, and sent them into his vineyard."
Matthew,20,3,"And he went out about the third houre, and sawe other standing idle in the market place,"
Matthew,20,4,"And sayd vnto them, Goe ye also into my vineyard, and whatsoeuer is right, I will giue you: and they went their way."
Matthew,20,5,"Againe he went out about the sixt and ninth houre, and did likewise."
Matthew,20,6,"And he went about the eleuenth houre, and found other standing idle, and sayd vnto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?"
Matthew,20,7,"They sayd vnto him, Because no man hath hired vs. He sayd to them, Goe ye also into my vineyard, and whatsoeuer is right, that shall ye receiue."
Matthew,20,8,"And when euen was come, the master of the vineyard sayd vnto his steward, Call the labourers, and giue them their hire, beginning at the last, till thou come to the first."
Matthew,20,9,"And they which were hired about ye eleuenth houre, came and receiued euery man a penie."
Matthew,20,10,"Nowe when the first came, they supposed that they should receiue more, but they likewise receiued euery man a penie."
Matthew,20,11,"And when they had receiued it, they murmured against the master of the house,"
Matthew,20,12,"Saying, These last haue wrought but one houre, and thou hast made them equall vnto vs, which haue borne the burden and heate of the day."
Matthew,20,13,"And hee answered one of them, saying, Friend, I doe thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penie?"
Matthew,20,14,"Take that which is thine owne, and go thy way: I will giue vnto this last, as much as to thee."
Matthew,20,15,"Is it not lawfull for me to do as I will with mine owne? Is thine eye euil, because I am good?"
Matthew,20,16,"So the last shalbe first, and the first last: for many are called, but fewe chosen."
Matthew,20,17,"And Iesus went vp to Hierusalem, and tooke the twelue disciples apart in the way, and said vnto them,"
Matthew,20,18,"Beholde, wee goe vp to Hierusalem, and the Sonne of man shall bee deliuered vnto the chiefe priestes, and vnto the Scribes, and they shall condemne him to death,"
Matthew,20,19,"And shall deliuer him to the Gentiles, to mocke, and to scourge, and to crucifie him, but the third day he shall rise againe."
Matthew,20,20,"Then came to him the mother of Zebedeus children with her sonnes, worshipping him, and desiring a certaine thing of him."
Matthew,20,21,"And he said vnto her, What wouldest thou? She said to him, Graunt that these my two sonnes may sit, the one at thy right hand, and the other at thy left hand in thy kingdome."
Matthew,20,22,"And Iesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye aske. Are ye able to drinke of the cup that I shall drinke of, and to be baptized with the baptisme that I shalbe baptized with? They said to him, We are able."
Matthew,20,23,"And he said vnto them, Ye shall drinke in deede of my cup, and shall be baptized with the baptisme, that I am baptized with, but to sit at my right hande, and at my left hand, is not mine to giue: but it shalbe giuen to them for whome it is prepared of my Father."
Matthew,20,24,"And when the other ten heard this, they disdained at the two brethren."
Matthew,20,25,"Therefore Iesus called them vnto him, and saide, We knowe that the lordes of the Gentiles haue domination ouer them, and they that are great, exercise authoritie ouer them."
Matthew,20,26,"But it shall not be so among you: but whosoeuer will be great among you, let him be your seruant."
Matthew,20,27,"And whosoeuer will be chiefe among you, let him be your seruant."
Matthew,20,28,"Euen as the Sonne of man came not to be serued, but to serue, and to giue his life for the ransome of many."
Matthew,20,29,"And as they departed from Iericho, a great multitude followed him."
Matthew,20,30,"And beholde, two blinde men, sitting by the way side, when they heard that Iesus passed by, cryed, saying, O Lord, the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on vs."
Matthew,20,31,"And the multitude rebuked them, because they should holde their peace: but they cried the more, saying, O Lord, the Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on vs."
Matthew,20,32,"Then Iesus stoode still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I should do to you?"
Matthew,20,33,"They saide to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened."
Matthew,20,34,"And Iesus mooued with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediatly their eyes receiued sight, and they followed him."
Matthew,21,1,"And when they drewe neere to Hierusalem, and were come to Bethphage, vnto the mount of the Oliues, then sent Iesus two disciples,"
Matthew,21,2,"Saying to them, Goe into the towne that is ouer against you, and anon yee shall finde an asse bounde, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them vnto me."
Matthew,21,3,"And if any man say ought vnto you, say ye, that the Lord hath neede of them, and straightway he will let them goe."
Matthew,21,4,"All this was done that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Prophet, saying,"
Matthew,21,5,"Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Beholde, thy King commeth vnto thee, meeke and sitting vpon an asse, and a colte, the foale of an asse vsed to the yoke."
Matthew,21,6,"So the disciples went, and did as Iesus had commanded them,"
Matthew,21,7,"And brought the asse and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and set him thereon."
Matthew,21,8,"And a great multitude spred their garments in the way: and other cut downe branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way."
Matthew,21,9,"Moreouer, the people that went before, and they also that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Sonne of Dauid, Blessed be hee that commeth in the Name of the Lord, Hosanna thou which art in the highest heauens."
Matthew,21,10,"And when he was come into Hierusalem, all the citie was mooued, saying, Who is this?"
Matthew,21,11,"And the people said, This is Iesus that Prophet of Nazareth in Galile."
Matthew,21,12,"And Iesus went into the Temple of God, and cast out all them that solde and bought in the Temple, and ouerthrew the tables of the money chagers, and the seates of them that sold doues,"
Matthew,21,13,"And said to them, it is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer: but ye haue made it a denne of theeues."
Matthew,21,14,"Then the blinde, and the halt came to him in the Temple, and he healed them."
Matthew,21,15,"But when the chiefe priestes and Scribes sawe the marueiles that hee did, and the children crying in the Temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Sonne of Dauid, they disdained,"
Matthew,21,16,"And said vnto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Iesus said vnto them, Yea: read ye neuer, By the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast made perfite the praise?"
Matthew,21,17,"So hee left them, and went out of the citie vnto Bethania, and lodged there."
Matthew,21,18,"And in the morning, as he returned into the citie, he was hungrie,"
Matthew,21,19,"And seeing a figge tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaues onely, and said to it, Neuer fruite grow on thee henceforwards. And anon the figge tree withered."
Matthew,21,20,"And when his disciples saw it, they marueiled, saying, How soone is the figge tree withered!"
Matthew,21,21,"And Iesus answered and said vnto them, Verely I say vnto you, if ye haue faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only doe that, which I haue done to the figge tree, but also if ye say vnto this mountaine, Take thy selfe away, and cast thy selfe into the sea, it shalbe done."
Matthew,21,22,"And whatsoeuer ye shall aske in prayer, if ye beleeue, ye shall receiue it."
Matthew,21,23,"And whe he was come into the Temple, the chiefe Priestes, and the Elders of the people came vnto him, as he was teaching, and saide, By what authoritie doest thou these things? and who gaue thee this authoritie?"
Matthew,21,24,"Then Iesus answered and said vnto them, I also will aske of you a certaine thing, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authoritie I doe these things."
Matthew,21,25,"The baptisme of Iohn, whence was it? from heauen, or of men? Then they reasoned among themselues, saying, If we shall say, From heauen, he will say vnto vs, Why did ye not then beleeue him?"
Matthew,21,26,"And if we say, Of men, we feare the multitude, for all holde Iohn as a Prophet."
Matthew,21,27,"Then they answered Iesus, and said, We can not tell. And he said vnto them, Neither tell I you by what authoritie I doe these things."
Matthew,21,28,"But what thinke ye? A certaine man had two sonnes, and came to the elder, and saide, Sonne, goe and worke to day in my vineyarde."
Matthew,21,29,"But he answered, and said, I will not: yet afterward he repented himselfe, and went."
Matthew,21,30,"Then came he to the second, and said likewise. And he answered, and said, I will, Syr: yet he went not."
Matthew,21,31,"Whether of them twaine did the will of the father? They saide vnto him, The first. Iesus saide vnto them, Verely I say vnto you, that the Publicanes and the harlots goe before you into the kingdome of God."
Matthew,21,32,"For Iohn came vnto you in the way of righteousnes, and yee beleeued him not: but the Publicanes, and the harlots beleeued him, and ye, though ye sawe it, were not mooued with repentance afterward, that ye might beleeue him."
Matthew,21,33,"Heare another parable, There was a certaine housholder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and made a winepresse therein, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a strange countrey."
Matthew,21,34,"And when the time of the fruite drewe neere, hee sent his seruants to the husbandmen to receiue the fruites thereof."
Matthew,21,35,"And ye husbandmen tooke his seruants and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another."
Matthew,21,36,"Againe hee sent other seruants, moe then the first: and they did the like vnto them."
Matthew,21,37,"But last of all he sent vnto them his owne sonne, saying, They will reuerence my sonne."
Matthew,21,38,"But when the husbandmen saw the sonne, they saide among themselues, This is the heire: come, let vs kill him, and let vs take his inheritance."
Matthew,21,39,"So they tooke him, and cast him out of the vineyarde, and slewe him."
Matthew,21,40,"When therefore the Lord of the vineyarde shall come, what will hee doe to those husbandmen?"
Matthew,21,41,"They saide vnto him, Hee will cruelly destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard vnto other husbandmen, which shall deliuer him the fruites in their seasons."
Matthew,21,42,"Iesus saide vnto them, Read ye neuer in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders refused, the same is made the head of the corner? This was the Lordes doing, and it is marueilous in our eyes."
Matthew,21,43,"Therefore say I vnto you, The kingdome of God shalbe taken from you, and shalbe giuen to a nation, which shall bring foorth the fruites thereof."
Matthew,21,44,"And whosoeuer shall fall on this stone, he shalbe broken: but on whomsoeuer it shall fall, it will dash him a pieces."
Matthew,21,45,"And when the chiefe Priestes and Pharises had heard his parables, they perceiued that hee spake of them."
Matthew,21,46,"And they seeking to laye handes on him, feared the people, because they tooke him as a Prophet."
Matthew,22,1,"Then Iesus answered, and spake vnto them againe in parables, saying,"
Matthew,22,2,"The kingdome of heauen is like vnto a certaine King which maried his sonne,"
Matthew,22,3,"And sent foorth his seruants, to call them that were bidde to the wedding, but they woulde not come."
Matthew,22,4,"Againe hee sent foorth other seruants, saying. Tell them which are bidden, Beholde, I haue prepared my dinner: mine oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all thinges are readie: come vnto the mariage."
Matthew,22,5,"But they made light of it, and went their wayes, one to his farme, and another about his marchandise."
Matthew,22,6,"And the remnant tooke his seruants, and intreated them sharpely, and slewe them."
Matthew,22,7,"But when the King heard it, he was wroth, and sent foorth his warriers, and destroyed those murtherers, and burnt vp their citie."
Matthew,22,8,"Then saide hee to his seruants, Truely the wedding is prepared: but they which were bidden, were not worthy."
Matthew,22,9,"Go ye therefore out into the high wayes, and as many as ye finde, bid them to the mariage."
Matthew,22,10,"So those seruantes went out into the hie wayes, and gathered together all that euer they found, both good and bad: so the wedding was furnished with ghestes."
Matthew,22,11,"Then the King came in, to see the ghestes, and sawe there a man which had not on a wedding garment."
Matthew,22,12,"And he sayd vnto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither, and hast not on a wedding garment? And he was speachlesse."
Matthew,22,13,"Then sayd the King to the seruants, Binde him hand and foote: take him away, and cast him into vtter darkenes: there shalbe weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Matthew,22,14,"For many are called, but fewe chosen."
Matthew,22,15,Then went the Pharises and tooke counsell how they might tangle him in talke.
Matthew,22,16,"And they sent vnto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we knowe that thou art true, and teachest the way of God truely, neither carest for any man: for thou considerest not the person of men."
Matthew,22,17,"Tell vs therefore, how thinkest thou? Is it lawfull to giue tribute vnto Cesar, or not?"
Matthew,22,18,"But Iesus perceiued their wickednes, and sayd, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?"
Matthew,22,19,Shewe me the tribute money. And they brought him a peny.
Matthew,22,20,"And he sayde vnto them, Whose is this image and superscription?"
Matthew,22,21,"They sayd vnto him, Cesars. Then sayd he vnto them, Giue therefore to Cesar, the things which are Cesars, and giue vnto God, those things which are Gods."
Matthew,22,22,"And when they heard it, they marueiled, and left him, and went their way."
Matthew,22,23,"The same day the Sadduces came to him (which say that there is no resurrection) and asked him,"
Matthew,22,24,"Saying, Master, Moses sayd, If a man die, hauing no children, his brother shall marie his wife by the right of alliance, and raise vp seede vnto his brother."
Matthew,22,25,"Nowe there were with vs seuen brethren, and the first maried a wife, and deceased: and hauing none yssue, left his wife vnto his brother."
Matthew,22,26,"Likewise also the second, and the third, vnto the seuenth."
Matthew,22,27,And last of all the woman died also.
Matthew,22,28,"Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seuen? for all had her."
Matthew,22,29,"Then Iesus answered, and sayd vnto them, Ye are deceiued, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God."
Matthew,22,30,"For in the resurrection they neither marie wiues, nor wiues are bestowed in mariage, but are as the Angels of God in heauen."
Matthew,22,31,"And concerning the resurrection of the dead, haue ye not read what is spoken vuto you of God, saying,"
Matthew,22,32,"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing."
Matthew,22,33,"And when the multitude heard it, they were astonied at his doctrine."
Matthew,22,34,"But when the Pharises had heard, that he had put the Sadduces to silence, they assembled together."
Matthew,22,35,"And one of them, which was an expounder of the Lawe, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,"
Matthew,22,36,"Master, which is ye great commandement in the Lawe?"
Matthew,22,37,"Iesus sayd to him, Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soule, and with all thy minde."
Matthew,22,38,This is the first and the great commandement.
Matthew,22,39,"And the second is like vnto this, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe."
Matthew,22,40,"On these two commandements hangeth the whole Lawe, and the Prophets."
Matthew,22,41,"While the Pharises were gathered together, Iesus asked them,"
Matthew,22,42,"Saying, What thinke ye of Christ? whose sonne is he? They sayd vnto him, Dauids."
Matthew,22,43,"He sayd vnto them, How then doeth Dauid in spirit call him Lord, saying,"
Matthew,22,44,"The Lord sayd to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footestoole?"
Matthew,22,45,"If then Dauid call him Lord, howe is he his sonne?"
Matthew,22,46,"And none could answere him a worde, neither durst any from that day foorth aske him any moe questions."
Matthew,23,1,"Then spake Iesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,"
Matthew,23,2,"Saying, The Scribes and the Pharises sit in Moses seate."
Matthew,23,3,"All therefore whatsoeuer they bid you obserue, that obserue and doe: but after their workes doe not: for they say, and doe not."
Matthew,23,4,"For they binde heauie burdens, and grieuous to be borne, and lay them on mens shoulders, but they themselues will not moue them with one of their fingers."
Matthew,23,5,"All their workes they doe for to be seene of men: for they make their phylacteries broad, and make long the frindges of their garments,"
Matthew,23,6,"And loue the chiefe place at feastes, and to haue the chiefe seates in the assemblies,"
Matthew,23,7,"And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi."
Matthew,23,8,"But be not ye called, Rabbi: for one is your doctour, to wit, Christ, and all ye are brethren."
Matthew,23,9,"And call no man your father vpon the earth: for there is but one, your father which is in heauen."
Matthew,23,10,"Be not called doctours: for one is your doctour, euen Christ."
Matthew,23,11,"But he that is greatest among you, let him be your seruant."
Matthew,23,12,"For whosoeuer will exalt himselfe, shall be brought lowe: and whosoeuer will humble himselfe, shalbe exalted."
Matthew,23,13,"Wo therefore be vnto you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites, because ye shut vp the kingdome of heauen before men: for ye your selues go not in, neither suffer ye them that would enter, to come in."
Matthew,23,14,"Wo be vnto you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye deuoure widowes houses, euen vnder a colour of long prayers: wherefore ye shall receiue the greater damnation."
Matthew,23,15,"Wo be vnto you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye compasse sea and land to make one of your profession: and when he is made, ye make him two folde more the childe of hell, then you your selues."
Matthew,23,16,"Wo be vnto you blinde guides, which say, Whosoeuer sweareth by the Temple, it is nothing: but whosoeuer sweareth by the golde of the Temple, he offendeth."
Matthew,23,17,"Ye fooles and blinde, whether is greater, the golde, or the Temple that sanctifieth the golde?"
Matthew,23,18,"And whosoeuer sweareth by the altar, it is nothing: but whosoeuer sweareth by the offering that is vpon it, offendeth."
Matthew,23,19,"Ye fooles and blinde, whether is greater, the offering, or the altar which sanctifieth the offering?"
Matthew,23,20,"Whosoeuer therefore sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon."
Matthew,23,21,"And whosoeuer sweareth by the Temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein."
Matthew,23,22,"And he that sweareth by heauen, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon."
Matthew,23,23,"Wo be to you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye tithe mynt, and annyse, and cummyn, and leaue the weightier matters of the law, as iudgement, and mercy and fidelitie. These ought ye to haue done, and not to haue left the other."
Matthew,23,24,"Ye blinde guides, which straine out a gnat, and swallowe a camell."
Matthew,23,25,"Wo be to you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye make cleane the vtter side of the cup, and of the platter: but within they are ful of briberie and excesse."
Matthew,23,26,"Thou blinde Pharise, cleanse first the inside of the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be cleane also."
Matthew,23,27,"Wo be to you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye are like vnto whited tombes, which appeare beautifull outward, but are within full of dead mens bones, and all filthines."
Matthew,23,28,"So are ye also: for outwarde ye appeare righteous vnto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisie and iniquitie."
Matthew,23,29,"Wo be vnto you, Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites: for ye build the tombes of the Prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,"
Matthew,23,30,"And say, If we had bene in the dayes of our fathers, we would not haue bene partners with them in the blood of the Prophets."
Matthew,23,31,"So then ye be witnesses vnto your selues, that ye are the children of them that murthered the Prophets."

Matthew,26,8,"And when his disciples sawe it, they had indignation, saying, What needed this waste?"
Matthew,26,9,"For this oyntment might haue bene solde for much, and bene giuen to the poore."
Matthew,26,10,"And Iesus knowing it, sayde vnto them, Why trouble yee the woman? for shee hath wrought a good woorke vpon me."
Matthew,26,11,"For yee haue the poore alwayes with you, but me shall yee not haue alwaies."

Matthew,26,15,"And said, What will ye giue me, and I will deliuer him vnto you? and they appoynted vnto him thirtie pieces of siluer."
Matthew,26,16,"And from that time, he sought opportunitie to betraie him."
Matthew,26,17,"Nowe on the first day of the feast of vnleauened bread the disciples came to Iesus, saying vnto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eate the Passeouer?"
Matthew,26,18,"And he said, Goe yee into the citie to such a man, and say to him, The master saieth, My time is at hande: I will keepe the Passeouer at thine house with my disciples."
Matthew,26,19,"And the disciples did as Iesus had giuen them charge, and made readie the Passeouer."
Matthew,26,20,"So when the Euen was come, hee sate downe with the twelue."
Matthew,26,21,"And as they did eate, he sayde, Verely I say vnto you, that one of you shall betraie me."

Matthew,26,23,"And hee answered and sayde, Hee that dippeth his hande with me in the dish, hee shall betraie me."
Matthew,26,24,"Surely the Sonne of man goeth his way, as it is written of him: but woe be to that man, by whom the Sonne of man is betrayed: it had bene good for that man, if hee had neuer bene borne."
Matthew,26,25,"Then Iudas which betraied him, answered and sayde, Is it I, Master? He sayde vnto him, Thou hast sayd it."

Matthew,26,32,"But after I am risen againe, I will go before you into Galile."
Matthew,26,33,"But Peter aunswered, and sayde vnto him, Though that al men should be offended by thee, yet will I neuer be offended."

Matthew,26,35,"Peter saide vnto him, Though I should die with thee, I will in no case denie thee. Likewise also sayd all the disciples."
Matthew,26,36,"Then went Iesus with them into a place which is called Gethsemane, and said vnto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I goe, and pray yonder."
Matthew,26,37,"And hee tooke vnto him Peter, and the two sonnes of Zebedeus, and began to waxe sorowfull, and grieuously troubled."
Matthew,26,38,"Then sayde Iesus vnto them, My soule is very heauie, euen vnto the death: tarie yee here, and watch with me."
Matthew,26,39,"So hee went a litle further, and fell on his face, and praied, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup passe from me: neuerthelesse, not as I will, but as thou wilt."
Matthew,26,40,"After, hee came vnto the disciples, and founde them a sleepe, and sayde to Peter, What? coulde yee not watch with me one houre?"
Matthew,26,41,"Watch, and praie, that yee enter not into tentation: the spirit in deede is readie, but the flesh is weake."
Matthew,26,42,"Againe he went away the second time, and praied, saying, O my Father, if this cuppe can not passe away from mee, but that I must drinke it, thy will be done."
Matthew,26,43,"And he came, and founde them a sleepe againe, for their eyes were heauie."
Matthew,26,44,"So he left them and went away againe, and praied the third time, saying the same woordes."
Matthew,26,45,"Then came he to his disciples, and said vnto them, Sleepe henceforth, and take your rest: behold, the houre is at hand, and the Sonne of man is giuen into the hands of sinners."
Matthew,26,46,"Rise, let vs goe: beholde, hee is at hande that betraieth me."
Matthew,26,47,"And while hee yet spake, loe Iudas, one of the twelue, came, and with him a great multitude with swordes and staues, from the high Priests and Elders of the people."
Matthew,26,48,"Now he that betraied him, had giuen them a token, saying, Whomesoeuer I shall kisse, that is he, laie holde on him."
Matthew,26,49,"And forthwith he came to Iesus, and sayd, God saue thee, Master, and kissed him."
Matthew,26,50,"Then Iesus sayde vnto him, Friende, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laide hands on Iesus, and tooke him."
Matthew,26,51,"And behold, one of them which were with Iesus, stretched out his hand, and drewe his sworde, and strooke a seruaunt of the high Priest, and smote off his eare."
Matthew,26,52,"Then sayde Iesus vnto him, Put vp thy sworde into his place: for all that take the sworde, shall perish with the sworde."
Matthew,26,53,"Either thinkest thou, that I can not now pray to my Father, and he will giue me moe then twelue legions of Angels?"
Matthew,26,54,"Howe then shoulde the Scriptures bee fulfilled, which say, that it must be so?"
Matthew,26,55,"The same houre sayde Iesus to the multitude, Ye be come out as it were against a thiefe, with swordes and staues to take mee: I sate daily teaching in the Temple among you, and yee tooke me not."
Matthew,26,56,"But all this was done, that the Scriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsooke him, and fled."
Matthew,26,57,"And they tooke Iesus, and led him to Caiaphas the hie Priest, where the Scribes and the Elders were assembled."
Matthew,26,58,"And Peter followed him a farre off vnto the hie Priestes hall, and went in, and sate with the seruants to see the ende."
Matthew,26,59,"Nowe the chiefe Priestes and the Elders, and all the whole councill sought false witnesse against Iesus, to put him to death."
Matthew,26,60,"But they founde none, and though many false witnesses came, yet founde they none: but at the last came two false witnesses,"
Matthew,26,61,"And saide, This man saide, I can destroie the Temple of God, and build it in three daies."
Matthew,26,62,"Then the chiefe Priest arose, and sayde to him, Answerest thou nothing? What is the matter that these men witnesse against thee?"
Matthew,26,63,"But Iesus helde his peace. Then the chiefe Priest answered, and saide to him, I charge thee sweare vnto vs by the liuing God, to tell vs, If thou be that Christ the Sonne of God, or no."
Matthew,26,64,"Iesus saide to him, Thou hast saide it: neuerthelesse I say vnto you, hereafter shall ye see the Sonne of man, sitting at the right hande of the power of God, and come in the cloudes of the heauen."
Matthew,26,65,"Then the hie Priest rent his clothes, saying, Hee hath blasphemed, what haue wee any more neede of witnesses? beholde: nowe yee haue heard his blasphemie."
Matthew,26,66,"What thinke yee? They answered, and said, He is guiltie of death."
Matthew,26,67,"Then spet they in his face, and buffeted him, and other smote him with roddes,"
Matthew,26,68,"Saying, Prophecie to vs, O Christ, Who is he that smote thee?"
Matthew,26,69,"Peter sate without in the hall, and a maide came to him, saying, Thou also wast with Iesus of Galile:"
Matthew,26,70,"But hee denied before them all, saying, I wote not what thou saiest."
Matthew,26,71,"And when hee went out into the porche, another maide sawe him, and sayde vnto them that were there, This man was also with Iesus of Nazareth."
Matthew,26,72,"And againe he denied with an othe, saying, I knowe not the man."
Matthew,26,73,"So after a while, came vnto him they that stoode by, and sayde vnto Peter, Surely thou art also one of them: for euen thy speache bewraieth thee."
Matthew,26,74,"Then began hee to curse himselfe, and to sweare, saying, I knowe not the man. And immediately the cocke crewe."
Matthew,26,75,"Then Peter remembred the wordes of Iesus, which had sayde vnto him, Before the cocke crowe thou shalt denie me thrise. So he went out, and wept bitterly."
Matthew,27,1,"When the morning was come, all the chiefe Priests, and the elders of the people tooke counsell against Iesus, to put him to death,"
Matthew,27,2,"And led him away bounde, and deliuered him vnto Pontius Pilate the gouernour."
Matthew,27,3,"Then when Iudas which betraied him, sawe that hee was condemned, hee repented himselfe, and brought againe the thirtie pieces of siluer to the chiefe Priestes, and Elders,"
Matthew,27,4,"Saying, I haue sinned, betraying the innocent bloud. But they sayde, What is that to vs? see thou to it."
Matthew,27,5,"And when hee had cast downe the siluer pieces in the Temple, hee departed, and went, and hanged himselfe."
Matthew,27,6,"And the chiefe Priestes tooke the siluer pieces, and sayde, It is not lawfull for vs to put them into the treasure, because it is the price of bloud."
Matthew,27,7,"And they tooke counsell, and bought with them a potters fielde, for the buriall of strangers."
Matthew,27,8,"Wherefore that field is called, The field of bloud, vntill this day."
Matthew,27,9,"(Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Ieremias the Prophet, saying, And they tooke thirtie siluer pieces, ye price of him that was valued, whom they of ye children of Israel valued."
Matthew,27,10,"And they gaue them for the potters fielde, as the Lord appointed me.)"
Matthew,27,11,"And Iesus stood before ye gouernour, and the gouernour asked him, saying, Art thou that King of the Iewes? Iesus said vnto him, Thou sayest it."
Matthew,27,12,"And when he was accused of the chiefe Priestes, and Elders, he answered nothing."
Matthew,27,13,"Then saide Pilate vnto him, Hearest thou not howe many things they lay against thee?"
Matthew,27,14,"But he answered him not to one worde, in so much that the gouernour marueiled greatly."
Matthew,27,15,"Nowe at the feast, the gouernour was wont to deliuer vnto the people a prisoner whom they would."
Matthew,27,16,"And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas."
Matthew,27,17,"When they were then gathered together, Pilate said vnto the, Whether will ye that I let loose vnto you Barabbas, or Iesus which is called Christ?"
Matthew,27,18,"(For he knewe well, that for enuie they had deliuered him."
Matthew,27,19,"Also when he was set downe vpon the iudgement seate, his wife sent to him, saying, Haue thou nothing to do with that iust man: for I haue suffered many things this day in a dreame by reason of him.)"
Matthew,27,20,"But the chiefe Priestes and the Elders had persuaded the people that they shoulde aske Barabbas, and should destroy Iesus."
Matthew,27,21,"Then the gouernour answered, and said vnto them, Whether of the twaine will ye that I let loose vnto you? And they said, Barabbas."
Matthew,27,22,"Pilate said vnto them, What shall I do then with Iesus, which is called Christ? They all said to him, Let him be crucified."
Matthew,27,23,"Then saide the gouernour, But what euill hath he done? Then they cryed the more, saying, Let him be crucified."
Matthew,27,24,"When Pilate saw that he auailed nothing, but that more tumult was made, he tooke water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this iust man: looke you to it."
Matthew,27,25,"Then answered all the people, and saide, His bloud be on vs, and on our children."
Matthew,27,26,"Thus let he Barabbas loose vnto them, and scourged Iesus, and deliuered him to be crucified."
Matthew,27,27,"Then the souldiers of the gouernour tooke Iesus into the common hall, and gathered about him the whole band,"
