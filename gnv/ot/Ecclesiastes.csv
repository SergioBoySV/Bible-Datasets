Ecclesiastes,1,7,"All the riuers goe into the sea, yet the sea is not full: for the riuers goe vnto ye place, whence they returne, and goe."
Ecclesiastes,1,8,"All things are full of labour: man cannot vtter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the eare filled with hearing."
Ecclesiastes,1,9,What is it that hath bene? that that shalbe: and what is it that hath bene done? that which shalbe done: and there is no newe thing vnder the sunne.
Ecclesiastes,1,10,"Is there any thing, whereof one may say, Beholde this, it is newe? it hath bene already in the olde time that was before vs."
Ecclesiastes,1,11,"There is no memorie of the former, neither shall there be a remembrance of the latter that shalbe, with them that shall come after."
Ecclesiastes,1,12,I the Preacher haue bene King ouer Israel in Ierusalem:
Ecclesiastes,1,13,"And I haue giuen mine heart to search and finde out wisdome by all things that are done vnder the heauen: (this sore trauaile hath GOD giuen to the sonnes of men, to humble them thereby)"
Ecclesiastes,1,14,"I haue considered all the workes that are done vnder the sunne, and beholde, all is vanitie, and vexation of the spirit."
Ecclesiastes,1,15,"That which is crooked, can none make straight: and that which faileth, cannot be nombred."
Ecclesiastes,1,16,"I thought in mine heart, and said, Behold, I am become great, and excell in wisdome all them that haue bene before me in Ierusalem: and mine heart hath seene much wisedome and knowledge."
Ecclesiastes,1,17,"And I gaue mine heart to knowe wisdome and knowledge, madnes and foolishnes: I knew also that this is a vexation of the spirit."
Ecclesiastes,1,18,"For in the multitude of wisedome is much griefe: and he that increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorowe."
Ecclesiastes,2,1,"I said in mine heart, Goe to nowe, I will proue thee with ioy: therefore take thou pleasure in pleasant things: and beholde, this also is vanitie."
Ecclesiastes,2,2,"I saide of laughter, Thou art mad: and of ioy, What is this that thou doest?"
Ecclesiastes,2,3,"I sought in mine heart to giue my selfe to wine, and to leade mine heart in wisdome, and to take holde of follie, till I might see where is that goodnesse of the children of men, which they enioy vnder the sunne: the whole nomber of the dayes of their life."
Ecclesiastes,2,4,I haue made my great workes: I haue built me houses: I haue planted me vineyards.
Ecclesiastes,2,5,"I haue made me gardens and orchards, and planted in them trees of all fruite."
Ecclesiastes,2,6,"I haue made me cisternes of water, to water therewith the woods that growe with trees."

Ecclesiastes,2,8,"I haue gathered vnto me also siluer and gold, and the chiefe treasures of Kings and prouinces: I haue prouided me men singers and women singers, and the delites of the sonnes of men, as a woman taken captiue, and women taken captiues."
Ecclesiastes,2,9,"And I was great, and increased aboue all that were before me in Ierusalem: also my wisedome remained with me."
Ecclesiastes,2,10,"And whatsoeuer mine eyes desired, I withheld it not from them: I withdrew not mine heart from any ioy: for mine heart reioyced in al my labour: and this was my portion of all my trauaile."
Ecclesiastes,2,11,"Then I looked on all my workes that mine hands had wrought, and on the trauaile that I had laboured to doe: and beholde, all is vanitie and vexation of the spirit: and there is no profite vnder the sunne."
Ecclesiastes,2,12,"And I turned to beholde wisedome, and madnes and follie: (for who is the man that will come after the King in things, which men nowe haue done?)"
Ecclesiastes,2,13,"Then I saw that there is profite in wisdome, more then in follie: as the light is more excellent then darkenes."
Ecclesiastes,2,14,"For the wise mans eyes are in his head, but the foole walketh in darknes: yet I know also that the same condition falleth to them all."
Ecclesiastes,2,15,"Then I thought in mine heart, It befalleth vnto me, as it befalleth to ye foole. Why therefore doe I then labour to be more wise? And I sayd in mine heart, that this also is vanitie."
Ecclesiastes,2,16,"For there shalbe no remembrance of the wise, nor of the foole for euer: for that that now is, in the dayes to come shall all be forgotten. And howe dyeth the wise man, as doeth the foole?"
Ecclesiastes,2,17,"Therefore I hated life: for the worke that is wrought vnder the sunne is grieuous vnto me: for all is vanitie, and vexation of the spirit."
Ecclesiastes,2,18,"I hated also all my labour, wherein I had trauailed vnder the sunne, which I shall leaue to the man that shalbe after me."
Ecclesiastes,2,19,"And who knoweth whether he shalbe wise or foolish? yet shall hee haue rule ouer all my labour, wherein I haue trauailed, and wherein I haue shewed my selfe wise vnder the sunne. This is also vanitie."
Ecclesiastes,2,20,"Therefore I went about to make mine heart abhorre all the labour, wherein I had trauailed vnder the sunne."
Ecclesiastes,2,21,"For there is a man whose trauaile is in wisdome, and in knowledge and in equitie: yet to a man that hath not trauailed herein, shall he giue his portion: this also is vanitie and a great griefe."
Ecclesiastes,2,22,"For what hath man of all his trauaile and griefe of his heart, wherein he hath trauailed vnder the sunne?"
Ecclesiastes,2,23,"For all his dayes are sorowes, and his trauaile griefe: his heart also taketh not rest in the night: which also is vanitie."
Ecclesiastes,2,24,"There is no profit to man: but that he eate, and drinke, and delight his soule with the profit of his labour: I saw also this, that it was of the hand of God."
Ecclesiastes,2,25,"For who could eate, and who could haste to outward things more then I?"
Ecclesiastes,2,26,"Surely to a man that is good in his sight, God giueth wisdome, and knowledge, and ioy: but to the sinner he giueth paine, to gather, and to heape to giue to him that is good before God: this is also vanitie, and vexation of the spirit."
Ecclesiastes,3,1,"To all things there is an appointed time, and a time to euery purpose vnder the heauen."
Ecclesiastes,3,2,"A time to bee borne, and a time to die: a time to plant, and a time to plucke vp that which is planted."
Ecclesiastes,3,3,"A time to slay, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, and a time to builde."
Ecclesiastes,3,4,"A time to weepe, and a time to laugh: a time to mourne, and a time to dance."

Ecclesiastes,3,6,"A time to seeke, and a time to lose: a time to keepe, and a time to cast away."
Ecclesiastes,3,7,"A time to rent, and a time to sowe: a time to keepe silence, and a time to speake."
Ecclesiastes,3,8,"A time to loue, and a time to hate: a time of warre, and a time of peace."

Ecclesiastes,3,15,"What is that that hath bene? that is nowe: and that that shalbe, hath now bene: for God requireth that which is past."
Ecclesiastes,3,16,"And moreouer I haue seene vnder the sunne the place of iudgement, where was wickednesse, and the place of iustice where was iniquitie."
Ecclesiastes,3,17,"I thought in mine heart, God wil iudge the iust and the wicked: for time is there for euery purpose and for euery worke."
Ecclesiastes,3,18,"I considered in mine heart the state of the children of men that God had purged them: yet to see to, they are in themselues as beastes."
Ecclesiastes,3,19,"For the condition of the children of men, and the condition of beasts are euen as one condition vnto them. As the one dyeth, so dyeth the other: for they haue all one breath, and there is no excellency of man aboue ye beast: for all is vanitie."
Ecclesiastes,3,20,"All goe to one place, and all was of the dust, and all shall returne to the dust."
Ecclesiastes,3,21,"Who knoweth whether the spirit of man ascend vpward, and the spirit of the beast descend downeward to the earth?"
Ecclesiastes,3,22,"Therefore I see that there is nothing better then that a man shoulde reioyce in his affaires, because that is his portion. For who shall bring him to see what shalbe after him?"
Ecclesiastes,4,1,"So I turned and considered all the oppressions that are wrought vnder the sunne, and beholde the teares of the oppressed, and none comforteth them: and lo, the strength is of the hand of them that oppresse them, and none comforteth them."
Ecclesiastes,4,2,"Wherefore I praysed the dead which now are dead, aboue the liuing, which are yet aliue."

Ecclesiastes,4,9,Two are better then one: for they haue better wages for their labour.
Ecclesiastes,4,10,"For if they fal, the one wil lift vp his felow: but wo vnto him that is alone: for he falleth, and there is not a second to lift him vp."
Ecclesiastes,4,11,"Also if two sleepe together, then shall they haue heate: but to one how should there be heate?"
Ecclesiastes,4,12,"And if one ouercome him, two shall stand against him: and a threefolde coard is not easily broken."
Ecclesiastes,4,13,"Better is a poore and wise childe, then an olde and foolish King, which will no more be admonished."
Ecclesiastes,4,14,"For out of the prison he commeth forth to reigne: when as he that is borne in his kingdome, is made poore."

Ecclesiastes,5,1,"Be not rash with thy mouth, nor let thine heart be hastie to vtter a thing before God: for God is in the heauens, and thou art on the earth: therefore let thy wordes be fewe."
Ecclesiastes,5,2,For as a dreame commeth by the multitude of businesse: so the voyce of a foole is in the multitude of wordes.
Ecclesiastes,5,3,"When thou hast vowed a vowe to God, deferre not to pay it: for he deliteth not in fooles: pay therefore that thou hast vowed."
Ecclesiastes,5,4,"It is better that thou shouldest not vowe, then that thou shouldest vow and not pay it."
Ecclesiastes,5,5,"Suffer not thy mouth to make thy flesh to sinne: neither say before the Angel, that this is ignorance: wherefore shall God bee angry by thy voyce, and destroy the worke of thine hands?"
Ecclesiastes,5,6,"For in the multitude of dreames, and vanities are also many wordes: but feare thou God."
Ecclesiastes,5,7,"If in a countrey thou seest the oppression of the poore, and the defrauding of iudgement and iustice, be not astonied at the matter: for hee that is higher then the highest, regardeth, and there be higher then they."
Ecclesiastes,5,8,And the abundance of the earth is ouer all: the King also consisteth by the fielde that is tilled.
Ecclesiastes,5,9,"He that loueth siluer, shall not be satisfied with siluer, and he that loueth riches, shalbe without the fruite thereof: this also is vanitie."
Ecclesiastes,5,10,"When goods increase, they are increased that eate them: and what good commeth to the owners thereof, but the beholding thereof with their eyes?"
Ecclesiastes,5,11,"The sleepe of him that traueileth, is sweete, whether he eate litle or much: but the sacietie of the riche will not suffer him to sleepe."
Ecclesiastes,5,12,"There is an euill sickenes that I haue seene vnder the sunne: to wit, riches reserued to the owners thereof for their euill."
Ecclesiastes,5,13,"And these riches perish by euill trauel, and he begetteth a sonne, and in his hand is nothing."
Ecclesiastes,5,14,"As hee came foorth of his mothers belly, he shall returne naked to goe as he came, and shall beare away nothing of his labour, which hee hath caused to passe by his hand."
Ecclesiastes,5,15,"And this also is an euill sickenes that in all pointes as he came, so shall he goe, and what profit hath he that he hath traueiled for the winde?"
Ecclesiastes,5,16,"Also all his dayes hee eateth in darkenes with much griefe, and in his sorowe and anger."
Ecclesiastes,5,17,"Beholde then, what I haue seene good, that it is comely to eate, and to drinke, and to take pleasure in all his labour, wherein he traueileth vnder the sunne, the whole nomber of the dayes of his life, which God giueth him: for this is his portion."
Ecclesiastes,5,18,"Also to euery man to whom God hath giuen riches and treasures, and giueth him power to eate thereof, and to take his part, and to enioy his labour: this is the gift of God."
Ecclesiastes,5,19,"Surely hee will not much remember the dayes of his life, because God answereth to the ioy of his heart."
Ecclesiastes,6,1,"There is an euill, which I sawe vnder the sunne, and it is much among men:"
Ecclesiastes,6,2,"A man to whom God hath giuen riches and treasures and honour, and he wanteth nothing for his soule of all that it desireth: but God giueth him not power to eate thereof, but a strange man shall eate it vp: this is vanitie, and this is an euill sicknesse."
Ecclesiastes,6,3,"If a man beget an hundreth children and liue many yeeres, and the dayes of his yeeres be multiplied, and his soule be not satisfied with good things, and he be not buried, I say that an vntimely fruite is better then he."
Ecclesiastes,6,4,For he commeth into vanitie and goeth into darkenesse: and his name shall be couered with darkenesse.
Ecclesiastes,6,5,"Also he hath not seene ye sunne, nor knowen it: therefore this hath more rest then the other."
Ecclesiastes,6,6,"And if he had liued a thousand yeeres twise tolde, and had seene no good, shall not all goe to one place?"
Ecclesiastes,6,7,All the labour of man is for his mouth: yet the soule is not filled.
Ecclesiastes,6,8,For what hath the wise man more then the foole? what hath the poore that knoweth how to walke before the liuing?
Ecclesiastes,6,9,"The sight of ye eye is better then to walke in ye lustes: this also is vanitie, and vexation of spirit."

Ecclesiastes,7,1,Surely there be many things that increase vanitie: and what auaileth it man?
Ecclesiastes,7,2,"For who knoweth what is good for man in the life and in the nomber of the dayes of the life of his vanitie, seeing he maketh them as a shadowe? For who can shewe vnto man what shall be after him vnder the sunne?"
Ecclesiastes,7,3,"A good name is better then a good oyntment, and the day of death, then the day that one is borne."
Ecclesiastes,7,4,"It is better to goe to the house of mourning, then to goe to the house of feasting, because this is the ende of all men: and the liuing shall lay it to his heart."

Ecclesiastes,7,7,"Better it is to heare ye rebuke of a wise man, then that a man should heare the song of fooles."
Ecclesiastes,7,8,"For like ye noyse of the thornes vnder the pot, so is the laughter of the foole: this also is vanitie."

Ecclesiastes,7,10,"The ende of a thing is better then the beginning thereof, and the pacient in spirit is better then the proude in spirit."

Ecclesiastes,7,15,Beholde the worke of God: for who can make straight that which he hath made crooked?

Ecclesiastes,7,18,"Be not thou iust ouermuch, neither make thy selfe ouerwise: wherefore shouldest thou be desolate?"
Ecclesiastes,7,19,"Be not thou wicked ouermuch, neither be thou foolish: wherefore shouldest thou perish not in thy time?"
Ecclesiastes,7,20,"It is good that thou lay hold on this: but yet withdrawe not thine hand from that: for he that feareth God, shall come forth of them all."
Ecclesiastes,7,21,Wisedome shall strengthen the wise man more then ten mightie princes that are in ye citie.
Ecclesiastes,7,22,"Surely there is no man iust in the earth, that doeth good and sinneth not."
Ecclesiastes,7,23,"Giue not thine heart also to all ye wordes that men speake, lest thou doe heare thy seruant cursing thee."
Ecclesiastes,7,24,For often times also thine heart knoweth that thou likewise hast cursed others.
Ecclesiastes,7,25,"All this haue I prooued by wisedome: I thought I will be wise, but it went farre from me."
Ecclesiastes,7,26,"It is farre off, what may it be? and it is a profound deepenesse, who can finde it?"
Ecclesiastes,7,27,"I haue compassed about, both I and mine heart to knowe and to enquire and to search wisedome, and reason, and to knowe the wickednesse of follie, and the foolishnesse of madnesse,"
Ecclesiastes,7,28,"And I finde more bitter then death the woman whose heart is as nettes and snares, and her handes, as bands: he that is good before God, shalbe deliuered from her, but the sinner shall be taken by her."
Ecclesiastes,7,29,"Beholde, sayth the Preacher, this haue I found, seeking one by one to finde the count:"
Ecclesiastes,7,30,"And yet my soule seeketh, but I finde it not: I haue found one man of a thousand: but a woman among them all haue I not founde."
Ecclesiastes,7,31,"Onely loe, this haue I founde, that God hath made man righteous: but they haue sought many inuentions."
Ecclesiastes,8,1,Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? the wisedome of a man doth make his face to shine: and the strength of his face shalbe changed.
Ecclesiastes,8,2,"I aduertise thee to take heede to ye mouth of the King, and to the worde of the othe of God."

Ecclesiastes,8,5,"He that keepeth the commandement, shall knowe none euill thing, and the heart of the wise shall knowe the time and iudgement."
Ecclesiastes,8,6,"For to euery purpose there is a time and iudgement, because the miserie of man is great vpon him."
Ecclesiastes,8,7,For he knoweth not that which shalbe: for who can tell him when it shalbe?
Ecclesiastes,8,8,"Man is not lorde ouer the spirit to retaine the spirite: neither hath hee power in the day of death, nor deliuerance in the battell, neither shall wickednesse deliuer the possessers thereof."

Ecclesiastes,8,10,"And likewise I sawe the wicked buried, and they returned, and they that came from the holy place, were yet forgotten in the citie where they had done right: this also is vanitie."
Ecclesiastes,8,11,"Because sentence against an euill worke is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully set in them to doe euill."
Ecclesiastes,8,12,"Though a sinner doe euill an hundreth times, and God prolongeth his dayes, yet I knowe that it shalbe well with them that feare the Lord, and doe reuerence before him."
Ecclesiastes,8,13,"But it shall not be well to the wicked, neither shall he prolong his dayes: he shall be like a shadowe, because he feareth not before God."
Ecclesiastes,8,14,"There is a vanitie, which is done vpon the earth, that there be righteous men to whom it commeth according to the worke of the wicked: and there be wicked men to whom it commeth according to the worke of the iust: I thought also that this is vanitie."
Ecclesiastes,8,15,"And I praysed ioy: for there is no goodnesse to man vnder the sunne, saue to eate and to drinke and to reioyce: for this is adioyned to his labour, the dayes of his life that God hath giuen him vnder the sunne."
Ecclesiastes,8,16,"When I applied mine heart to knowe wisedome, and to behold the busines that is done on earth, that neither day nor night the eyes of man take sleepe,"
Ecclesiastes,8,17,"Then I behelde the whole worke of God, that man cannot finde out ye worke that is wrought vnder the sunne: for the which man laboureth to seeke it, and cannot finde it: yea, and though the wise man thinke to knowe it, he cannot finde it."
Ecclesiastes,9,1,"I have surely giuen mine heart to all this, and to declare all this, that the iust, and the wise, and their workes are in the hand of God: and no man knoweth eyther loue or hatred of all that is before them."
Ecclesiastes,9,2,"All things come alike to all: and the same condition is to the iust and to the wicked, to the good and to the pure, and to the polluted, and to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner, he that sweareth, as he that feareth an othe."
Ecclesiastes,9,3,"This is euill among all that is done vnder the sunne, that there is one condition to all, and also the heart of the sonnes of men is full of euill, and madnes is in their heartes whiles they liue, and after that, they goe to the dead."
Ecclesiastes,9,4,"Surely whosoeuer is ioyned to all ye liuing, there is hope: for it is better to a liuing dog, then to a dead lyon."
Ecclesiastes,9,5,"For the liuing knowe that they shall dye, but the dead knowe nothing at all: neither haue they any more a rewarde: for their remembrance is forgotten."
Ecclesiastes,9,6,"Also their loue, and their hatred, and their enuie is now perished, and they haue no more portion for euer, in all that is done vnder the sunne."
Ecclesiastes,9,7,"Goe, eate thy bread with ioy, and drinke thy wine with a cheerefull heart: for God nowe accepteth thy workes."
Ecclesiastes,9,8,"At all times let thy garments be white, and let not oyle be lacking vpon thine head."

Ecclesiastes,9,10,"All that thine hand shall finde to doe, doe it with all thy power: for there is neither worke nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wisedome in the graue whither thou goest."
Ecclesiastes,9,11,"I returned, and I sawe vnder the sunne that the race is not to the swift, nor the battell to the strong, nor yet bread to the wise, nor also riches to men of vnderstanding, neither yet fauour to men of knowledge: but time and chance commeth to them all."
Ecclesiastes,9,12,"For neither doth man knowe his time, but as the fishes which are taken in an euill net, and as the birdes that are caught in the snare: so are the children of men snared in the euill time when it falleth vpon them suddenly."
Ecclesiastes,9,13,"I haue also seene this wisedome vnder the sunne, and it is great vnto me."
Ecclesiastes,9,14,"A litle citie and fewe men in it, and a great King came against it, and compassed it about, and builded fortes against it."
Ecclesiastes,9,15,"And there was founde therein a poore and wise man, and he deliuered the citie by his wisedome: but none remembred this poore man."
Ecclesiastes,9,16,"Then said I, Better is wisdome then strength: yet the wisedome of the poore is despised, and his wordes are not heard."
Ecclesiastes,9,17,"The wordes of the wise are more heard in quietnes, then the crye of him that ruleth among fooles."
Ecclesiastes,9,18,Better is wisedome then weapons of warre: but one sinner destroyeth much good.
Ecclesiastes,10,1,"Dead flies cause to stinke, and putrifie the ointment of the apoticarie: so doeth a litle follie him that is in estimation for wisedome, and for glorie."
Ecclesiastes,10,2,The heart of a wise man is at his right hand: but the heart of a foole is at his left hand.
Ecclesiastes,10,3,"And also when the foole goeth by the way, his heart faileth, and he telleth vnto all that he is a foole."
