Ezekiel,1,1,"It came to passe in the thirtieth yere in the fourth moneth, and in the fift day of the moneth (as I was among the captiues by the riuer Chebar) that the heauens were opened and I sawe visions of GOD."
Ezekiel,1,2,In the fift day of the moneth (which was the fift yere of King Ioiachins captiuitie)
Ezekiel,1,3,"The word of the Lord came vnto Ezekiel the Priest, the sonne of Buzi, in the lande of the Caldeans, by the riuer Chebar, where the hande of the Lord was vpon him."
Ezekiel,1,4,"And I looked, and beholde, a whirlewinde came out of the North, a great cloude and a fire wrapped about it, and a brightnesse was about it, and in the middes thereof, to wit, in the middes of the fire came out as the likenesse of amber."
Ezekiel,1,5,"Also out of the middes therof came the likenesse of foure beastes, and this was their forme: they had the appearance of a man."
Ezekiel,1,6,"And euery one had foure faces, and euery one had foure wings."
Ezekiel,1,7,"And their feete were streight feete, and the sole of their feete was like the sole of a calues foote, and they sparkled like the appearance of bright brasse."
Ezekiel,1,8,"And the handes of a man came out from vnder their wings in the foure parts of them, and they foure had their faces, and their wings."
Ezekiel,1,9,"They where ioyned by their wings one to another, and when they went forth, they returned not, but euery one went streight forward."
Ezekiel,1,10,"And the similitude of their faces was as the face of a man: and they foure had the face of a lyon on the right side, and they foure had the face of a bullocke on the left side: they foure also had the face of an eagle."
Ezekiel,1,11,"Thus were their faces: but their wings were spred out aboue: two wings of euery one were ioined one to another, and two couered their bodies."
Ezekiel,1,12,"And euery one went streight forward: they went whither their spirit led them, and they returned not when they went forth."
Ezekiel,1,13,"The similitude also of the beasts, and their appearance was like burning coles of fire, and like the appearance of lampes: for the fire ran among the beastes, and the fire gaue a glister, and out of the fire there went lightning."
Ezekiel,1,14,"And the beastes ranne, and returned like vnto lightning."
Ezekiel,1,15,"Nowe as I behelde the beastes, beholde, a wheele appeared vpon the earth by the beastes, hauing foure faces."
Ezekiel,1,16,"The facion of the wheeles and their worke was like vnto a chrysolite: and they foure had one forme, and their facion, and their worke was as one wheele in another wheele."
Ezekiel,1,17,"Whe they went, they went vpon their foure sides, and they returned not when they went."
Ezekiel,1,18,"They had also rings, and height, and were fearefull to beholde, and their rings were full of eyes, round about them foure."
Ezekiel,1,19,"And when the beastes went, the wheeles went with them: and when the beasts were lift vp from the earth, the wheeles were lift vp."
Ezekiel,1,20,"Whither the spirit led them, they went, and thither did the spirite of the wheeles leade them, and the wheeles were lifted vp besides them: for the spirit of the beastes was in the wheeles."
Ezekiel,1,21,"When the beastes went, they went, and when they stoode, they stoode, and when they were lifted vp from the earth, the wheeles were lifted vp besides them: for the spirite of the beastes was in the wheeles."
Ezekiel,1,22,"And the similitude of the firmament vpon the heads of the beasts was wonderfull, like vnto chrystall, spred ouer their heads aboue."
Ezekiel,1,23,"And vnder the firmament were their wings streight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which couered the, and euery one had two, which couered their bodies."
Ezekiel,1,24,"And when they went foorth, I heard the noyse of their wings, like the noyse of great waters, and as the voyce of the Almightie, euen the voyce of speach, as the noyse of an host: and when they stood, they let downe their wings."
Ezekiel,1,25,"And there was a voyce from the firmament, that was ouer their heads, when they stoode, and had let downe their wings."
Ezekiel,1,26,"And aboue the firmament that was ouer their heads, was the facion of a throne like vnto a saphir stone, and vpon the similitude of the throne was by appearance, as the similitude of a man aboue vpon it."
Ezekiel,1,27,"And I sawe as the appearance of amber, and as the similitude of fire round about within it to looke to, euen from his loynes vpwarde: and to looke to, euen from his loynes downewarde, I sawe as a likenesse of fire, and brightnesse round about it."
Ezekiel,1,28,"As the likenesse of the bowe, that is in the cloude in the day of raine, so was the appearance of the light round about."
Ezekiel,1,29,"This was the appearance of the similitude of the glorie of the Lord: and when I sawe it, I fell vpon my face, and I heard a voyce of one that spake."
Ezekiel,2,1,"And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, stand vp vpon thy feete, and I wil speake vnto thee."
Ezekiel,2,2,"And the Spirite entred into me, when he had spoken vnto me, and set me vpon my feete, so that I heard him that spake vnto me."
Ezekiel,2,3,"And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: for they and their fathers haue rebelled against me, euen vnto this very day."
Ezekiel,2,4,"For they are impudent children, and stiffe hearted: I do send thee vnto them, and thou shalt say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,2,5,"But surely they will not heare, neither in deede will they cease: for they are a rebellious house: yet shall they knowe that there hath bene a Prophet among them."
Ezekiel,2,6,"And thou sonne of man, feare them not, neither be afraide of their wordes, although rebels, and thornes be with thee, and thou remainest with scorpions: feare not their wordes, nor be afrayde at their lookes, for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,2,7,"Therefore thou shalt speake my words vnto them: but surely they will not heare, neither will they in deede cease: for they are rebellious."
Ezekiel,2,8,"But thou sonne of man, heare what I say vnto thee: be not thou rebellious, like this rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eate that I giue thee."
Ezekiel,2,9,"And when I looked vp, beholde, an hande was sent vnto me, and loe, a roule of a booke was therein."
Ezekiel,2,10,"And he spred it before me, and it was written within and without, and there was written therein, Lamentations, and mourning, and woe."
Ezekiel,3,1,"Moreover he saide vnto me, Sonne of man, eate that thou findest: eate this roule, and goe, and speake vnto the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,3,2,"So I opened my mouth, and he gaue mee this roule to eate."
Ezekiel,3,3,"And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, cause thy belly to eate, and fill thy bowels with this roule that I giue thee. Then did I eate it, and it was in my mouth as sweete as honie."
Ezekiel,3,4,"And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, goe, and enter into the house of Israel, and declare them my wordes."
Ezekiel,3,5,"For thou art not sent to a people of an vnknowen tongue, or of an hard language, but to the house of Israel,"
Ezekiel,3,6,"Not to many people of an vnknowen tongue, or of an harde language, whose wordes thou canst not vnderstand: yet if I should sende thee to them, they would obey thee."
Ezekiel,3,7,"But the house of Israel will not obey thee: for they will not obey me: yea, all the house of Israel are impudent and stiffe hearted."
Ezekiel,3,8,"Beholde, I haue made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead harde against their foreheads."
Ezekiel,3,9,"I haue made thy forehead as the adamant, and harder then the flint: feare them not therefore, neither be afraid at their lookes: for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,3,10,"He said moreouer vnto me, Sonne of man, receiue in thine heart al my words that I speake vnto thee, and heare them with thine eares,"
Ezekiel,3,11,"And goe and enter to them that are led away captiues vnto the children of thy people, and speake vnto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord God: but surely they will not heare, neither will they in deede cease."
Ezekiel,3,12,"Then the spirite tooke me vp, and I heard behinde me a noise of a great russhing, saying, Blessed be ye glorie of the Lord out of his place."
Ezekiel,3,13,"I heard also the noyse of the wings of the beasts, that touched one another, and the ratling of the wheeles that were by them, euen a noyse of a great russhing."
Ezekiel,3,14,"So the spirit lift me vp, and tooke me away and I went in bitternesse, and indignation of my spirite, but the hand of the Lord was strong vpon me."
Ezekiel,3,15,"Then I came to them that were led away captiues to Tel-abib, that dwelt by the riuer Chebar, and I sate where they sate, and remained there astonished among them seuen dayes."
Ezekiel,3,16,"And at the ende of seuen dayes, the worde of the Lord came againe vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,3,17,"Sonne of man, I haue made thee a watchman vnto the house of Israel: therefore heare the worde at my mouth, and giue them warning from me."
Ezekiel,3,18,"When I shall say vnto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die, and thou giuest not him warning, nor speakest to admonish the wicked of his wicked way, that he may liue, the same wicked man shall die in his iniquitie: but his blood will I require at thine hande."
Ezekiel,3,19,"Yet if thou warne the wicked, and he turne not from his wickednesse, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquitie, but thou hast deliuered thy soule."
Ezekiel,3,20,"Likewise if a righteous man turne from his righteousnesse, and commit iniquitie, I will lay a stumbling blocke before him, and he shall die, because thou hast not giuen him warning: he shall die in his sinne, and his righteous deedes, which he hath done, shall not be remembred: but his blood will I require at thine hand."
Ezekiel,3,21,"Neuerthelesse, if thou admonish that righteous man, that the righteous sinne not, and that he doeth not sinne, he shall liue because he is admonished: also thou hast deliuered thy soule."
Ezekiel,3,22,"And the hande of the Lord was there vpon me, and he said vnto me, Arise, and goe into the fielde, and I will there talke with thee."
Ezekiel,3,23,"So when I had risen vp, and gone foorth into the fielde, beholde, the glorie of the Lord stoode there, as the glorie which I sawe by the riuer Chebar, and I fell downe vpon my face."
Ezekiel,3,24,"Then the Spirit entred into me, which set me vp vpon my feete, and spake vnto me, and said to me, Come, and shut thy selfe within thine house."
Ezekiel,3,25,"But thou, O sonne of man, beholde, they shall put bandes vpon thee, and shall binde thee with them, and thou shalt not goe out among them."
Ezekiel,3,26,"And I will make thy tongue cleaue to the roofe of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dume, and shalt not be to them as a man that rebuketh: for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,3,27,"But when I shall haue spoken vnto thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, He that heareth, let him heare, and he that leaueth off, let him leaue: for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,4,1,"Thou also sonne of man, take thee a bricke, and lay it before thee, and pourtray vpon it the citie, euen Ierusalem,"
Ezekiel,4,2,"And lay siege against it, and builde a fort against it, and cast a mount against it: set the campe also against it, and lay engins of warre against it rounde about."
Ezekiel,4,3,"Moreouer, take an yron pan, and set it for a wall of yron betweene thee and the citie, and direct thy face towarde it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it: this shall be a signe vnto the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,4,4,"Sleepe thou also vpon thy left side, and lay the iniquitie of the house of Israel vpon it: according to the nomber of the dayes, that thou shalt sleepe vpon it, thou shalt beare their iniquity."
Ezekiel,4,5,"For I haue layed vpon thee the yeeres of their iniquitie, according to the nomber of the dayes, euen three hundreth and ninetie dayes: so shalt thou beare the iniquitie of the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,4,6,"And when thou hast accomplished them, sleepe againe vpon thy right side, and thou shalt beare the iniquitie of the house of Iudah fourtie dayes: I haue appointed thee a day for a yeere, euen a day for a yeere."
Ezekiel,4,7,"Therefore thou shalt direct thy face towarde the siege of Ierusalem, and thine arme shalbe vncouered, and thou shalt prophesie against it."
Ezekiel,4,8,"And beholde, I will lay bands vpon thee, and thou shalt not turne thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the dayes of thy siege."
Ezekiel,4,9,"Thou shalt take also vnto thee wheate, and barley, and beanes, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessell, and make thee bread thereof according to the nomber of the dayes, that thou shalt sleepe vpon thy side: euen three hundreth and ninetie dayes shalt thou eate thereof."
Ezekiel,4,10,"And the meate, whereof thou shalt eate, shalbe by weight, euen twenty shekels a day: and from time to time shalt thou eate thereof."
Ezekiel,4,11,"Thou shalt drinke also water by measure, euen the sixt part of an Hin: from time to time shalt thou drinke."
Ezekiel,4,12,"And thou shalt eate it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it in the dongue that commeth out of man, in their sight."
Ezekiel,4,13,"And the Lord said, So shall the children of Israel eate their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will cast them."
Ezekiel,4,14,"Then said I, Ah, Lord God, beholde, my soule hath not bene polluted: for from my youth vp, euen vnto this houre, I haue not eaten of a thing dead, or torne in pieces, neither came there any vncleane flesh in my mouth."
Ezekiel,4,15,"Then he said vnto me, Loe, I haue giuen thee bullockes dongue for mans dongue, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith."
Ezekiel,4,16,"Moreouer, he said vnto me, Sonne of man, beholde, I will breake the staffe of bread in Ierusalem, and they shall eate bread by weight, and with care, and they shall drinke water by measure, and with astonishment."
Ezekiel,4,17,"Because that bread and water shall faile, they shalbe astonied one with another, and shall consume away for their iniquitie."
Ezekiel,5,1,"And thou sonne of man, take thee a sharpe knife, or take thee a barbours rasor and cause it to passe vpon thine head, and vpon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and deuide the heare."
Ezekiel,5,2,"Thou shalt burne with fire the thirde part in the middes of the citie, when the dayes of the siege are fulfilled, and thou shalt take the other thirde part, and smite about it with a knife, and the last thirde part thou shalt scatter in the winde, and I will drawe out a sworde after them."
Ezekiel,5,3,"Thou shalt also take thereof a fewe in nomber, and binde them in thy lappe."
Ezekiel,5,4,"Then take of them againe and cast them into the middes of the fire, and burne them in the fire: for thereof shall a fire come foorth into all the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,5,5,"Thus saith the Lord God, This is Ierusalem: I haue set it in the middes of the nations and countreyes, that are rounde about her."
Ezekiel,5,6,"And she hath changed my iudgements into wickednes more then the nations, and my statutes more then the countreis, that are round about her: for they haue refused my iudgemets and my statutes, and they haue not walked in them."
Ezekiel,5,7,"Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Because your multitude is greater then the nations that are rounde about you, and ye haue not walked in my statutes, neither haue ye kept my iudgements: no, ye haue not done according to the iudgements of the nations, that are rounde about you,"
Ezekiel,5,8,"Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Beholde, I, euen I come against thee, and will execute iudgement in the middes of thee, euen in the sight of the nations."
Ezekiel,5,9,"And I will doe in thee, that I neuer did before, neither will do any more the like, because of all thine abominations."
Ezekiel,5,10,"For in the middes of thee, the fathers shall eate their sonnes, and the sonnes shall eate their fathers, and I will execute iudgement in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the windes."
Ezekiel,5,11,"Wherefore, as I liue, saith the Lord God, Surely because thou hast defiled my Sanctuarie with all thy filthinesse, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also destroy thee, neither shall mine eye spare thee, neither will I haue any pitie."
Ezekiel,5,12,"The third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they bee consumed in the middes of thee: and another third part shall fall by the sword round about thee: and I will scatter the last third part into all windes, and I will drawe out a sword after them."
Ezekiel,5,13,"Thus shall mine anger bee accomplished, and I will cause my wrath to cease in them, and I will be comforted: and they shall knowe, that I the Lord haue spoke it in my zeale, when I haue accomplished my wrath in them."
Ezekiel,5,14,"Moreouer, I will make thee waste, and abhorred among the nations, that are round about thee, and in the sight of all that passe by."
Ezekiel,5,15,"So thou shalt bee a reproche and shame, a chastisement and an astonishment vnto the nations, that are rounde about thee, when I shall execute iudgements in thee, in anger and in wrath, and in sharpe rebukes: I the Lord haue spoken it."
Ezekiel,5,16,"When I shall sende vpon them the euill arrowes of famine, which shalbe for their destruction, and which I will sende to destroy you: and I will encrease the famine vpon you, and wil breake your staffe of bread."
Ezekiel,5,17,"So will I send vpon you famine, and euill beastes, and they shall spoyle thee, and pestilence and blood shall passe through thee, and I will bring the sworde vpon thee: I the Lord haue spoken it."
Ezekiel,6,1,"Again the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,6,2,"Sonne of man, Set thy face towardes the mountaines of Israel, and prophecie against them,"
Ezekiel,6,3,"And say, Ye mountaines of Israel, heare the worde of the Lord God: thus sayth the Lord God to the mountaines and to the hilles, to the riuers and to the valleis, Beholde, I, euen I will bring a sworde vpon you, and I will destroy your hie places:"
Ezekiel,6,4,"And your altars shalbe desolate, and your images of the sunne shalbe broken: and I will cast downe your slaine men before your idoles."
Ezekiel,6,5,"And I will lay the dead carkeises of the children of Israel before their idoles, and I will scatter your bones round about your altars."
Ezekiel,6,6,"In all your dwelling places the cities shalbe desolate, and the hie places shalbe laide waste, so that your altars shalbe made waste and desolate, and your idoles shalbe broken, and cease, and your images of the sunne shalbe cut in pieces, and your workes shalbe abolished."
Ezekiel,6,7,"And the slaine shall fall in the middes of you, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,6,8,"Yet will I leaue a remnant, that you may haue some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when you shalbe scattred through the countreyes."
Ezekiel,6,9,"And they that escape of you, shall remember me among the nations, where they shalbe in captiuitie, because I am grieued for their whorish hearts, which haue departed from mee, and for their eyes, which haue gone a whoring after their idoles, and they shalbe displeased in them selues for the euils, which they haue committed in all their abominations."
Ezekiel,6,10,"And they shall knowe that I am the Lord, and that I haue not saide in vaine, that I woulde doe this euill vnto them."
Ezekiel,6,11,"Thus saith the Lord God, Smite with thine hand, and stretch forth with thy foote, and say, Alas, for all the wicked abominations of the house of Israel: for they shall fall by the sworde, by the famine, and by the pestilence."
Ezekiel,6,12,"He that is farre off, shall dye of the pestilence, and he that is neere, shall fall by the sword, and hee that remaineth and is besieged, shall dye by the famine: thus will I accomplish my wrath vpon them."
Ezekiel,6,13,"Then ye shall knowe, that I am ye Lord, when their slaine men shalbe among their idoles round about their altars, vpon euerie hie hill in al the toppes of the mountaines, and vnder euery greene tree, and vnder euerie thicke oke, which is the place where they did offer sweete sauour to all their idoles."
Ezekiel,6,14,"So will I stretch mine hand vpon them, and make the lande waste, and desolate from the wildernes vnto Diblath in all their habitations, and they shall know, that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,7,1,"Moreover the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,7,2,"Also thou sonne of man, thus saith the Lord God, An ende is come vnto the lande of Israel: the ende is come vpon the foure corners of the lande."
Ezekiel,7,3,"Nowe is the ende come vpon thee, and I wil sende my wrath vpon thee, and will iudge thee according to thy wayes, and will laye vpon thee all thine abominations."
Ezekiel,7,4,"Neither shall mine eye spare thee, neither will I haue pitie: but I will laye thy waies vpon thee: and thine abomination shall bee in the middes of thee, and yee shall knowe that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,7,5,"Thus saith the Lord God, Beholde, one euil, euen one euill is come."
Ezekiel,7,6,"An ende is come, the end is come, it watched for thee: beholde, it is come."
Ezekiel,7,7,"The morning is come vnto thee, that dwellest in the lande: the time is come, the day of trouble is neere, and not the sounding againe of the mountaines."
Ezekiel,7,8,"Now I will shortly powre out my wrath vpon thee, and fulfil mine anger vpon thee: I will iudge thee according to thy wayes, and will lay vpon thee all thine abominations."
Ezekiel,7,9,"Neither shall mine eie spare thee, neither will I haue pitie, but I will laye vpon thee according to thy wayes, and thine abominations shalbe in the middes of thee, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lord that smiteth."
Ezekiel,7,10,"Beholde, the day, beholde, it is come: the morning is gone forth, the rod florisheth: pride hath budded."
Ezekiel,7,11,"Crueltie is risen vp into a rod of wickednes: none of them shall remaine, nor of their riches, nor of any of theirs, neither shall there bee lamentation for them."
Ezekiel,7,12,"The time is come, the day draweth neere: let not the byer reioyce, nor let him that selleth, mourne: for the wrath is vpon al the multitude thereof."
Ezekiel,7,13,"For hee that selleth, shall not returne to that which is solde, although they were yet aliue: for the vision was vnto al the multitude thereof, and they returned not, neither doeth any encourage himselfe in the punishment of his life."
Ezekiel,7,14,"They haue blowen the trumpet, and prepared all, but none goeth to the battel: for my wrath is vpon all the multitude thereof."
Ezekiel,7,15,"The sword is without, and the pestilence, and the famine within: he that is in the field, shall dye with the sword, and he that is in the citie, famine and pestilence shall deuoure him."
Ezekiel,7,16,"But they that flee away from them, shall escape, and shalbe in the mountaines, like the doues of the valleis: all they shall mourne, euery one for his iniquitie."
Ezekiel,7,17,"All handes shalbe weake, and all knees shall fall away as water."
Ezekiel,7,18,"They shall also girde them selues with sackecloth, and feare shall couer them, and shame shalbe vpon all faces, and baldnes vpon their heads."
Ezekiel,7,19,"They shall cast their siluer in the streetes, and their golde shalbe cast farre off: their siluer and their gold can not deliuer them in the day of the wrath of the Lord: they shall not satisfie their soules, neither fill their bowels: for this ruine is for their iniquitie."
Ezekiel,7,20,"He had also set the beautie of his ornament in maiestie: but they made images of their abominations, and of their idoles therein: therefore haue I set it farre from them."
Ezekiel,7,21,"And I will giue it into the handes of the strangers to be spoyled, and to the wicked of the earth to be robbed, and they shall pollute it."
Ezekiel,7,22,"My face will I turne also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the destroyers shall enter into it, and defile it."
Ezekiel,7,23,"Make a chaine: for the lande is full of the iudgement of blood, and the citie is full of crueltie."
Ezekiel,7,24,"Wherefore I will bring the most wicked of the heathen, and they shall possesse their houses: I will also make the pompe of the mightie to cease, and their holie places shalbe defiled."
Ezekiel,7,25,"When destruction commeth, they shall seeke peace, and shall not haue it."
Ezekiel,7,26,"Calamitie shall come vpon calamitie, and rumour shall bee vpon rumour: then shall they seeke a vision of the Prophet: but the Lawe shall perish from the Priest, and counsel from the Ancient."
Ezekiel,7,27,"The King shall mourne, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the handes of the people in the land shall be troubled: I wil doe vnto them according to their waies, and according to their iudgements will I iudge them, and they shall knowe that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,8,1,"And in the sixt yere, in the sixt moneth, and in the fift day of the moneth, as I sate in mine house, and the Elders of Iudah sate before me, the hand of the Lord God fell there vpon me."
Ezekiel,8,2,"Then I beheld, and lo, there was a likenesse, as the appearance of fire, to looke to, from his loynes downeward, and from his loynes vpward, as the appearance of brightnes, and like vnto amber."
Ezekiel,8,3,"And he stretched out the likenes of an had, and tooke me by an hearie locke of mine head, and the Spirit lift me vp betweene the earth, and the heauen, and brought mee by a Diuine vision to Ierusalem, into the entry of ye inner gate that lieth toward the North, where remained the idole of indignation, which prouoked indignation."
Ezekiel,8,4,"And beholde, the glorie of the God of Israel was there according to the vision, that I saw in the fielde."
Ezekiel,8,5,"Then saide he vnto mee, Sonne of man, lift vp thine eyes nowe towarde the North. So I lift vp mine eyes towarde the North, and beholde, Northward, at the gate of the altar, this idole of indignation was in the entrie."
Ezekiel,8,6,"He said furthermore vnto me, Sonne of man, seest thou not what they doe? euen the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here to cause me to depart from my Sanctuarie? but yet turne thee and thou shalt see greater abominations."
Ezekiel,8,7,"And he caused me to enter at the gate of the court: and when I looked, beholde, an hole was in the wall."
Ezekiel,8,8,"Then said he vnto me, Sonne of man, digge nowe in the wall. And when I had digged in the wall, beholde, there was a doore."
Ezekiel,8,9,"And he said vnto mee, Go in, and beholde the wicked abominations that they doe here."
Ezekiel,8,10,"So I went in, and sawe, and beholde, there was euery similitude of creeping thinges and abominable beasts and all the idoles of the house of Israel painted vpon the wall round about."
Ezekiel,8,11,"And there stoode before them seuentie men of the Ancients of the house of Israel, and in the middes of them stoode Iaazaniah, ye sonne of Shaphan, with euerie man his censour in his hand, and the vapour of the incense went vp like a cloude."
Ezekiel,8,12,"Then saide hee vnto mee, Sonne of man, hast thou seene what the Ancients of the house of Israel do in the darke, euery one in the chamber of his imagerie? for they say, The Lord seeth vs not, the Lord hath forsaken the earth."
Ezekiel,8,13,"Againe he saide also vnto me, Turne thee againe, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they doe."
Ezekiel,8,14,"And he caused me to enter into the entrie of the gate of the Lords house, which was toward the North: and beholde there sate women mourning for Tammuz."
Ezekiel,8,15,"Then saide hee vnto me, Hast thou seene this, O sonne of man? Turne thee againe, and thou shalt see greater abominations then these."
Ezekiel,8,16,"And he caused me to enter into the inner court of the Lordes house, and beholde, at the doore of the Temple of the Lord, betweene the porche and the altar were about fiue and twentie men with their backs toward the Temple of the Lord, and their faces towarde the East, and they worshipped the sunne, towarde the East."
Ezekiel,8,17,"The he said vnto me, Hast thou seene this, O sonne of man? Is it a small thing to the house of Iudah to commit these abominations which they do here? for they haue filled the land with crueltie, and haue returned to prouoke mee: and loe, they haue cast out stinke before their noses."
Ezekiel,8,18,"Therefore will I also execute my wrath: mine eye shall not spare them, neither will I haue pitie, and though they crie in mine eares with a loude voyce, yet will I not heare them."
Ezekiel,9,1,"He cryed also with a loude voyce in mine eares, saying, The visitations of the citie draw neere, and euery man hath a weapon in his hande to destroy it."
Ezekiel,9,2,"And beholde, sixe men came by the way of the hie gate, which lieth towarde the North, and euery man a weapon in his hande to destroy it: and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writers ynkhorne by his side, and they went in and stoode beside the brasen altar."
Ezekiel,9,3,"And the glorie of the God of Israel was gone vp from ye Cherub, whereupon he was and stoode on the doore of the house, and he called to the man clothed with linnen, which had the writers ynkhorne by his side."
Ezekiel,9,4,"And the Lord said vnto him, Goe through the middes of the citie, euen through the middes of Ierusalem and set a marke vpon the foreheads of them that mourne, and cry for all the abominations that be done in the middes thereof."
Ezekiel,9,5,"And to the other he said, that I might heare, Goe ye after him through the citie, and smite: let your eye spare none, neither haue pitie."
Ezekiel,9,6,"Destroy vtterly the old, and the yong, and the maides, and the children, and the women, but touch no man, vpon whome is the marke, and begin at my Sanctuarie. Then they began at the Ancient men, which were before the house."
Ezekiel,9,7,"And he sayde vnto them, Defile the house, and fill the courtes with the slaine, then goe foorth: and they went out, and slewe them in the citie."
Ezekiel,9,8,"Nowe when they had slaine them, and I had escaped, I fell downe vpon my face, and cryed, saying, Ah Lord God, wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel, in powring out thy wrath vpon Ierusalem?"
Ezekiel,9,9,"Then saide he vnto me, The iniquitie of the house of Israel, and Iudah is exceeding great, so that the lande is full of blood, and the citie full of corrupt iudgement: for they say, The Lord hath forsaken the earth, and the Lord seeth vs not."
Ezekiel,9,10,"As touching me also, mine eye shall not spare them, neither will I haue pitie, but will recompence their wayes vpon their heades."
Ezekiel,9,11,"And beholde, the man clothed with linen which had the ynkhorne by his side, made report, and saide, Lord, I haue done as thou hast commanded me."
Ezekiel,10,1,"And as I looked, beholde, in the firmament that was aboue the head of the Cherubims there appeared vpon them like vnto the similitude of a throne, as it were a saphir stone."
Ezekiel,10,2,"And he spake vnto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in betweene the wheeles, euen vnder the Cherub, and fill thine hands with coales of fire from betweene the Cherubims, and scatter the ouer the citie. And he went in in my sight."
Ezekiel,10,3,"Now the Cherubims stood vpon the right side of the house, when the man went in, and the cloude filled the inner court."
Ezekiel,10,4,"Then the glorie of the Lord went vp from the Cherub, and stoode ouer the doore of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightnesse of the Lordes glorie."
Ezekiel,10,5,"And the sound of the Cherubims wings was heard into the vtter court, as the voyce of the Almightie God, when he speaketh."
Ezekiel,10,6,"And when he had commanded the man clothed with linnen, saying, Take fire from betweene the wheeles, and from betweene ye Cherubims, then he went in and stood beside ye wheele."
Ezekiel,10,7,"And one Cherub stretched forth his hand from betweene the Cherubims vnto the fire, that was betweene the Cherubims, and tooke thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linnen: who tooke it and went out."
Ezekiel,10,8,"And there appeared in the Cherubims, the likenesse of a mans hande vnder their wings."
Ezekiel,10,9,"And when I looked vp, beholde, foure wheeles were beside the Cherubims, one wheele by one Cherub, and another wheele by another Cherub, and the appearance of the wheeles was as the colour of a Chrysolite stone."
Ezekiel,10,10,And their appearance (for they were all foure of one facion) was as if one wheele had bene in another wheele.
Ezekiel,10,11,"When they went foorth, they went vpon their foure sides, and they returned not as they went: but to the place whither the first went, they went after it, and they turned not as they went."
Ezekiel,10,12,"And their whole bodie, and their rings, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheeles were full of eyes round about, euen in the same foure wheeles."
Ezekiel,10,13,"And the Cherub cryed to these wheeles in mine hearing, saying, O wheele."
Ezekiel,10,14,"And euery beast had foure faces: the first face was the face of a Cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the thirde the face of a lyon, and the fourth the face of an Egle."
Ezekiel,10,15,And the Cherubims were lifted vp: this is the beast that I sawe at the riuer Chebar.
Ezekiel,10,16,"And when ye Cherubims went, the wheeles went by them: and when the Cherubims lift vp their wings to mount vp from the earth, the same wheeles also turned not from beside them."
Ezekiel,10,17,"When the Cherubims stoode, they stood: and when they were lifted vp, they lifted the selues vp also: for the spirit of the beast was in them."
Ezekiel,10,18,"Then the glorie of the Lord departed from aboue the doore of the house, and stoode vpon the Cherubims."
Ezekiel,10,19,"And the Cherubims lift vp their wings, and mounted vp from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheeles also were besides them: and euery one stoode at the entrie of the gate of the Lordes House at the East side, and the glorie of the God of Israel was vpon them on hie."
Ezekiel,10,20,"This is the beast that I sawe vnder the God of Israel by the riuer Chebar, and I knewe that they were the Cherubims."
Ezekiel,10,21,"Euery one had foure faces, and euery one foure wings, and the likenesse of mans hands was vnder their wings."
Ezekiel,10,22,"And the likenesse of their faces was the selfe same faces, which I sawe by the riuer Chebar, and the appearance of the Cherubims was ye selfe same, and they went euery one straight forwarde."
Ezekiel,11,1,"Moreover, the Spirite lift me vp, and brought me vnto the East gate of the Lordes house, which lyeth Eastwarde, and beholde, at the entrie of the gate were fiue and twentie men: among whome I sawe Iaazaniah the sonne of Azur, and Pelatiah the sonne of Benaiah, the princes of the people."
Ezekiel,11,2,"Then said he vnto me, Sonne of man, these are the men that imagine mischiefe, and deuise wicked counsell in this citie."
Ezekiel,11,3,"For they say, It is not neere, let vs builde houses: this citie is the caldron, and wee be the flesh."
Ezekiel,11,4,"Therefore prophesie against them, sonne of man, prophesie."
Ezekiel,11,5,"And the Spirite of the Lord fell vpon me, and said vnto me, Speake, Thus saith the Lord, O ye house of Israel, this haue ye said, and I know that which riseth vp of your mindes."
Ezekiel,11,6,"Many haue ye murthered in this citie, and ye haue filled the streets thereof with the slaine."
Ezekiel,11,7,"Therefore thus saith the Lord God, They that ye haue slaine, and haue layed in the middes of it, they are the flesh, and this citie is the caldron, but I wil bring you foorth of the mids of it."
Ezekiel,11,8,"Ye haue feared the sworde, and I wil bring a sworde vpon you, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,11,9,"And I will bring you out of the middes thereof, and deliuer you into the hands of strangers, and will execute iudgements among you."
Ezekiel,11,10,"Ye shall fall by the sworde, and I wil iudge you in the border of Israel, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,11,11,"This citie shall not be your caldron, neyther shall ye be the flesh in the middes thereof, but I will iudge you in the border of Israel."
Ezekiel,11,12,"And ye shall knowe that I am the Lord: for ye haue not walked in my statutes, neither executed my iudgements, but haue done after the maners of the heathen, that are round about you."
Ezekiel,11,13,"And when I prophesied, Pelatiah the sonne of Benaiah dyed: then fell I downe vpon my face, and cryed with a loude voyce, and saide, Ah Lord God, wilt thou then vtterly destroy all the remnant of Israel?"
Ezekiel,11,14,"Againe the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,11,15,"Sonne of man, thy brethren, euen thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, wholy are they vnto whome the inhabitants of Ierusalem haue said, Depart ye farre from the Lord: for the lande is giuen vs in possession."
Ezekiel,11,16,"Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God, Although I haue cast them farre off among the heathen, and although I haue scattered them among the countreis, yet wil I be to them as a litle Sanctuarie in ye countreis where they shall come."
Ezekiel,11,17,"Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God, I will gather you againe from the people, and assemble you out of the countreis where ye haue bene scattered, and I will giue you ye land of Israel."
Ezekiel,11,18,"And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the idoles thereof, and all the abominations thereof from thence."
Ezekiel,11,19,"And I will giue them one heart, and I will put a newe spirit within their bowels: and I will take the stonie heart out of their bodies, and will giue them an heart of flesh,"
Ezekiel,11,20,"That they may walke in my statutes, and keepe my iudgements, and execute them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God."
Ezekiel,11,21,"But vpon them, whose heart is towarde their idoles, and whose affection goeth after their abominations, I will lay their way vpon their owne heades, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,11,22,"Then did the Cherubims lift vp their wings, and the wheeles besides them, and the glorie of the God of Israel was vpon them on hie."
Ezekiel,11,23,"And the glorie of the Lord went vp from the middes of the citie, and stoode vpon the moutaine which is towarde the East side of the citie."
Ezekiel,11,24,"Afterwarde the Spirite tooke me vp, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Caldea to them that were led away captiues: so the vision that I had seene, went vp from me."
Ezekiel,11,25,"Then I declared vnto them that were led away captiues, all the things that the Lord had shewed me."
Ezekiel,12,1,"The worde of the Lord also came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,2,"Sonne of man, thou dwellest in the middes of a rebellious house, which haue eyes to see, and see not: they haue eares to heare, and heare not: for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,12,3,"Therefore thou sonne of man, prepare thy stuffe to goe into captiuitie, and goe foorth by day in their sight: and thou shalt passe from thy place to another place in their sight, if it be possible that they may consider it: for they are a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,12,4,"Then shalt thou bring foorth thy stuffe by day in their sight as the stuffe of him that goeth into captiuitie: and thou shalt go forth at euen in their sight, as they that go foorth into captiuitie."
Ezekiel,12,5,"Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and cary out thereby."
Ezekiel,12,6,"In their sight shalt thou beare it vpon thy shoulders, and carie it foorth in the darke: thou shalt couer thy face that thou see not the earth: for I haue set thee as a signe vnto the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,12,7,"And as I was commanded, so I brought forth my stuffe by day, as ye stuffe of one that goeth into captiuitie: and by night I digged through the wall with mine hand, and brought it forth in ye darke, and I bare it vpon my shoulder in their sight."
Ezekiel,12,8,"And in the morning came the word of the Lord vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,9,"Sonne of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, sayde vnto thee, What doest thou?"
Ezekiel,12,10,"But say thou vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, This burden concerneth the chiefe in Ierusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them."
Ezekiel,12,11,"Say, I am your signe: like as I haue done, so shall it be done vnto them: they shall goe into bondage and captiuitie."
Ezekiel,12,12,"And the chiefest that is among them, shall beare vpon his shoulder in the darke, and shall goe forth: they shall digge through the wall, to cary out thereby: he shall couer his face, that he see not the ground with his eies."
Ezekiel,12,13,"My net also will I spread vpon him, and he shall be taken in my net, and I will bring him to Babel to the lande of the Caldeans, yet shall he not see it, though he shall dye there."
Ezekiel,12,14,"And I will scatter toward euerie winde all that are about him to helpe him, and all his garisons, and I will drawe out the sworde after them."
Ezekiel,12,15,"And they shall knowe that I am the Lord, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countreis."
Ezekiel,12,16,"But I will leaue a litle nomber of them from the sworde, from the famine, and from the pestilence, that they may declare all these abominations among the heathen, where they come, and they shall knowe, that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,12,17,"Moreouer, the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,18,"Sonne of man, eate thy bread with trembling and drinke thy water with trouble, and with carefulnesse,"
Ezekiel,12,19,"And say vnto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord God of the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and of the lande of Israel, They shall eate their bread with carefulnes, and drinke their water with desolation: for the lande shall bee desolate from her abundance because of the crueltie of them that dwell therein."
Ezekiel,12,20,"And the cities that are inhabited, shall be left voyde, and the land shall be desolate, and yee shall knowe that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,12,21,"And the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,22,"Sonne of man, what is that prouerbe that you haue in the land of Israel, saying, The dayes are prolonged and all visions faile?"
Ezekiel,12,23,"Tell them therefore, Thus sayeth the Lord God, I wil make this prouerbe to cease, and they shall no more vse it as a prouerbe in Israel: but say vnto them, The daies are at hand and the effect of euery vision."
Ezekiel,12,24,"For no vision shall be any more in vaine, neither shall there bee any flattering diuination within the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,12,25,"For I am the Lord: I wil speake, and that thing that I shall speake, shall come to passe: it shall be no more prolonged: for in your dayes, O rebellious house, will I saye the thing, and will performe it, sayeth the Lord God."
Ezekiel,12,26,"Againe the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,12,27,"Sonne of man, beholde, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that hee seeth, is for many dayes to come, and he prophecieth of the times that are farre off."
Ezekiel,12,28,"Therefore say vnto them, Thus sayth the Lord God, All my wordes shall no longer be delayed, but that thing which I haue spoken, shall be done, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,13,1,"And the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,13,2,"Sonne of man, prophecie against the prophets of Israel, that prophecie, and say thou vnto them, that prophecie out of their owne hearts, Heare the worde of the Lord."
Ezekiel,13,3,"Thus sayth the Lord God, Woe vnto the foolish Prophets that follow their owne spirit, and haue seene nothing."
Ezekiel,13,4,"O Israel, thy Prophets are like the foxes in the waste places."
Ezekiel,13,5,"Ye haue not risen vp in the gappes, neither made vp the hedge for ye house of Israel, to stand in the battel in the daye of the Lord."
Ezekiel,13,6,"They haue seene vanitie, and lying diuination, saying, The Lord sayth it, and the Lord hath not sent them: and they haue made others to hope that they would cofirme the word of their prophecie."
Ezekiel,13,7,"Haue ye not seene a vaine vision? and haue yee not spoken a lying diuination? ye say, The Lord sayth it, albeit I haue not spoken."
Ezekiel,13,8,"Therefore thus sayth the Lord God, Because ye haue spoken vanytie and haue seene lyes, therefore beholde, I am agaynst you, sayth the Lord God,"
Ezekiel,13,9,"And mine hande shalbe vpon the Prophets that see vanity, and diuine lies: they shall not be in the assemblie of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel: and yee shall know that I am the Lord God."
Ezekiel,13,10,"And therefore, because they haue deceiued my people, saying, Peace, and there was no peace: and one buylt vp a wall, and behold, the others daubed it with vntempered morter,"
Ezekiel,13,11,"Say vnto them which daube it with vntempered morter, that it shall fall: for there shall come a great showre, and I wil sende haylestones, which shall cause it to fall, and a stormie winde shall breake it."
Ezekiel,13,12,"Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not bee sayd vnto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye haue daubed it?"
Ezekiel,13,13,"Therefore thus sayth the Lord God, I will cause a stormie winde to breake foorth in my wrath, and a great showre shall bee in mine anger, and hailestones in mine indignation to consume it."
Ezekiel,13,14,"So I wil destroy the wall that ye haue daubed with vntempered morter, and bring it downe to the ground, so that the fundation thereof shalbe discouered, and it shall fal, and ye shalbe consumed in the middes thereof, and ye shall know, that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,13,15,"Thus will I accomplish my wrath vpon the wall, and vpon them that haue daubed it with vntempered morter, and will say vnto you, The wall is no more, neither the daubers thereof,"
Ezekiel,13,16,"To wit, the Prophets of Israel, which prophesie vpon Ierusalem, and see visions of peace for it, and there is no peace, sayth the Lord God."
Ezekiel,13,17,"Likewise thou sonne of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesie out of their owne heart: and prophesie thou against them, and say,"
Ezekiel,13,18,"Thus sayth the Lord God, Woe vnto the women that sowe pillowes vnder al arme holes, and make vailes vpon the head of euery one that standeth vp, to hunt soules: will yee hunt ye soules of my people, and will yee giue life to the soules that come vnto you?"
Ezekiel,13,19,"And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barly, and for pieces of bread to slay the soules of them that shoulde not dye, and to giue life to the soules that should not liue in lying to my people, that heare your lies?"
Ezekiel,13,20,"Wherefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will haue to do with your pillowes, wherewith yee hunt the soules to make them to flie, and I will teare them from your armes, and will let the soules goe, euen the soules, that ye hunt to make them to flie."
Ezekiel,13,21,"Your vailes also will I teare, and deliuer my people out of your hande, and they shalbe no more in your hands to be hunted, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,13,22,"Because with your lyes yee haue made the heart of the righteous sadde, whome I haue not made sad, and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not returne from his wicked way, by promising him life,"
Ezekiel,13,23,"Therefore ye shall see no more vanitie, nor diuine diuinatios: for I wil deliuer my people out of your hand, and ye shall know that I am ye Lord."
Ezekiel,14,1,"Then came certaine of the Elders of Israel vnto me, and sate before me."
Ezekiel,14,2,"And the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,14,3,"Sonne of man, these men haue set vp their idoles in their heart, and put the stumbling blocke of their iniquitie before their face: should I, being required, answere them?"
Ezekiel,14,4,"Therefore speake vnto them, and say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Euery man of the house of Israel that setteth vp his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumbling blocke of his iniquitie before his face, and commeth to the Prophet, I the Lord will answere him that commeth, according to the multitude of his idoles:"
Ezekiel,14,5,"That I may take the house of Israel in their owne heart, because they are all departed from me through their idoles."
Ezekiel,14,6,"Therfore say vnto the house of Israel, Thus sayth the Lord God, Returne, and withdraw your selues, and turne your faces from your idoles, and turne your faces from all your abominations."
Ezekiel,14,7,"For euery one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that soiourneth in Israel, which departeth from mee, and setteth vp his idoles in his heart, and putteth the stumbling blocke of his iniquitie before his face, and commeth to a Prophet, for to inquire of him for me, I the Lord will answere him for my selfe,"
Ezekiel,14,8,"And I will set my face against that man, and will make him an example and prouerbe, and I will cut him off from the middes of my people, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,14,9,"And if the Prophet be deceiued, when hee hath spoken a thing, I the Lord haue deceiued that Prophet, and I will stretch out mine hande vpon him, and will destroy him from the middes of my people of Israel."
Ezekiel,14,10,"And they shall beare their punishment: the punishment of the Prophet shall bee euen as the punishment of him that asketh,"
Ezekiel,14,11,"That the house of Israel may go no more astray from mee, neither bee polluted any more with all their transgressions, but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, sayth the Lord God."
Ezekiel,14,12,"The worde of the Lord came againe vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,14,13,"Sonne of man, when ye land sinneth against me by committing a trespasse, then will I stretch out mine hand vpon it, and will breake the staffe of the bread thereof, and will send famine vpon it, and I will destroy man and beast forth of it."
Ezekiel,14,14,"Though these three men Noah, Daniel, and Iob were among them, they shoulde deliuer but their owne soules by their righteousnes, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,14,15,"If I bring noysome beastes into the lande and they spoyle it, so that it bee desolate, that no man may passe through, because of beastes,"
Ezekiel,14,16,"Though these three men were in the mids thereof, As I liue, sayth the Lord God, they shall saue neither sonnes nor daughters: they onely shalbe deliuered, but the land shall be waste."
Ezekiel,14,17,"Or if I bring a sworde vpon this land, and say, Sword, go through the land, so that I destroy man and beast out of it,"
Ezekiel,14,18,"Though these three men were in the mids thereof, As I liue, sayth the Lord God, they shall deliuer neither sonnes nor daughters, but they onely shall be deliuered themselues."
Ezekiel,14,19,"Or if I send a pestilence into this land, and powre out my wrath vpon it in blood, to destroy out of it man and beast,"
Ezekiel,14,20,"And though Noah, Daniel and Iob were in the middes of it, As I liue, sayth the Lord God, they shall deliuer neither sonne nor daughter: they shall but deliuer their owne soules by their righteousnes."
Ezekiel,14,21,"For thus saith the Lord God, Howe much more when I sende my foure sore iudgements vpon Ierusalem, euen the sworde, and famine, and the noysome beast and pestilence, to destroy man and beast out of it?"
Ezekiel,14,22,"Yet beholde, therein shalbe left a remnant of them that shalbe caryed away both sonnes and daughters: behold, they shall come forth vnto you, and ye shall see their way, and their enterprises: and ye shall be comforted, concerning the euill that I haue brought vpon Ierusalem, euen concerning al that I haue brought vpon it."
Ezekiel,14,23,"And they shall comfort you, when yee see their way and their enterprises: and ye shall know, that I haue not done without cause all that I haue done in it, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,15,1,"And thee word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,15,2,"Sonne of man, what commeth of the vine tree aboue all other trees? and of the vine braunch, which is among the trees of ye forest?"
Ezekiel,15,3,Shall wood bee taken thereof to doe any worke? or wil men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
Ezekiel,15,4,"Behold, it is cast in the fire to be consumed: the fire consumeth both the endes of it, and the middes of it is burnt. Is it meete for any worke?"
Ezekiel,15,5,"Behold, when it was whole, it was meete for no worke: how much lesse shall it bee meete for any worke, when the fire hath consumed it, and it is burnt?"
Ezekiel,15,6,"Therefore thus sayth the Lord God, As the vine tree, that is among the trees of the forest, which I haue giuen to the fire to be consumed, so will I giue the inhabitants of Ierusalem."
Ezekiel,15,7,"And I will set my face against them: they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall consume them: and ye shall know, that I am the Lord, when I set my face against them,"
Ezekiel,15,8,"And when I make the lande waste, because they haue greatly offended, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,16,1,"Again, the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,16,2,"Sonne of man, cause Ierusalem to knowe her abominations,"
Ezekiel,16,3,"And say, Thus saith the Lord God vnto Ierusalem, Thine habitation and thy kindred is of the land of Canaan: thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite."
Ezekiel,16,4,"And in thy natiuitie whe thou wast borne, thy nauell was not cut: thou wast not washed in water to soften thee: thou wast not salted with salt, nor swadled in cloutes."
Ezekiel,16,5,"None eye pitied thee to do any of these vnto thee, for to haue compassion vpon thee, but thou wast cast out in the open fielde to the contempt of thy person in ye day that thou wast borne."
Ezekiel,16,6,"And when I passed by thee, I saw thee polluted in thine owne blood, and I said vnto thee, whe thou wast in thy blood, Thou shalt liue: euen when thou wast in thy blood, I saide vnto thee, Thou shalt liue."
Ezekiel,16,7,"I haue caused thee to multiplie as the bud of the fielde, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou hast gotten excellent ornaments: thy breastes are facioned, thine heare is growen, where as thou wast naked and bare."
Ezekiel,16,8,"Nowe when I passed by thee, and looked vpon thee, beholde, thy time was as the time of loue, and I spred my skirtes ouer thee, and couered thy filthines: yea, I sware vnto thee, and entred into a couenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine."
Ezekiel,16,9,"Then washed I thee with water: yea, I washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oyle."
Ezekiel,16,10,"I clothed thee also with broydred worke, and shod thee with badgers skin: and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I couered thee with silke."
Ezekiel,16,11,"I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets vpon thine handes, and a chaine on thy necke."
Ezekiel,16,12,"And I put a frontlet vpon thy face, and earings in thine eares, and a beautifull crowne vpon thine head."
Ezekiel,16,13,"Thus wast thou deckt with gold and siluer, and thy rayment was of fine linen, and silke, and broydred worke: thou didest eate fine floure, and honie and oyle, and thou wast very beautifull, and thou didest grow vp into a kingdome."
Ezekiel,16,14,"And thy name was spred among the heathen for thy beautie: for it was perfite through my beautie which I had set vpon thee, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,16,15,"Nowe thou didest trust in thine owne beautie, and playedst the harlot, because of thy renowne, and hast powred out thy fornications on euery one that passed by, thy desire was to him."
Ezekiel,16,16,"And thou didest take thy garments, and deckedst thine hie places with diuers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like thinges shall not come, neither hath any done so."
Ezekiel,16,17,"Thou hast also taken thy faire iewels made of my golde and of my siluer, which I had giuen thee, and madest to thy selfe images of men, and didest commit whoredome with them,"
Ezekiel,16,18,"And tookest thy broydred garments, and coueredst them: and thou hast set mine oyle and my perfume before them."
Ezekiel,16,19,"My meate also, which I gaue thee, as fine floure, oyle, and honie, wherewith I fedde thee, thou hast euen set it before them for a sweete sauour: thus it was, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,16,20,"Moreouer thou hast taken thy sonnes and thy daughters, whome thou hast borne vnto me, and these hast thou sacrificed vnto them, to be deuoured: is this thy whoredome a small matter?"
Ezekiel,16,21,"That thou hast slaine my children, and deliuered them to cause them to passe through fire for them?"
Ezekiel,16,22,"And in all thine abominations and whoredomes thou hast not remembred the dayes of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood."
Ezekiel,16,23,"And beside all thy wickednes (wo, wo vnto thee, saith the Lord God)"
Ezekiel,16,24,"Thou hast also built vnto thee an hie place, and hast made thee an hie place in euery streete."
Ezekiel,16,25,"Thou hast built thine hie place at euery corner of the way, and hast made thy beautie to be abhorred: thou hast opened thy feete to euery one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredome."
Ezekiel,16,26,"Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, which haue great members, and hast encreased thy whoredome, to prouoke me."
Ezekiel,16,27,"Beholde, therefore I did stretche out mine hand ouer thee, and will diminish thine ordinarie, and deliuer thee vnto the will of them that hate thee, euen to the daughters of the Philistims, which are ashamed of thy wicked way."
Ezekiel,16,28,"Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast insaciable: yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied."
Ezekiel,16,29,"Thou hast moreouer multiplied thy fornication from the land of Canaan vnto Caldea, and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith."
Ezekiel,16,30,"Howe weake is thine heart, saith the Lord God, seeing thou doest all these thinges, euen the worke of a presumptuous whorish woman?"
Ezekiel,16,31,"In that thou buildest thine hie place in the corner of euery way, and makest thine hie place in euery streete, and hast not bene as an harlot that despiseth a reward,"
Ezekiel,16,32,"But as a wife that playeth the harlot, and taketh others for her husband:"
Ezekiel,16,33,"They giue giftes to all other whores, but thou giuest giftes vnto all thy louers, and rewardest them, that they may come vnto thee on euery side for thy fornication."
Ezekiel,16,34,"And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy fornications, neither the like fornication shall be after thee: for in that thou giuest a rewarde, and no reward is giuen vnto thee, therefore thou art contrary."
Ezekiel,16,35,"Wherefore, O harlot, heare the worde of the Lord."
Ezekiel,16,36,"Thus sayeth the Lord God, Because thy shame was powred out, and thy filthinesse discouered through thy fornications with thy louers, and with all the idoles of thine abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didest offer vnto them,"
Ezekiel,16,37,"Beholde, therefore I wil gather all thy louers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loued, with al them that thou hast hated: I will euen gather them round about against thee, and will discouer thy filthines vnto them, that they may see all thy filthines."
Ezekiel,16,38,"And I wil iudge thee after ye maner of them that are harlots, and of them that shead blood, and I wil giue thee the blood of wrath and ielousie."
Ezekiel,16,39,"I will also giue thee into their handes, and they shall destroy thine hie place, and shall breake downe thine hie places. they shall strippe thee also out of thy clothes, and shall take thy faire iewels, and leaue thee naked and bare."
Ezekiel,16,40,"They shall also bring vp a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swordes."
Ezekiel,16,41,"And they shall burne vp thine houses with fire, and execute iudgements vpon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt giue no reward any more."
Ezekiel,16,42,"So will I make my wrath towarde thee to rest, and my ielousie shall depart from thee, and I will cease and be no more angrie."
Ezekiel,16,43,"Because thou hast not remembred the dayes of thy youth, but hast prouoked me with all these things, behold, therefore I also haue brought thy way vpon thine head, sayeth the Lord God: yet hast not thou had consideration of all thine abominations."
Ezekiel,16,44,"Beholde, all that vse prouerbes, shall vse this prouerbe against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter."
Ezekiel,16,45,"Thou art thy mothers daughter, that hath cast off her husband and her children, and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which forsooke their husbands and their children: your mother is an Hittite, and your father an Amorite."
Ezekiel,16,46,"And thine elder sister is Samaria, and her daughters, that dwell at thy left hand, and thy yong sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom, and her daughters."
Ezekiel,16,47,"Yet hast thou not walked after their wayes, nor done after their abominations: but as it had bene a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more then they in all thy wayes."
Ezekiel,16,48,"As I liue, saith the Lord God, Sodom thy sister hath not done, neither shee nor her daughters, as thou hast done and thy daughters."
Ezekiel,16,49,"Beholde, this was the iniquitie of thy sister Sodom, Pride, fulnesse of bread, and aboundance of idlenesse was in her, and in her daughters: neither did shee strengthen the hande of the poore and needie."
Ezekiel,16,50,"But they were hautie, and committed abomination before mee: therefore I tooke them away, as pleased me."
Ezekiel,16,51,"Neither hath Samaria committed halfe of thy sinnes, but thou hast exceeded them in thine abominations, and hast iustified thy sisters in all thine abominations, which thou hast done."
Ezekiel,16,52,"Therefore thou which hast iustified thy sisters, beare thine owne shame for thy sinnes, that thou hast committed more abominable then they which are more righteous then thou art: be thou therefore confounded also, and beare thy shame, seeing that thou hast iustified thy sisters."
Ezekiel,16,53,"Therefore I will bring againe their captiuitie with the captiuitie of Sodom, and her daughters, and with the captiuitie of Samaria, and her daughters: euen the captiuitie of thy captiues in the middes of them,"
Ezekiel,16,54,"That thou mayest beare thine owne shame, and mayest bee confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou hast comforted them."
Ezekiel,16,55,"And thy sister Sodom and her daughters shall returne to their former state: Samaria also and her daughters shall returne to their former state, when thou and thy daughters shall returne to your former state."
Ezekiel,16,56,"For thy sister Sodom was not heard of by thy report in the day of thy pride,"
Ezekiel,16,57,"Before thy wickednes was discouered, as in that same time of the reproch of the daughters of Aram, and of all the daughters of the Philistims round about her which despise thee on all sides."
Ezekiel,16,58,"Thou hast borne therefore thy wickednesse and thine abomination, saith the Lord."
Ezekiel,16,59,"For thus saith the Lord God, I might euen deale with thee, as thou hast done: when thou didest despise the othe, in breaking the couenant."
Ezekiel,16,60,"Neuerthelesse, I wil remember my couenant made with thee in ye dayes of thy youth, and I wil confirme vnto thee an euerlasting couenant."
Ezekiel,16,61,"Then thou shalt remember thy wayes, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receiue thy sisters, both thy elder and thy yonger, and I will giue them vnto thee for daughters, but not by thy couenat."
Ezekiel,16,62,"And I wil establish my couenant with thee, and thou shalt knowe that I am the Lord,"
Ezekiel,16,63,"That thou mayest remember, and be ashamed, and neuer open thy mouth any more: because of thy shame when I am pacified toward thee, for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,17,1,"And the worde of the Lord came vnto mee, saying,"
Ezekiel,17,2,"Sonne of man, put foorth a parable and speake a prouerbe vnto the house of Israel,"
Ezekiel,17,3,"And say, Thus saith the Lord God, The great eagle with great wings, and long wings, and ful of fethers, which had diuers colours, came vnto Lebanon, and tooke the highest branch of the cedar,"
Ezekiel,17,4,"And brake off the toppe of his twigge, and caried it into the land of marchants, and set it in a citie of marchants."
Ezekiel,17,5,"Hee tooke also of the seede of the lande, and planted it in a fruitfull ground: hee placed it by great waters, and set it as a willowe tree."
Ezekiel,17,6,"And it budded vp, and was like a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward it, and the rootes thereof were vnder it: so it became a vine, and it brought foorth branches, and shot foorth buds."
Ezekiel,17,7,"There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers, and beholde, this vine did turne her rootes toward it, and spred foorth her branches toward it, that she might water it by the trenches of her plantation."
Ezekiel,17,8,"It was planted in a good soyle by great waters, that it should bring forth branches, and beare fruite, and be an excellent vine."
Ezekiel,17,9,"Say thou, Thus saith the Lord God, Shall it prosper? shall he not pull vp the rootes thereof, and destroy the fruite thereof, and cause them to drie? all the leaues of her bud shall wither without great power, or many people, to plucke it vp by the rootes thereof."
Ezekiel,17,10,"Beholde, it was planted: but shall it prosper? shall it not be dried vp, and wither? when the East winde shall touch it, it shall wither in the trenches, where it grewe."
Ezekiel,17,11,"Moreouer, the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,17,12,"Say now to this rebellious house, Know ye not, what these things meane? tell them, Behold, the King of Babel is come to Ierusalem, and hath taken the King thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babel,"
Ezekiel,17,13,"And hath taken one of the Kings seede, and made a couenant with him, and hath taken an othe of him: he hath also taken the princes of the land,"
Ezekiel,17,14,"That the kingdome might be in subiection, and not lift it selfe vp, but keepe their couenant, and stand to it."
Ezekiel,17,15,"But he rebelled against him, and sent his ambassadours into Egypt, that they might giue him horses, and much people: shall hee prosper? shall he escape, that doeth such things? or shall he breake the couenant, and be deliuered?"
Ezekiel,17,16,"As I liue, saith the Lord God, he shall die in the middes of Babel, in the place of the King, that had made him King, whose othe he despised, and whose couenant made with him, he brake."
Ezekiel,17,17,"Neither shall Pharaoh with his mightie hoste, and great multitude of people, mainteine him in the warre, when they haue cast vp mounts, and builded ramparts to destroy many persons."
Ezekiel,17,18,"For he hath despised the othe, and broken ye couenant (yet lo, he had giuen his hand) because he hath done all these things, he shall not escape."
Ezekiel,17,19,"Therefore, thus sayth the Lord God, As I liue, I wil surely bring mine othe that he hath despised, and my couenant that he hath broken vpon his owne head."
Ezekiel,17,20,"And I wil spread my net vpon him, and he shalbe taken in my net, and I wil bring him to Babel, and will enter into iudgement with him there for his trespas that he hath committed against me."
Ezekiel,17,21,"And all that flee from him with all his hoste, shall fall by the sword, and they that remaine, shalbe scattered towarde all the windes: and ye shall know that I the Lord haue spoken it."
Ezekiel,17,22,"Thus saith the Lord God, I wil also take off the top of this hie cedar, and wil set it, and cut off the top of the tender plant thereof, and I wil plant it vpon an hie mountaine and great."
Ezekiel,17,23,"Euen in the hie mountaine of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughes and beare fruite, and be an excellent cedar, and vnder it shall remaine all birds, and euery foule shall dwell in the shadow of the branches thereof."
Ezekiel,17,24,"And all the trees of the fielde shall knowe that I the Lord haue brought downe the hie tree, and exalted the lowe tree, that I haue dried vp the greene tree, and made the drie tree to florish: I the Lord haue spoken it, and haue done it."
Ezekiel,18,1,"The worde of the Lord came vnto me againe, saying,"
Ezekiel,18,2,"What meane ye that ye speake this prouerbe, concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers haue eaten sowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge?"
Ezekiel,18,3,"As I liue, sayth the Lord God, ye shall vse this prouerbe no more in Israel."
Ezekiel,18,4,"Beholde, all soules are mine, both the soule of the father, and also the soule of the sonne are mine: the soule that sinneth, it shall die."
Ezekiel,18,5,"But if a man be iust, and doe that which is lawfull, and right,"
Ezekiel,18,6,"And hath not eaten vpon the mountaines, neither hath lift vp his eyes to the idoles of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbours wife, neither hath lyen with a menstruous woman,"
Ezekiel,18,7,"Neither hath oppressed any, but hath restored the pledge to his dettour: he that hath spoyled none by violence, but hath giuen his bread to the hungry, and hath couered the naked with a garment,"
Ezekiel,18,8,"And hath not giuen foorth vpon vsurie, neither hath taken any increase, but hath withdrawen his hand from iniquitie, and hath executed true iudgement betweene man and man,"
Ezekiel,18,9,"And hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my iudgements to deale truely, he is iust, he shall surely liue, sayth the Lord God."
Ezekiel,18,10,"If he beget a sonne, that is a thiefe, or a sheader of blood, if he do any one of these things,"
Ezekiel,18,11,"Though he doe not all these things, but either hath eaten vpon the mountaines, or defiled his neighbours wife,"
Ezekiel,18,12,"Or hath oppressed the poore and needy, or hath spoyled by violence, or hath not restored the pledge, or hath lift vp his eyes vnto the idoles, or hath committed abomination,"
Ezekiel,18,13,"Or hath giuen forth vpon vsurie, or hath taken increase, shall he liue? he shall not liue: seeing he hath done all these abominations, he shall die the death, and his blood shall be vpon him."
Ezekiel,18,14,"But if he beget a sonne, that seeth all his fathers sinnes, which he hath done, and feareth, neither doeth such like,"
Ezekiel,18,15,"That hath not eaten vpon the mountaines, neither hath lift vp his eyes to the idols of ye house of Israel, nor hath defiled his neighbours wife,"
Ezekiel,18,16,"Neither hath oppressed any, nor hath withholden the pledge, neither hath spoyled by violence, but hath giuen his bread to the hungry, and hath couered the naked with a garment,"
Ezekiel,18,17,"Neither hath withdrawen his hand from the afflicted, nor receiued vsurie nor increase, but hath executed my iudgements, and hath walked in my statutes, he shall not die in the iniquitie of his father, but he shall surely liue."
Ezekiel,18,18,"His father, because he cruelly oppressed and spoyled his brother by violence, and hath not done good among his people, loe, euen he dyeth in his iniquitie."
Ezekiel,18,19,"Yet say ye, Wherefore shall not the sonne beare the iniquitie of the father? because ye sonne hath executed iudgement and iustice, and hath kept all my statutes, and done them, he shall surely liue,"
Ezekiel,18,20,"The same soule that sinneth, shall die: the sonne shall not beare the iniquitie of the father, neither shall the father beare the iniquitie of the sonne, but the righteousnes of the righteous shall be vpon him, and the wickednesse of the wicked shall be vpon him selfe."
Ezekiel,18,21,"But if the wicked will returne from all his sinnes that he hath committed, and keepe all my statutes, and doe that which is lawfull and right, he shall surely liue, and shall not die."
Ezekiel,18,22,"All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned vnto him, but in his righteousnes that he hath done, he shall liue."
Ezekiel,18,23,"Haue I any desire that the wicked should die, sayth the Lord God? or shall he not liue, if he returne from his wayes?"
Ezekiel,18,24,"But if the righteous turne away from his righteousnes, and commit iniquitie, and doe according to all the abominations, that the wicked man doeth, shall he liue? all his righteousnes that he hath done, shall not be mentioned: but in his transgression that he hath committed, and in his sinne that he hath sinned, in them shall he die."
Ezekiel,18,25,"Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equall: heare now, O house of Israel. Is not my way equall? or are not your wayes vnequall?"
Ezekiel,18,26,"For when a righteous man turneth away from his righteousnes, and committeth iniquitie, he shall euen die for the same, he shall euen die for his iniquitie, that he hath done."
Ezekiel,18,27,"Againe when the wicked turneth away from his wickednes that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawfull and right, he shall saue his soule aliue."
Ezekiel,18,28,"Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that hee hath committed, he shall surely liue and shall not die."
Ezekiel,18,29,"Yet saith ye house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equall. O house of Israel, are not my wayes equall? or are not your wayes vnequall?"
Ezekiel,18,30,"Therefore I will iudge you, O house of Israel, euery one according to his wayes, sayth the Lord God: returne therefore and cause others to turne away from all your transgressions: so iniquitie shall not be your destruction."
Ezekiel,18,31,"Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye haue transgressed, and make you a newe heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?"
Ezekiel,18,32,"For I desire not the death of him that dyeth, sayth the Lord God: cause therefore one another to returne, and liue ye."
Ezekiel,19,1,"Thou also, take vp a lamentation for the princes of Israel,"
Ezekiel,19,2,"And say, Wherefore lay thy mother as a lyonesse among the lyons? she nourished her yong ones among the lyons whelps,"
Ezekiel,19,3,"And she brought vp one of her whelps, and it became a lyon, and it learned to catch the praye, and it deuoured men."
Ezekiel,19,4,"The nations also heard of him, and he was taken in their nets, and they brought him in chaines vnto the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,19,5,"Nowe when she sawe, that she had waited and her hope was lost, she tooke another of her whelps, and made him a lyon."
Ezekiel,19,6,"Which went among the lyons, and became a lyon, and learned to catch the praye, and he deuoured men."
Ezekiel,19,7,"And he knew their widowes, and he destroyed their cities, and the land was wasted, and all that was therein by the noyse of his roaring."
Ezekiel,19,8,"Then the nations set against him on euery side of the countreys, and laide their nets for him: so he was taken in their pit."
Ezekiel,19,9,"And they put him in prison and in chaines, and brought him to the King of Babel, and they put him in holdes, that his voyce should no more be heard vpon the mountaines of Israel."
Ezekiel,19,10,"Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she brought foorth fruite and branches by the abundant waters,"
Ezekiel,19,11,"And she had strong rods for the scepters of them that beare rule, and her stature was exalted among the branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches."
Ezekiel,19,12,"But she was plucked vp in wrath: she was cast downe to the ground, and the East winde dried vp her fruite: her branches were broken, and withered: as for the rod of her strength, the fire consumed it."
Ezekiel,19,13,And now she is planted in the wildernes in a drie and thirstie ground.
Ezekiel,19,14,"And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath deuoured her fruite, so that she hath no strong rod to be a scepter to rule: this is a lamentation and shalbe for a lamentation."
Ezekiel,20,1,"And in the seuenth yeere, in the fift moneth, the tenth day of the moneth, came certaine of the elders of Israel to enquire of the Lord, and sate before me."
Ezekiel,20,2,"Then came the worde of the Lord vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,20,3,"Sonne of man, speake vnto the Elders of Israel, and say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Are ye come to enquire of me? as I liue, sayth the Lord God, when I am asked, I wil not answer you."
Ezekiel,20,4,"Wilt thou iudge them, sonne of man? wilt thou iudge them? cause them to vnderstand the abominations of their fathers,"
Ezekiel,20,5,"And say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, In the day when I chose Israel, and lift vp mine hand vnto the seede of the house of Iaakob, and made my selfe knowen vnto them in the land of Egypt, when I lift vp mine hand vnto them, and sayd, I am the Lord your God,"
Ezekiel,20,6,"In the day that I lift vp mine hand vnto them to bring them forth of the land of Egypt, into a land that I had prouided for them, flowing with milke and hony which is pleasant among all lands,"
Ezekiel,20,7,"Then sayd I vnto them, Let euery man cast away the abominations of his eyes, and defile not your selues with the idols of Egypt: for I am the Lord your God."
Ezekiel,20,8,"But they rebelled against me, and would not heare me: for none cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idoles of Egypt: then I thought to powre out mine indignation vpon them, and to accomplish my wrath against them in the mids of the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,9,"But I had respect to my Name, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whome they were, and in whose sight I made my selfe knowen vnto them in bringing them forth of the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,10,"Nowe I caried them out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wildernes."
Ezekiel,20,11,"And I gaue them my statutes, and declared my iudgements vnto them, which if a man doe, he shall liue in them."
Ezekiel,20,12,"Moreouer I gaue them also my Sabbaths to be a signe betweene me and them, that they might knowe that I am the Lord, that sanctifie them."
Ezekiel,20,13,"But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wildernes: they walked not in my statutes, and they cast away my iudgements, which if a man doe, he shall liue in them, and my Sabbaths haue they greatly polluted: then I thought to powre out mine indignation vpon them in the wildernes to consume them,"
Ezekiel,20,14,"But I had respect to my Name, that it shoulde not bee polluted before the heathen in whose sight I brought them out."
Ezekiel,20,15,"Yet neuerthelesse, I lift vp mine hande vnto them in the wildernes that I would not bring them into the lande, which I had giuen them, flowing with milke and hony, which was pleasant aboue all landes,"
Ezekiel,20,16,"Because they cast away my iudgments, and walked not in my statutes, but haue polluted my Sabbaths: for their heart went after their idoles."
Ezekiel,20,17,"Neuerthelesse, mine eye spared them, that I would not destroye them, neither would I consume them in the wildernes."
Ezekiel,20,18,"But I said vnto their children in the wildernes, Walke ye not in the ordinances of your fathers, neither obserue their maners, nor defile your selues with their idoles."
Ezekiel,20,19,"I am the Lord your God: walke in my statutes, and keepe my iudgements and doe them,"
Ezekiel,20,20,"And sanctifie my Sabbaths, and they shall bee a signe betweene mee and you, that ye may knowe that I am the Lord your God."
Ezekiel,20,21,"Notwithstanding the children rebelled against mee: they walked not in my statutes, nor kept my iudgements to doe them, which if a man doe, hee shall liue in them, but they polluted my Sabbaths: then I thought to powre out mine indignation vpon them, and to accomplish my wrath against them in the wildernes."
Ezekiel,20,22,"Neuerthelesse I withdrew mine hand and had respect to my Name that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them foorth."
Ezekiel,20,23,"Yet I lift vp mine hande vnto them in the wildernes, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countreys,"
Ezekiel,20,24,"Because they had not executed my iudgements, but had cast away my statutes and had polluted my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers idoles."
Ezekiel,20,25,"Wherefore I gaue them also statutes that were not good, and iudgements, wherein they should not liue."
Ezekiel,20,26,"And I polluted them in their owne giftes in that they caused to passe by the fire all that first openeth ye wombe, that I might destroy them, to the ende, that they might know that I am ye Lord."
Ezekiel,20,27,"Therefore, sonne of man, speake vnto the house of Israel, and say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Yet in this your fathers haue blasphemed me, though they had before grieuously transgressed against me."
Ezekiel,20,28,"For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted vp mine hand to giue it to them, then they saw euery hie hill, and all the thicke trees, and they offred there their sacrifices, and there they presented their offering of prouocation: there also they made their sweete sauour, and powred out there their drinke offerings."
Ezekiel,20,29,"Then I saide vnto them, What is the hie place whereunto ye goe? And the name thereof was called Bamah vnto this day."
Ezekiel,20,30,"Wherefore, say vnto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, Are ye not polluted after the maner of your fathers? and commit ye not whoredome after their abominations?"
Ezekiel,20,31,"For when you offer your giftes, and make your sonnes to passe through the fire, you pollute your selues with all your idoles vnto this day: shall I answere you when I am asked, O house of Israel? As I liue, saith the Lord God, I wil not answere you when I am asked."
Ezekiel,20,32,"Neither shall that be done that commeth into your minde: for ye say, We wil be as the heathen, and as the families of the countreys, and serue wood, and stone."
Ezekiel,20,33,"As I liue, saith the Lord God, I will surely rule you with a mightie hand, and with a stretched out arme, and in my wrath powred out,"
Ezekiel,20,34,"And will bring you from the people, and will gather you out of the countreys, wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arme, and in my wrath powred out,"
Ezekiel,20,35,"And I will bring you into the wildernes of the people, and there wil I pleade with you face to face."
Ezekiel,20,36,"Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wildernes of the lande of Egypt, so will I pleade with you, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,20,37,"And I wil cause you to passe vnder the rod, and wil bring you into the bond of the couenant."
Ezekiel,20,38,"And I wil chuse out from among you the rebels, and them that transgresse against mee: I will bring them out of the land where they dwel, and they shall not enter into the lande of Israel, and you shall knowe that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,20,39,"As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord God, Goe you, and serue euery one his idole, seeing that ye will not obey me, and pollute mine holy Name no more with your giftes and with your idoles."
Ezekiel,20,40,"For in mine holy mountaine, euen in the hie mountaine of Israel, saith the Lord God, there shall all the house of Israel, and all in the lande, serue me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offrings and the first fruites of your oblations, with all your holy things."
Ezekiel,20,41,"I will accept your sweete sauour, when I bring you from the people, and gather you out of the countreys, wherein ye haue bene scattered, that I may be sanctified in you before ye heathen."
Ezekiel,20,42,"And ye shall knowe, that I am the Lord, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the land, for the which I lifted vp mine hande to giue it to your fathers."
Ezekiel,20,43,"And there shall ye remember your wayes, and all your workes, wherein ye haue bene defiled, and ye shall iudge your selues worthy to be cut off, for all your euils, that ye haue committed."
Ezekiel,20,44,"And ye shall knowe, that I am the Lord, when I haue respect vnto you for my Names sake, and not after your wicked wayes, nor according to your corrupt workes, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,20,45,"Moreouer, the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,20,46,"Sonne of man, set thy face toward the way of Teman, and drop thy word toward the South, and prophecie towarde the forest of the fielde of the South,"
Ezekiel,20,47,"And say to the forest of the South, Heare the worde of the Lord: thus saith the Lord God, Beholde, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall deuoure all the greene wood in thee, and all the drie wood: the continuall flame shall not bee quenched, and euery face from the South to the North shall be burnt therein."
Ezekiel,20,48,"And all flesh shall see, that I the Lord haue kindled it, and it shall not bee quenched. Then saide I, Ah Lord God, they say of me, Doeth not he speake parables?"
Ezekiel,21,1,"The word of ye Lord came to me againe, saying,"
Ezekiel,21,2,"Sonne of man, set thy face toward Ierusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophecie against the land of Israel."
Ezekiel,21,3,"And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the Lord, Beholde, I come against thee, and will drawe my sword out of his sheath, and cut off from thee both the righteous and the wicked."
Ezekiel,21,4,"Seeing then that I will cut off from thee both the righteous and wicked, therefore shall my sworde goe out of his sheath against all flesh from the South to the North,"
Ezekiel,21,5,"That all flesh may knowe that I the Lord haue drawen my sworde out of his sheath, and it shall not returne any more."
Ezekiel,21,6,"Mourne therefore, thou sonne of man, as in the paine of thy reines, and mourne bitterly before them."
Ezekiel,21,7,"And if they say vnto thee, Wherefore mournest thou? then answere, Because of the bruite: for it commeth, and euery heart shall melt, and all handes shall be weake, and all mindes shall faint, and all knees shall fall away as water: beholde, it commeth, and shall be done, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,21,8,"Againe, the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,21,9,"Sonne of man, prophecie, and say, Thus saith the Lord God, say, A sworde, a sworde both sharpe, and fourbished."
Ezekiel,21,10,"It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter, and it is fourbished that it may glitter: how shall we reioyce? for it contemneth the rod of my sonne, as all other trees."
Ezekiel,21,11,"And he hath giuen it to be fourbished, that he may handle it: this sword is sharpe, and is fourbished, that he may giue it into ye hand of the slayer."
Ezekiel,21,12,"Cry, and houle, sonne of man: for this shall come to my people, and it shall come vnto all the princes of Israel: the terrours of the sword shall be vpon my people: smite therefore vpon thy thigh."
Ezekiel,21,13,"For it is a triall, and what shall this be, if the sworde contemne euen the rodde? It shall be no more, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,21,14,"Thou therefore, sonne of man, prophecie, and smite hand to hand, and let the sworde be doubled: let the sworde that hath killed, returne the third time: it is the sword of the great slaughter entring into their priuie chambers."
Ezekiel,21,15,"I haue brought the feare of the sword into all their gates to make their heart to faint, and to multiplie their ruines. Ah it is made bright, and it is dressed for the slaughter."
Ezekiel,21,16,"Get thee alone: goe to the right hande, or get thy selfe to the left hande, whithersoeuer thy face turneth."
Ezekiel,21,17,"I wil also smite mine hands together, and wil cause my wrath to cease. I the Lord haue said it."
Ezekiel,21,18,"The worde of the Lord came vnto mee againe, saying,"
Ezekiel,21,19,"Also thou sonne of man, appoint thee two wayes, that the sworde of the King of Babel may come: both twaine shall come out of one lande, and chuse a place, and chuse it in the corner of the way of the citie."
Ezekiel,21,20,"Appoint a way, that the sworde may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Iudah in Ierusalem the strong citie."
Ezekiel,21,21,"And the King of Babel stoode at the parting of the way, at the head of the two wayes, consulting by diuination, and made his arrowes bright: hee consulted with idoles, and looked in the liuer."
Ezekiel,21,22,"At his right hand was the diuination for Ierusalem to appoint captaines, to open their mouth in the slaughter, and to lift vp their voyce with shouting, to laye engines of warre against the gates, to cast a mount, and to builde a fortresse."
Ezekiel,21,23,"And it shalbe vnto them as a false diuination in their sight for the othes made vnto them: but hee will call to remembrance their iniquitie, to the intent they should be taken."
Ezekiel,21,24,"Therefore thus sayeth the Lord God, Because ye haue made your iniquitie to bee remembred, in discouering your rebellion, that in al your workes your sinnes might appeare: because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand."
Ezekiel,21,25,"And thou prince of Israel polluted, and wicked, whose day is come, when iniquitie shall haue an ende,"
Ezekiel,21,26,"Thus saith the Lord God, I will take away the diademe, and take off the crowne: this shalbe no more the same: I wil exalt the humble, and will abase him that is hie."
Ezekiel,21,27,"I wil ouerturne, ouerturne, ouerturne it, and it shall be no more vntill he come, whose right it is, and I will giue it him."
Ezekiel,21,28,"And thou, sonne of man, prophecie, and say, Thus saith the Lord God to the children of Ammon, and to their blasphemie: say thou, I say, The sword, the sword is drawen foorth, and fourbished to the slaughter, to consume, because of the glittering:"
Ezekiel,21,29,"Whiles they see vanitie vnto thee, and prophecied a lie vnto thee to bring thee vpon the neckes of the wicked that are slaine, whose day is come when their iniquitie shall haue an ende."
Ezekiel,21,30,"Shall I cause it to returne into his sheath? I will iudge thee in the place where thou wast created, euen in the land of thine habitation."
Ezekiel,21,31,"And I wil powre out mine indignation vpon thee, and will blowe against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliuer thee into the hand of beastly men, and skilfull to destroy."
Ezekiel,21,32,"Thou shalt bee in the fire to be deuoured: thy blood shall be in the middes of the lande, and thou shalt be no more remembred: for I the Lord haue spoken it."
Ezekiel,22,1,"Moreover, the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,22,2,"Now thou sonne of man, wilt thou iudge, wilt thou iudge this bloody citie? wilt thou shew her all her abominations?"
Ezekiel,22,3,"Then say, Thus sayth the Lord God, The citie sheddeth blood in the middes of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against her selfe to pollute her selfe."
Ezekiel,22,4,"Thou hast offended in thy blood, that thou hast shed, and hast polluted thy selfe in thine idols, which thou hast made, and thou hast caused thy dayes to draw neere, and art come vnto thy terme: therefore haue I made thee a reproch to the heathen, and a mocking to all countreys."
Ezekiel,22,5,"Those that be neere, and those that be farre from thee, shall mocke thee, which art vile in name and sore in affliction."
Ezekiel,22,6,"Beholde, the princes of Israel euery one in thee was ready to his power, to shed blood."
Ezekiel,22,7,In thee haue they despised father and mother: in the middes of thee haue they oppressed the stranger: in thee haue they vexed the fatherlesse and the widowe.
Ezekiel,22,8,"Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast polluted my Sabbaths."
Ezekiel,22,9,In thee are men that cary tales to shed blood: in thee are they that eate vpon the mountaines: in ye mids of thee they comit abomination.
Ezekiel,22,10,In thee haue they discouered their fathers shame: in thee haue they vexed her that was polluted in her floures.
Ezekiel,22,11,"And euery one hath committed abomination with his neighbours wife, and euery one hath wickedly defiled his daughter in lawe, and in thee hath euery man forced his owne sister, euen his fathers daughter."
Ezekiel,22,12,"In thee haue they taken giftes to shed blood: thou hast taken vsurie and the encrease, and thou hast defrauded thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,22,13,"Beholde, therefore I haue smitten mine hands vpon thy couetousnesse, that thou hast vsed, and vpon the blood, which hath bene in the middes of thee."
Ezekiel,22,14,"Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the dayes that I shall haue to doe with thee? I the Lord haue spoken it, and will doe it."
Ezekiel,22,15,"And I wil scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countreys, and will cause thy filthines to cease from thee."
Ezekiel,22,16,"And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thy selfe in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt knowe that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,22,17,"And the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,22,18,"Sonne of man, the house of Israel is vnto me as drosse: all they are brasse, and tinne, and yron, and leade in the mids of the fornace: they are euen the drosse of siluer."
Ezekiel,22,19,"Therefore, thus sayth the Lord God, Because ye are all as drosse, beholde, therefore I will gather you in the middes of Ierusalem."
Ezekiel,22,20,"As they gather siluer and brasse, and yron, and leade, and tinne into the middes of the fornace, to blowe the fire vpon it to melt it, so wil I gather you in mine anger and in my wrath, and wil put you there and melt you."
Ezekiel,22,21,"I wil gather you, I say, and blowe the fire of my wrath vpon you, and you shalbe melted in the mids thereof."
Ezekiel,22,22,"As siluer is melted in the mids of the fornace, so shall ye be melted in the mids thereof, and ye shall knowe, that I the Lord haue powred out my wrath vpon you."
Ezekiel,22,23,"And the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,22,24,"Sonne of man, say vnto her; Thou art the land, that is vncleane, and not rained vpon in the day of wrath."
Ezekiel,22,25,"There is a conspiracie of her prophets in the mids thereof like a roaring lyon, rauening the praye: they haue deuoured soules: they haue taken the riches and precious things: they haue made her many widowes in the mids thereof."
Ezekiel,22,26,"Her Priests haue broken my Lawe, and haue defiled mine holy things: they haue put no difference betweene the holy and prophane, neither discerned betweene the vncleane, and the cleane, and haue hid their eyes from my Sabbaths, and I am prophaned among them."
Ezekiel,22,27,"Her princes in the mids thereof are like wolues, rauening the praye to shed blood, and to destroy soules for their owne couetous lucre."
Ezekiel,22,28,"And her prophets haue dawbed them with vntempered morter, seeing vanities, and diuining lies vnto them, saying, Thus sayth the Lord God, when the Lord had not spoken."
Ezekiel,22,29,"The people of the land haue violently oppressed by spoyling and robbing, and haue vexed the poore and the needy: yea, they haue oppressed the stranger against right."
Ezekiel,22,30,"And I sought for a man among them, that should make vp the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none."
Ezekiel,22,31,"Therefore haue I powred out mine indignation vpon them, and consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their owne wayes haue I rendred vpon their heads, sayth the Lord God."
Ezekiel,23,1,"The worde of the Lord came againe vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,23,2,"Sonne of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother."
Ezekiel,23,3,"And they committed fornication in Egypt, they committed fornication in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teates of their virginitie."
Ezekiel,23,4,"And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sonnes and daughters: thus were their names. Samaria is Aholah, and Ierusalem Aholibah."
Ezekiel,23,5,"And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine, and she was set on fire with her louers, to wit, with the Assyrians her neighbours,"
Ezekiel,23,6,"Which were clothed with blewe silke, both captaines and princes: they were all pleasant yong men, and horsemen riding vpon horses."
Ezekiel,23,7,"Thus she committed her whoredome with them, euen with all them that were the chosen men of Asshur, and with all on whome she doted, and defiled her selfe with all their idoles."
Ezekiel,23,8,"Neither left she her fornications, learned of the Egyptians: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginitie, and powred their whoredome vpon her."
Ezekiel,23,9,"Wherefore I deliuered her into the hands of her louers, euen into the hands of the Assyrians, vpon whome she doted."
Ezekiel,23,10,"These discouered her shame: they tooke away her sonnes and her daughters, and slewe her with the sworde, and she had an euill name among women: for they had executed iudgement vpon her."
Ezekiel,23,11,"And when her sister Aholibah sawe this, she marred her selfe with inordinate loue, more then she, and with her fornications more then her sister with her fornications."
Ezekiel,23,12,"She doted vpon the Assyrians her neighbours, both captaines and princes clothed with diuers sutes, horsemen ryding vpon horses: they were all pleasant yong men."
Ezekiel,23,13,"Then I sawe that she was defiled, and that they were both after one sort,"
Ezekiel,23,14,"And that she encreased her fornications: for when she sawe men painted vpon the wall, the images of the Caldeans painted with vermelon,"
Ezekiel,23,15,"And girded with girdles vpon their loynes, and with dyed attyre vpon their heads (looking all like princes after the maner of the Babylonians in Caldea, the land of their natiuitie)"
Ezekiel,23,16,"Assoone, I say, as she sawe them, she doted vpon them, and sent messengers vnto them into Caldea."
Ezekiel,23,17,"Nowe when the Babylonians came to her into the bed of loue, they defiled her with their fornication, and she was polluted with them, and her lust departed from them."
Ezekiel,23,18,"So she discouered her fornication, and disclosed her shame: then mine heart forsooke her, like as mine heart had forsaken her sister."
Ezekiel,23,19,"Yet she encreased her whoredome more, and called to remembrance ye dayes of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt."
Ezekiel,23,20,"For she doted vpon their seruants whose members are as the members of asses, and whose yssue is like the yssue of horses."
Ezekiel,23,21,"Thou calledst to remembrance the wickednes of thy youth, when thy teates were bruised by ye Egyptians: therefore ye paps of thy youth are thus."
Ezekiel,23,22,"Therefore, O Aholibah, thus sayeth the Lord God, Beholde, I will raise vp thy louers against thee, from whome thine heart is departed, and I will bring them against thee on euery side,"
Ezekiel,23,23,"To wit, the Babylonians, and all the Caldeans, Peked, and Shoah, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: they were all pleasant yong men, captaines and princes: all they were valiant and renoumed, riding vpon horses."
Ezekiel,23,24,"Euen these shall come against thee with charets, waggons, and wheeles, and with a multitude of people, which shall set against thee, buckler and shield, and helmet round about: and I will leaue the punishment vnto them, and they shall iudge thee according to their iudgements."
Ezekiel,23,25,"And I wil lay mine indignation vpon thee, and they shall deale cruelly with thee: they shall cut off thy nose and thine eares, and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall cary away thy sonnes and thy daughters, and thy residue shall be deuoured by the fire."
Ezekiel,23,26,"They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fayre iewels."
Ezekiel,23,27,"Thus wil I make thy wickednes to cease from thee and thy fornication out of the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift vp thine eyes vnto them, nor remember Egypt any more."
Ezekiel,23,28,"For thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I wil deliuer thee into the hand of them, whome thou hatest: euen into the hands of them from whome thine heart is departed."
Ezekiel,23,29,"And they shall handle thee despitefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leaue thee naked and bare, and the shame of thy fornications shalbe discouered, both thy wickednes, and thy whoredome."
Ezekiel,23,30,"I wil doe these things vnto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idoles."
Ezekiel,23,31,Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister: therefore wil I giue her cup into thine hand.
Ezekiel,23,32,"Thus saith ye Lord God, Thou shalt drinke of thy sisters cup, deepe and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorne and had in derision, because it containeth much."
Ezekiel,23,33,"Thou shalt be filled with drunkennes and sorow, euen with the cup of destruction, and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria."
Ezekiel,23,34,"Thou shalt euen drinke it, and wring it out to the dregges, and thou shalt breake the sheards thereof, and teare thine owne breasts: for I haue spoken it, sayth the Lord God."
Ezekiel,23,35,"Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behinde thy backe, therefore thou shalt also beare thy wickednes and thy whoredome."
Ezekiel,23,36,"The Lord sayd moreouer vnto me, Sonne of man, wilt thou iudge Aholah and Aholibah? and wilt thou declare to them their abominations?"
Ezekiel,23,37,"For they haue played the whores, and blood is in their hands, and with their idoles haue they committed adulterie, and haue also caused their sonnes, whome they bare vnto me, to passe by the fire to be their meate."
Ezekiel,23,38,"Moreouer, thus haue they done vnto me: they haue defiled my Sanctuarie in the same day, and haue prophaned my Sabbaths."
Ezekiel,23,39,"For when they had slaine their children to their idoles, they came the same day into my Sanctuarie to defile it: and loe, thus haue they done in the middes of mine house."
Ezekiel,23,40,"And howe much more is it that they sent for men to come from farre vnto whom a messenger was sent, and loe, they came? for whome thou diddest wash thy selfe, and paintedst thine eyes, and deckedst thee with ornaments,"
Ezekiel,23,41,"And satest vpon a costly bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oyle."
Ezekiel,23,42,"And a voyce of a multitude being at ease, was with her: and with the men to make the company great were brought men of Saba from the wildernes, which put bracelets vpon their hands, and beautifull crownes vpon their heads."
Ezekiel,23,43,"Then I sayd vnto her, that was olde in adulteries, Now shall she and her fornications come to an end."
Ezekiel,23,44,And they went in vnto her as they goe to a common harlot: so went they to Aholah and Aholibah the wicked women.
Ezekiel,23,45,"And ye righteous men they shall iudge them, after the maner of harlots, and after the maner of murtherers: for they are harlots, and blood is in their hands."
Ezekiel,23,46,"Wherefore thus sayth the Lord God, I will bring a multitude vpon them, and will giue them vnto the tumult, and to the spoyle,"
Ezekiel,23,47,"And the multitude shall stone them with stones, and cut them with their swordes: they shall slay their sonnes, and their daughters, and burne vp their houses with fire."
Ezekiel,23,48,"Thus will I cause wickednesse to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to doe after your wickednesse."
Ezekiel,23,49,"And they shall laye your wickednesse vpon you, and ye shall beare the sinnes of your idoles, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lord God."
Ezekiel,24,1,"Again in the ninth yeere, in the tenth moneth, in the tenth day of the moneth, came the worde of the Lord vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,24,2,"Sonne of man, write thee the name of the day, euen of this same day: for the King of Babel set himselfe against Ierusalem this same day."
Ezekiel,24,3,"Therefore speake a parable vnto the rebellious house, and say vnto them, Thus sayth the Lord God, Prepare a pot, prepare it, and also powre water into it."
Ezekiel,24,4,"Gather the pieces thereof into it, euen euery good piece, as the thigh and the shoulder, and fill it with the chiefe bones."
Ezekiel,24,5,"Take one of the best sheepe, and burne also the bones vnder it, and make it boyle well, and seethe the bones of it therein,"
Ezekiel,24,6,"Because the Lord God sayth thus, Woe to the bloody citie, euen to the pot, whose skomme is therein, and whose skomme is not gone out of it: bring it out piece by piece: let no lot fall vpon it."
Ezekiel,24,7,"For her blood is in the middes of her: shee set it vpon an high rocke, and powred it not vpon on the ground to couer it with dust,"
Ezekiel,24,8,"That it might cause wrath to arise, and take vengeance: euen I haue set her blood vpon an high rocke that it should not be couered."
Ezekiel,24,9,"Therefore thus saith ye Lord God, Woe to the bloody citie, for I will make ye burning great."
Ezekiel,24,10,"Heape on much wood: kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and cast in spice, and let the bones be burnt."
Ezekiel,24,11,"Then set it emptie vpon the coles thereof, that the brasse of it may be hot, and may burne, and that the filthinesse of it may be molten in it, and that the skomme of it may be consumed."
Ezekiel,24,12,"She hath wearied her selfe with lyes, and her great skomme went not out of her: therefore her skomme shall be consumed with fire."
Ezekiel,24,13,"Thou remainest in thy filthines and wickednes: because I would haue purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthines, till I haue caused my wrath to light vpon thee."
Ezekiel,24,14,"I the Lord haue spoken it: it shall come to passe, and I will doe it: I will not goe backe, neither will I spare, neither will I repent: according to thy wayes, and according to thy workes shall they iudge thee, sayeth the Lord God."
Ezekiel,24,15,"Also the worde of ye Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,24,16,"Sonne of man beholde, I take away from thee the pleasure of thine eyes with a plague: yet shalt thou neither mourne nor weepe, neither shall thy teares runne downe."
Ezekiel,24,17,"Cease from sighing: make no mourning for the dead, and binde the tyre of thine head vpon thee, and put on thy shooes vpon thy feete, and couer not thy lips, and eate not the bread of men."
Ezekiel,24,18,"So I spake vnto the people in the morning, and at euen my wife dyed: and I did in the morning, as I was commanded."
Ezekiel,24,19,"And the people said vnto me, Wilt thou not tell vs what these things meane towarde vs that thou doest so?"
Ezekiel,24,20,"Then I answered them, The worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,24,21,"Speake vnto the house of Israel, Thus sayth the Lord God, Behold, I will pollute my Sanctuarie, euen the pride of your power, the pleasure of your eyes, and your hearts desire, and your sonnes, and your daughters whom ye haue left, shall fall by the sworde."
Ezekiel,24,22,"And ye shall doe as I haue done: ye shall not couer your lippes, neither shall ye eate the bread of men."
Ezekiel,24,23,"And your tyre shalbe vpon your heads, and your shooes vpon your feete: ye shall not mourne nor weepe, but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourne one toward another."
Ezekiel,24,24,"Thus Ezekiel is vnto you a signe: according to all that he hath done, ye shall do: and when this commeth, ye shall know that I am the Lord God."
Ezekiel,24,25,"Also, thou sonne of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their power, ye ioy of their honor, ye pleasure of their eyes, and the desire of their heart, their sonnes and their daughters?"
Ezekiel,24,26,"That he that escapeth in that day, shall come vnto thee to tell thee that which hee hath heard with his eares?"
Ezekiel,24,27,"In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speake, and be no more dumme, and thou shalt be a signe vnto them, and they shall knowe that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,25,1,"The worde of the Lord came againe vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,25,2,"Sonne of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophecie against them,"
Ezekiel,25,3,"And say vnto the Ammonites, Heare the word of the Lord God, Thus saith the Lord God, Because thou saydest, Ha, ha, against my Sanctuarie, when it was polluted, and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate, and against the house of Iudah, when they went into captiuitie,"
Ezekiel,25,4,"Beholde, therefore I will deliuer thee to the men of the East for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eate thy fruite, and they shall drinke thy milke."
Ezekiel,25,5,"And I will make Rabbah a dwelling place for camels, and the Ammonites a sheepecote, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,25,6,"For thus saith the Lord God, Because thou hast clapped the hands, and stamped with the feete, and reioyced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel,"
Ezekiel,25,7,"Beholde, therefore I will stretche out mine hand vpon thee, and will deliuer thee to be spoyled of the heathen, and I will roote thee out from the people, and I will cause thee to be destroyed out of the countreys, and I will destroy thee, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,25,8,"Thus saith the Lord God, Because that Moab and Seir doe say, Beholde, the house of Iudah is like vnto all the heathen,"
Ezekiel,25,9,"Therefore, beholde, I will open the side of Moab, euen of the cities of his cities, I say, in his frontiers with the pleasant countrey, Beth-ieshimoth, Baal-meon, and Karia-thaim."
Ezekiel,25,10,"I will call the men of the East against the Ammonites, and will giue them in possession, so that the Ammonites shall no more be remembred among the nations,"
Ezekiel,25,11,"And I will execute iudgements vpon Moab, and they shall knowe that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,25,12,"Thus sayth the Lord God, Because that Edom hath done euill by taking vengeance vpon the house of Iudah, and hath committed great offence, and reuenged himselfe vpon them,"
Ezekiel,25,13,"Therefore thus saith the Lord God, I will also stretch out mine hand vpon Edom, and destroy man and beast out of it, and I will make it desolate from Teman, and they of Dedan shall fall by the sworde."
Ezekiel,25,14,"And I will execute my vengeance vpon Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they shall doe in Edom according to mine anger, and according to mine indignation, and they shall know my vengeance, sayth the Lord God."
Ezekiel,25,15,"Thus sayth the Lord God, Because the Philistims haue executed vengeance, and reuenged themselues with a despitefull heart, to destroy it for the olde hatred,"
Ezekiel,25,16,"Therefore thus sayth the Lord God, Behold, I will stretche out mine hand vpon the Philistims, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast."
Ezekiel,25,17,"And I will execute great vengeance vpon them with rebukes of mine indignation, and they shall knowe that I am the Lord, when I shall lay my vengeance vpon them."
Ezekiel,26,1,"And in the eleuenth yeere, in the first day of the moneth, the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,26,2,"Sonne of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Ierusalem, Aha, the gate of the people is broken: it is turned vnto me: for seeing she is desolate, I shall be replenished,"
Ezekiel,26,3,"Therefore thus sayth the Lord God, Beholde, I come against thee, O Tyrus, and I will bring vp many nations against thee, as the sea mounteth vp with his waues."
Ezekiel,26,4,"And they shall destroy the walles of Tyrus and breake downe her towres: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rocke."
Ezekiel,26,5,"Thou shalt be for the spreading of nettes in the middes of the sea: for I haue spoken it, sayth the Lord God, and it shalbe a spoile to ye nations."
Ezekiel,26,6,"And her daughters which are in the fielde, shall be slaine by the sworde, and they shall know that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,26,7,"For thus sayth the Lord God, Behold, I will bring vpon Tyrus Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babel, a King of Kings from the North, with horses and with charets, and with horsemen, with a multitude and much people."
Ezekiel,26,8,"He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the fielde, and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift vp the buckler against thee."
Ezekiel,26,9,"He shall set engins of warre before him against thy walles, and with his weapons breake downe thy towres."
Ezekiel,26,10,"The dust of his horses shall couer thee, for their multitude: thy walles shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheeles, and of the charets, when he shall enter into thy gates as into the entrie of a citie that is broken downe."
Ezekiel,26,11,"With the hooues of his horses shall he treade downe all thy streetes: he shall slay thy people by the sworde, and the pillars of thy strength shall fall downe to the ground."
Ezekiel,26,12,"And they shall robbe thy riches, and spoyle thy marchandise, and they shall breake downe thy walles, and destroy thy pleasant houses, and they shall cast thy stones and thy timber and thy dust into the middes of the water."
Ezekiel,26,13,"Thus will I cause the sounde of thy songs to cease, and the sound of thine harpes shall be no more heard."
Ezekiel,26,14,"I wil lay thee like the top of a rocke: thou shalt be for a spreading of nets: thou shalt be built no more: for I the Lord haue spoken it, sayth the Lord God."
Ezekiel,26,15,"Thus sayth the Lord God to Tyrus, Shall not the yles tremble at the sounde of thy fall? and at the crie of the wounded, when they shall be slaine and murthered in the middes of thee?"
Ezekiel,26,16,"Then all the princes of the sea shall come downe from their thrones: they shall lay away their robes, and put off their broydered garments, and shall clothe themselues with astonishment: they shall sitte vpon the ground, and be astonished at euery moment, and be amased at thee."
Ezekiel,26,17,"And they shall take vp a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, Howe art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of the sea men, the renoumed citie which was strong in the sea, both she and her inhabitants, which cause their feare to be on all that haunt therein!"

Ezekiel,32,32,"For I haue caused my feare to be in the lande of the liuing: and he shall be laid in the mids of the vncircumcised with them, that are slaine by the sword, euen Pharaoh and all his multitude, sayeth the Lord God."
Ezekiel,33,1,"Again, the woorde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,33,2,"Sonne of man, speake to the children of thy people, and say vnto them, When I bring the sworde vpon a lande, if the people of the lande take a man from among them, and make him their watchman,"
Ezekiel,33,3,"If when hee seeth the sworde come vpon ye land, he blow the trumpet, and warne the people,"
Ezekiel,33,4,"Then hee that heareth the sounde of the trumpet, and will not bee warned, if the sworde come, and take him away, his blood shall be vpon his owne head."
Ezekiel,33,5,"For he heard the sound of the trumpet, and woulde not bee admonished: therefore his blood shall be vpon him: but he that receiueth warning, shall saue his life."
Ezekiel,33,6,"But if the watchman see the sworde come, and blowe not the trumpet, and the people be not warned: if the sworde come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away for his iniquitie, but his blood will I require at the watchmans hande."
Ezekiel,33,7,"So thou, O sonne of man, I haue made thee a watchman vnto the house of Israel: therefore thou shalt heare the woorde at my mouth, and admonish them from me."
Ezekiel,33,8,"When I shall say vnto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt die the death, if thou doest not speake, and admonish the wicked of his way, that wicked man shall die for his iniquitie, but his blood will I require at thine hand."
Ezekiel,33,9,"Neuerthelesse, If thou warne the wicked of his way, to turne from it, if he doe not turne from his way, he shall die for his iniquitie, but thou hast deliuered thy soule."
Ezekiel,33,10,"Therefore, O thou sonne of man, speake vnto the house of Israel, Thus yee speake and say, If our transgressions and our sinnes bee vpon vs, and we are consumed because of them, howe should we then liue?"
Ezekiel,33,11,"Say vnto them, As I liue, sayeth the Lord God, I desire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turne from his way and liue: turne you, turne you from your euill waies, for why will ye die, O ye house of Israel?"
Ezekiel,33,12,"Therefore thou sonne of man, saye vnto the children of thy people, The righteousnesse of the righteous shall not deliuer him in the day of his transgression, nor the wickednesse of the wicked shall cause him to fall therein, in the day that he returneth from his wickednesse, neither shall the righteous liue for his righteousnesse in the day that he sinneth."
Ezekiel,33,13,"When I shall say vnto the righteous, that he shall surely liue, if he trust to his owne righteousnes, and commit iniquitie, all his righteousnes shall be no more remembred, but for his iniquitie that he hath committed, he shall die for the same."
Ezekiel,33,14,"Againe when I shall say vnto the wicked, thou shalt die the death, if he turne from his sinne, and doe that which is lawfull and right,"
Ezekiel,33,15,"To wit, if the wicked restore the pledge, and giue againe that he had robbed, and walke in the statutes of life, without committing iniquitie, he shall surely liue, and not die."
Ezekiel,33,16,"None of his sinnes that he hath comitted, shall be mentioned vnto him: because he hath done that, which is lawful, and right, he shall surely liue."
Ezekiel,33,17,"Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equall: but their owne way is vnequall."
Ezekiel,33,18,"When the righteous turneth from his righteousnesse, and committeth iniquitie, he shall euen die thereby."
Ezekiel,33,19,"But if the wicked returne from his wickednesse, and doe that which is lawfull and right, hee shall liue thereby."
Ezekiel,33,20,"Yet yee say, The way of the Lord is not equall. O ye house of Israel, I will iudge you euery one after his waies."
Ezekiel,33,21,"Also in the twelfth yere of our captiuitie, in the tenth moneth, and in the fift day of the moneth, one that had escaped out of Ierusalem, came vnto me, and said, The citie is smitten."
Ezekiel,33,22,"Now the hand of the Lord had bene vpon me in ye euening afore hee that had escaped, came, and had opened my mouth vntill he came to me in the morning: and when hee had opened my mouth, I was no more dumme."
Ezekiel,33,23,"Againe the worde of the Lord came vnto me, and saide,"
Ezekiel,33,24,"Sonne of man, these that dwel in the desolate places of the land of Israel, talke and say, Abraham was but one, and hee possessed the lande: but we are many, therefore the lande shall be giuen vs in possession."
Ezekiel,33,25,"Wherefore say vnto them, Thus saieth the Lord God, Ye eate with the blood, and lift vp your eyes towarde your idoles, and sheade blood: should ye then possesse the land?"
Ezekiel,33,26,"Ye leane vpon your swordes: ye worke abomination, and yee defile euery one his neighbours wife: should ye then possesse the land?"
Ezekiel,33,27,"Say thus vnto them, Thus saieth the Lord God, As I liue, so surely they that are in the desolate places, shall fall by the sword: and him that is in the open field, will I giue vnto the beasts to be deuoured: and they that be in the forts and in the caues, shall die of the pestilence."
Ezekiel,33,28,"For I will lay the land desolate and waste, and the pompe of her strength shall cease: and the moutaines of Israel shalbe desolate, and none shall passe through."
Ezekiel,33,29,"Then shall they know that I am the Lord, when I haue laid ye land desolate and wast, because of al their abominations, that they haue committed."
Ezekiel,33,30,"Also thou sonne of man, the children of thy people that talke of thee by the wals and in the dores of houses, and speake one to another, euery one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and heare what is the word that commeth from the Lord."
Ezekiel,33,31,"For they come vnto thee, as the people vseth to come: and my people sit before thee, and heare thy wordes, but they will not doe them: for with their mouthes they make iestes, and their heart goeth after their couetousnesse."
Ezekiel,33,32,"And loe, thou art vnto them, as a iesting song of one that hath a pleasant voyce, and can sing well: for they heare thy woordes, but they doe them not."
Ezekiel,33,33,"And when this commeth to passe (for loe, it will come) then shall they know, that a Prophet hath bene among them."
Ezekiel,34,1,"And the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,34,2,"Sonne of man, prophesie against the shepherdes of Israel, prophesie and say vnto them, Thus saieth the Lord God vnto the shepherds, Wo be vnto the shepherds of Israel, that feede them selues: should not the shepherds feede the flockes?"
Ezekiel,34,3,"Yee eate the fat, and yee clothe you with the wooll: yee kill them that are fed, but ye feede not the sheepe."
Ezekiel,34,4,"The weake haue ye not strengthened: the sicke haue ye not healed, neither haue ye bounde vp the broken, nor brought againe that which was driuen away, neither haue yee sought that which was lost, but with crueltie, and with rigour haue yee ruled them."
Ezekiel,34,5,"And they were scattered without a shepherde: and when they were dispersed, they were deuoured of all the beastes of the fielde."
Ezekiel,34,6,"My sheepe wandred through all the mountaines, and vpon euery hie hill: yea, my flocke was scattered through al the earth, and none did seeke or search after them."
Ezekiel,34,7,"Therefore ye shepherds, heare the woorde of the Lord."
Ezekiel,34,8,"As I liue, sayeth the Lord God, surely because my flocke was spoyled, and my sheepe were deuoured of all the beasts of the fielde, hauing no shepherde, neither did my shepherdes seeke my sheepe, but the shepherdes fedde them selues, and fedde not my sheepe,"
Ezekiel,34,9,"Therefore, heare ye the word of the Lord, O ye shepherds."
Ezekiel,34,10,"Thus saieth the Lord God, Behold, I come against the shepherds, and will require my sheepe at their hands, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheepe: neither shall the shepherds feede them selues any more: for I wil deliuer my sheepe from their mouthes, and they shall no more deuoure them."
Ezekiel,34,11,"For thus sayeth the Lord God, Beholde, I will search my sheepe, and seeke them out."
Ezekiel,34,12,"As a shepherd searcheth out his flocke, when he hath bene among his sheepe that are scattered, so wil I seeke out my sheepe and wil deliuer them out of all places, where they haue beene scattered in the cloudie and darke day,"
Ezekiel,34,13,"And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countreis, and will bring them to their owne lande, and feede them vpon the mountaines of Israel, by the riuers, and in all the inhabited places of the countrey."
Ezekiel,34,14,"I will feede them in a good pasture, and vpon the hie mountaines of Israel shall their folde be: there shall they lie in a good folde and in fat pasture shall they feede vpon the mountaines of Israel."
Ezekiel,34,15,"I will feede my sheepe, and bring them to their rest, sayth the Lord God."
Ezekiel,34,16,"I will seeke that which was lost, and bring againe that which was driue away, and will binde vp that which was broken, and will strengthen the weake but I wil destroy the fat and the strong, and I will feede them with iudgement."
Ezekiel,34,17,"Also you my sheepe, Thus saieth the Lord God, behold, I iudge betweene sheepe, and sheepe, betweene the rammes and the goates."
Ezekiel,34,18,"Seemeth it a small thing vnto you to haue eaten vp the good pasture, but yee must treade downe with your feete the residue of your pasture? and to haue drunke of the deepe waters, but yee must trouble the residue with your feete?"
Ezekiel,34,19,"And my sheepe eate that which yee haue troden with your feete, and drinke that which ye haue troubled with your feete."
Ezekiel,34,20,"Therefore thus sayth the Lord God vnto them, behold, I, euen I wil iudge betweene the fat sheepe and the leane sheepe."
Ezekiel,34,21,"Because ye haue thrust with side and with shoulder, and pusht al the weake with your hornes, till ye haue scattered them abroade,"
Ezekiel,34,22,"Therefore wil I helpe my sheepe, and they shall no more be spoyled, and I wil iudge betweene sheepe and sheepe."
Ezekiel,34,23,"And I wil set vp a shepherd ouer them, and he shall feede them, euen my seruant Dauid, he shall feede them, and he shalbe their shepherd."
Ezekiel,34,24,"And I the Lord will be their God, and my seruant Dauid shalbe the prince amog them. I the Lord haue spoken it."
Ezekiel,34,25,"And I will make with them a couenant of peace, and will cause the euil beastes to cease out of the land: and they shall dwel safely in the wildernesse, and sleepe in the woods."
Ezekiel,34,26,"And I wil set them, as a blessing, euen roud about my mountaine: and I will cause rayne to come downe in due season, and there shalbe raine of blessing."
Ezekiel,34,27,"And the tree of the fielde shall yeeld her fruite, and the earth shall giue her fruite, and they shalbe safe in their land, and shall know that I am the Lord, when I haue broken the cordes of their yoke, and deliuered them out of the hands of those that serued themselues of them."
Ezekiel,34,28,"And they shall no more be spoyled of the heathen, neither shall the beastes of the land deuoure them, but they shall dwell safely and none shall make them afrayd."
Ezekiel,34,29,"And I will rayse vp for them a plant of renoume, and they shalbe no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither beare the reproche of the heathen any more."
Ezekiel,34,30,"Thus shall they vnderstande, that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they, euen the house of Israel, are my people, sayth the Lord God."
Ezekiel,34,31,"And yee my sheepe, the sheepe of my pasture are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,35,1,"Moveover the worde of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,35,2,"Sonne of man, Set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesie against it,"
Ezekiel,35,3,"And say vnto it, Thus sayth the Lord God, Behold, O mount Seir, I come against thee, and I wil stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee desolate and waste."
Ezekiel,35,4,"I wil lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt knowe that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,35,5,"Because thou hast had a perpetuall hatred and hast put the children of Israel to flight by the force of the sword in the time of their calamitie, when their iniquitie had an ende,"
Ezekiel,35,6,"Therefore as I liue, sayth the Lord God, I wil prepare thee vnto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: except thou hate blood, euen blood shall pursue thee."
Ezekiel,35,7,"Thus will I make mount Seir desolate and waste, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth."
Ezekiel,35,8,"And I will fill his mountaines with his slayne men: in thine hilles, and in thy valleys and in all thy riuers shall they fall, that are slayne with the sworde."
Ezekiel,35,9,"I wil make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not returne, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,35,10,"Because thou hast said, These two nations, and these two countreys shalbe mine, and we wil possesse them (seeing the Lord was there)"
Ezekiel,35,11,"Therefore as I liue, sayth the Lord God, I wil euen do according to thy wrath, and according to thine indignation which thou hast vsed in thine hatred against them: and I wil make my selfe knowen among them whe I haue iudged thee."
Ezekiel,35,12,"And thou shalt know, that I the Lord haue heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountaines of Israel, saying, They lye waste, they are giuen vs to be deuoured."
Ezekiel,35,13,"Thus with your mouthes ye haue boasted against me, and haue multiplied your words against me: I haue heard them."
Ezekiel,35,14,"Thus sayth the Lord God, So shall all the world reioyce when I shall make thee desolate."
Ezekiel,35,15,"As thou diddest reioyce at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I doe vnto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea wholly, and they shall know, that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,36,1,"Also thou sonne of man, prophesie vnto the mountaines of Israel, and say, Ye mountaines of Israel, heare the word of the Lord."
Ezekiel,36,2,"Thus saith the Lord God, because the enemie hath sayde against you, Aha, euen the hye places of the world are ours in possession,"
Ezekiel,36,3,"Therefore prophesie, and say, Thus sayth the Lord God, Because that they haue made you desolate, and swallowed you vp on euery side, that ye might be a possession vnto the residue of the heathen, and ye are come vnto the lippes and tongues of men, and vnto the reproch of the people,"
Ezekiel,36,4,"Therefore ye mountaines of Israel, heare the worde of the Lord God, Thus sayth the Lord God to the mountaines and to the hilles, to the riuers, and to the valleys, and to the waste, and desolate places, and to the cities that are forsaken: which are spoyled and had in derision of the residue of the heathen that are round about."
Ezekiel,36,5,"Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Surely in the fire of mine indignation haue I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which haue taken my lande for their possession, with the ioy of all their heart, and with despitefull mindes to cast it out for a pray."
Ezekiel,36,6,"Prophesie therfore vpon the land of Israel, and say vnto the mountaines, and to the hilles, to the riuers, and to the valleys, Thus sayth the Lord God, Behold, I haue spoken in mine indignation, and in my wrath, because yee haue suffered the shame of the heathen,"
Ezekiel,36,7,"Therefore thus saith the Lord God, I haue lifted vp mine hand, surely the heathen that are about you, shall beare their shame."
Ezekiel,36,8,"But you, O mountaines of Israel, yee shall shoote forth your branches, and bring foorth your fruite to my people of Israel: for they are ready to come."
Ezekiel,36,9,"For behold, I come vnto you, and I wil turne vnto you, and ye shalbe tilled and sowen."
Ezekiel,36,10,"And I wil multiply the men vpon you, euen all the house of Israel wholly, and the cities shalbe inhabited, and the desolate places shalbe builded."
Ezekiel,36,11,"And I wil multiply vpon you man and beast, and they shall encrease, and bring fruite, and I will cause you to dwell after your olde estate, and I will bestowe benefites vpon you more then at the first, and ye shall know that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,36,12,"Yea, I wil cause men to walke vpon you, euen my people Israel, and they shall possesse you, and ye shalbe their inheritance, and ye shall no more henceforth depriue them of men."
Ezekiel,36,13,"Thus sayth the Lord God, because they say vnto you, Thou land deuourest vp men, and hast bene a waster of thy people,"
Ezekiel,36,14,"Therefore thou shalt deuoure men no more, neither waste thy people henceforth, sayth the Lord God,"
Ezekiel,36,15,"Neither will I cause men to heare in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou beare the reproche of the people any more, neither shalt cause thy folke to fal any more, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,36,16,"Moreouer the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,36,17,"Sonne of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their owne lande, they defiled it by their owne wayes, and by their deedes: their way was before me as the filthinesse of the menstruous."
Ezekiel,36,18,"Wherfore I powred my wrath vpon them, for the blood that they had shed in the land, and for their idoles, wherewith they had polluted it."
Ezekiel,36,19,"And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries for according to their wayes, and according to their deedes, I iudged them."
Ezekiel,36,20,"And when they entred vnto the heathen, whither they went, they polluted mine holy Name, when they sayd of them, These are the people of the Lord, and are gone out of his land."
Ezekiel,36,21,"But I fauoured mine holy Name which the house of Israel had polluted among the heathen, whither they went."
Ezekiel,36,22,"Therfore say vnto the house of Israel, Thus saith ye Lord God, I doe not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy Names sake, which yee polluted among the heathen whither ye went."
Ezekiel,36,23,"And I wil sanctifie my great Name, which was polluted among the heathen, among whome you haue polluted it, and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, sayth the Lord God, when I shalbe sanctified in you before their eyes."
Ezekiel,36,24,"For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your owne land."
Ezekiel,36,25,"Then wil I powre cleane water vpon you, and ye shalbe cleane: yea, from all your filthines, and from all your idoles wil I clense you."
Ezekiel,36,26,"A newe heart also will I giue you, and a new spirit wil I put within you, and I will take away the stonie heart out of your body, and I will giue you an heart of flesh."
Ezekiel,36,27,"And I will put my spirite within you, and cause you to walke in my statutes, and ye shall keepe my iudgements and do them."
Ezekiel,36,28,"And ye shall dwell in the land, that I gaue to your fathers, and ye shalbe my people, and I will be your God."
Ezekiel,36,29,"I will also deliuer you from all your filthinesse, and I will call for corne, and will increase it, and lay no famine vpon you."
Ezekiel,36,30,"For I will multiplie the fruite of the trees, and the increase of the fielde, that ye shall beare no more the reproch of famine among the heathen."
Ezekiel,36,31,"Then shall ye remember your owne wicked wayes, and your deedes that were not good, and shall iudge your selues worthie to haue bene destroyed for your iniquities, and for your abominations."
Ezekiel,36,32,"Be it knowen vnto you that I do not this for your sakes, sayth the Lord God: therefore, O ye house of Israel, be ashamed, and confounded for your owne wayes."
Ezekiel,36,33,"Thus sayth the Lord God, What time as I shall haue clensed you from all your iniquities, I will cause you to dwel in the cities, and the desolate places shalbe builded."
Ezekiel,36,34,"And the desolate land shalbe tilled, whereas it lay waste in the sight of all that passed by."
Ezekiel,36,35,"For they sayd, This waste land was like the garden of Eden, and these waste and desolate and ruinous cities were strong, and were inhabited."
Ezekiel,36,36,"Then the residue of the heathen that are left round about you, shall know that I the Lord builde the ruinous places, and plant the desolate places: I the Lord haue spoken it, and wil do it."
Ezekiel,36,37,"Thus saith the Lord God, I will yet for this be sought of ye house of Israel, to performe it vnto them: I wil encrease them with men like a flocke."
Ezekiel,36,38,"As the holy flocke, as the flocke of Ierusalem in their solemne feastes, so shall the desolate cities be filled with flockes of men, and they shall know, that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,37,1,"The hand of the Lord was vpon me, and caryed me out in ye spirit of ye Lord, and set me downe in ye mids of the field, which was full of bones."
Ezekiel,37,2,"And he led me round about by them, and beholde, they were very many in the open fielde, and lo, they were very drie."
Ezekiel,37,3,"And he sayde vnto me, Sonne of man, can these bones liue? And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest."
Ezekiel,37,4,"Againe he sayde vnto me, Prophecie vpon these bones and say vnto them, O ye dry bones, heare the word of the Lord."
Ezekiel,37,5,"Thus saith the Lord God vnto these bones, Behold, I wil cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall liue."
Ezekiel,37,6,"And I will lay sinewes vpon you, and make flesh growe vpon you, and couer you with skinne, and put breath in you, that ye may liue, and yee shall know that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,37,7,"So I prophecied, as I was commanded: and as I prophecied, there was a noyse, and beholde, there was a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone."
Ezekiel,37,8,"And when I beheld, loe, the sinewes, and the flesh grewe vpon them, and aboue, the skinne couered them, but there was no breath in them."
Ezekiel,37,9,"Then sayd he vnto me, Prophecie vnto the winde: prophecie, sonne of man, and say to the winde, Thus sayth the Lord God, Come from the foure windes, O breath, and breathe vpon these slayne, that they may liue."
Ezekiel,37,10,"So I prophecied as hee had commanded me: and the breath came into them, and they liued, and stood vp vpon their feete, an exceeding great armie."
Ezekiel,37,11,"Then he sayd vnto me, Sonne of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is gone, and we are cleane cut off."
Ezekiel,37,12,"Therefore prophecie, and say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Beholde, my people, I will open your graues, and cause you to come vp out of your sepulchres, and bring you into the lande of Israel,"
Ezekiel,37,13,"And yee shall knowe that I am the Lord, when I haue opened your graues, O my people, and brought you vp out of your sepulchres,"
Ezekiel,37,14,"And shall put my Spirit in you, and ye shall liue, and I shall place you in your owne land: then yee shall knowe that I the Lord haue spoken it, and performed it, sayth the Lord."
Ezekiel,37,15,"The word of the Lord came againe vnto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,37,16,"Moreouer thou sonne of man, take thee a piece of wood, and write vpon it, Vnto Iudah, and to the children of Israel his companions the take another piece of wood, and write vpon it, Vnto Ioseph the tree of Ephraim, and to al the house of Israel his companions."
Ezekiel,37,17,"And thou shalt ioyne the one to another into one tree, and they shalbe as one in thine hand."
Ezekiel,37,18,"And when the children of thy people shall speake vnto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shewe vs what thou meanest by these?"
Ezekiel,37,19,"Thou shalt answere them, Thus sayeth the Lord God, Behold, I wil take the tree of Ioseph, which is in the hande of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellowes, and will put them with him, euen with the tree of Iudah, and make them one tree, and they shalbe one in mine hand."
Ezekiel,37,20,"And the pieces of wood, whereon thou writest, shalbe in thine hand, in their sight."
Ezekiel,37,21,"And say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Beholde, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and wil gather them on euery side, and bring them into their owne land."
Ezekiel,37,22,"And I will make them one people in the lande, vpon the mountaines of Israel, and one king shalbe king to them all: and they shalbe no more two peoples, neither bee deuided any more henceforth into two kingdomes."
Ezekiel,37,23,"Neither shall they bee polluted any more with their idoles, nor with their abominations, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will saue them out of all their dwelling places, wherein they haue sinned, and will clense them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God."
Ezekiel,37,24,"And Dauid my seruant shalbe king ouer them, and they all shall haue one shepheard: they shall also walke in my iudgements, and obserue my statutes, and doe them."
Ezekiel,37,25,"And they shall dwell in the lande, that I haue giuen vnto Iaakob my seruant, where your fathers haue dwelt, and they shall dwel therein, euen they, and their sonnes, and their sonnes sonnes for euer, and my seruant Dauid shall bee their prince for euer."
Ezekiel,37,26,"Moreouer, I will make a couenant of peace with them: it shall be an euerlasting couenant with them, and I wil place them, and multiply them, and wil set my Sanctuarie among them for euermore."
Ezekiel,37,27,"My tabernacle also shalbe with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shalbe my people."
Ezekiel,37,28,"Thus the heathen shall knowe, that I the Lord do sanctifie Israel, when my Sanctuarie shall be among them for euermore."
Ezekiel,38,1,"And the worde of the Lord came vnto mee, saying,"
Ezekiel,38,2,"Sonne of man, set thy face against Gog, and against the lande of Magog, the chiefe prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophecie against him,"
Ezekiel,38,3,"And say, Thus sayth the Lord God, Behold, I come against thee, O Gog the chiefe prince of Meshech and Tubal."
Ezekiel,38,4,"And I wil destroy thee, and put hookes in thy chawes, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine host both horses, and horsemen, all clothed with al sorts of armour, eue a great multitude with bucklers, and shieldes, all handling swords."
Ezekiel,38,5,"They of Paras, of Cush, and Phut with the, euen all they that beare shielde and helmet."
Ezekiel,38,6,"Gomer and all his bands, and the house of Togarmah of the North quarters, and al his bands, and much people with thee."
Ezekiel,38,7,"Prepare thy selfe, and make thee ready, both thou, and al thy multitude, that are assembled vnto thee, and be thou their sauegard."
Ezekiel,38,8,"After many dayes thou shalt bee visited: for in the latter yeres thou shalt come into the land, that hath bene destroyed with the sworde, and is gathered out of many people vpon the mountaines of Israel, which haue long lien waste: yet they haue bene brought out of the people, and they shall dwell all safe."
Ezekiel,38,9,"Thou shalt ascende and come vp like a tempest, and shalt be like a cloude to couer the land, both thou, and all thy bandes, and many people with thee."
Ezekiel,38,10,"Thus saith the Lord God, Euen at ye same time shall many things come into thy minde, and thou shalt thinke euil thoughts."
Ezekiel,38,11,"And thou shalt say, I wil go vp to the land that hath no walled towres: I will goe to them that are at rest, and dwell in safetie, which dwell all without walles, and haue neither barres nor gates,"
Ezekiel,38,12,"Thinking to spoyle the pray, and to take a bootie, to turne thine hande vpon the desolate places that are nowe inhabited, and vpon the people, that are gathered out of the nations which haue gotten cattell and goods, and dwell in the middes of the land."
Ezekiel,38,13,"Sheba and Dedan, and the marchantes of Tarshish with all the lions thereof shall say vnto thee, Art thou come to spoyle the praye? hast thou gathered thy multitude to take a booty? to cary away siluer and golde, to take away cattell and goods, and to spoyle a great pray?"
Ezekiel,38,14,"Therefore, sonne of man, prophecie, and saye vnto Gog, Thus sayeth the Lord God, In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safe, shalt thou not knowe it?"

Ezekiel,38,16,"And thou shalt come vp against my people of Israel, as a cloude to couer the land: thou shalt be in the latter dayes, and I will bring thee vpon my lande, that the heathen may knowe mee, when I shalbe sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes."
Ezekiel,38,17,"Thus saith the Lord God, Art not thou he, of whom I haue spoken in olde time, by ye hand of my seruants the Prophets of Israel which prophecied in those dayes and yeeres, that I woulde bring thee vpon them?"
Ezekiel,38,18,"At the same time also whe Gog shall come against the land of Israel, sayth the Lord God, my wrath shall arise in mine anger."
Ezekiel,38,19,"For in mine indignation and in the fire of my wrath haue I spoken it: surely at that time there shalbe a great shaking in the land of Israel,"
Ezekiel,38,20,"So that the fishes of the sea, and the foules of the heauen, and the beasts of the field and al that moue and creepe vpon the earth, and al ye men that are vpon the earth, shall tremble at my presence, and the mountaines shalbe ouerthrowen, and the staires shall fall, and euery wall shall fall to the ground."
Ezekiel,38,21,"For I will call for a sworde against him throughout all my mountaines, saith the Lord God: euery mans sword shalbe against his brother."
Ezekiel,38,22,"And I will pleade against him with pestilence, and with blood, and I will cause to raine vpon him and vpon his bands, and vpon the great people, that are with him, a sore raine, and hailestones, fire, and brimstone."

Ezekiel,39,3,"And I will smite thy bowe out of thy left hand, and I will cause thine arrowes to fall out of thy right hand."
Ezekiel,39,4,"Thou shalt fal vpon the mountaines of Israel, and all thy bands and the people, that is with thee: for I will giue thee vnto the birdes and to euery feathered foule and beast of the fielde to be deuoured."
Ezekiel,39,5,"Thou shalt fall vpon the open fielde: for I haue spoken it, sayth the Lord God."
Ezekiel,39,6,"And I will sende a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell safely in the yles, and they shall knowe that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,39,7,"So will I make mine holy Name knowen in the middes of my people Israel, and I will not suffer them to pollute mine holy Name any more, and the heathen shall knowe that I am the Lord, the holy one of Israel."
Ezekiel,39,8,"Beholde, it is come, and it is done, sayeth the Lord God: and this is the day whereof I haue spoken."
Ezekiel,39,9,"And they that dwell in the cities of Israel, shall goe forth, and shall burne and set fire vpon the weapons, and on the shieldes, and bucklers, vpon the bowes, and vpon the arrowes, and vpon the staues in their handes, and vpon the speares, and they shall burne them with fire seuen yeeres."
Ezekiel,39,10,"So that they shall bring no wood out of the fielde, neither cut downe any out of the forestes: for they shall burne the weapons with fire, and they shall robbe those that robbed them, and spoyle those that spoyled them, sayeth the Lord God."
Ezekiel,39,11,"And at the same time will I giue vnto Gog a place there for burial in Israel, euen the valley whereby men go towarde the East part of the sea: and it shall cause them that passe by, to stoppe their noses, and there shall they bury Gog with all his multitude: and they shall call it the valley of Hamon-Gog."
Ezekiel,39,12,"And seuen moneths long shall the house of Israel be burying of the, that they may clense the land."
Ezekiel,39,13,"Yea, all the people of the lande shall burie them, and they shall haue a name when I shall be glorified, saith the Lord God."
Ezekiel,39,14,"And they shall chuse out men to goe continually through the lande with them that trauaile, to bury those that remaine vpon ye ground, and clense it: they shall search to the ende of seuen moneths."
Ezekiel,39,15,"And the trauailers that passe through the land, if any see a mans bone, then shall he set vp a signe by it, till the buriers haue buried it, in the valley of Hamon-Gog."
Ezekiel,39,16,And also the name of the citie shalbe Hamonah: thus shall they clense the land.
Ezekiel,39,17,"And thou sonne of man, thus sayeth the Lord God, Speake vnto euery feathered foule, and to all the beastes of the fielde, Assemble your selues, and come gather your selues on euery side to my sacrifice: for I do sacrifice a great sacrifice for you vpon the mountaines of Israel, that ye may eate flesh, and drinke blood."
Ezekiel,39,18,"Ye shall eate the flesh of the valiant, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of the weathers, of the lambes, and of the goates, and of bullockes, euen of all fat beastes of Bashan."
Ezekiel,39,19,"And ye shall eate fat till you be full, and drinke blood, till ye be drunken of my sacrifice, which I haue sacrificed for you."
Ezekiel,39,20,"Thus you shalbe filled at my table with horses and chariots, with valiant men, and with al men of warre, sayth the Lord God."
Ezekiel,39,21,"And I wil set my glory among the heathe, and all the heathen shall see my iudgement, that I haue executed, and mine hand, which I haue layed vpon them."
Ezekiel,39,22,"So the house of Israel shall knowe, that I am the Lord their God from that day and so forth."
Ezekiel,39,23,"And the heathen shall knowe, that ye house of Israel went into captiuitie for their iniquitie, because they trespassed against me: therefore hid I my face from them, and gaue them into ye hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword."
Ezekiel,39,24,"According to their vncleannes, and according to their transgressions haue I done vnto the, and hid my face from them."
Ezekiel,39,25,"Therefore thus sayth the Lord God, Nowe will I bring againe the captiuitie of Iaakob, and haue compassion vpon the whole house of Israel, and wil be ielous for mine holy Name,"
Ezekiel,39,26,"After that they haue borne their shame, and all their transgression, whereby they haue transgressed against me, whe they dwelt safely in their land, and without feare of any."
Ezekiel,39,27,"When I haue brought them againe from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies landes, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations,"
Ezekiel,39,28,"Then shall they know, that I am the Lord their God, which caused them to be led into captiuitie among the heathen: but I haue gathered them vnto their owne land, and haue left none of them any more there,"
Ezekiel,39,29,"Neither wil I hide my face any more from them: for I haue powred out my Spirit vpon the house of Israel, sayth the Lord God."
Ezekiel,40,1,"In the fiue and twentieth yeere of our being in captiuitie, in the beginning of the yeere, in the tenth day of the moneth, in the fourteenth yeere after that the citie was smitten, in the selfe same day, the hande of the Lord was vpon mee, and brought me thither."
Ezekiel,40,2,"Into the lande of Israel brought he me by a diuine vision, and set me vpon a very hie mountaine, whereupon was as the building of a citie, toward the South."
Ezekiel,40,3,"And he brought me thither, and beholde, there was a man, whose similitude was to looke to, like brasse, with a linnen thread in his hand, and a reede to measure with: and he stoode at the gate."
Ezekiel,40,4,"And the man said vnto me, Sonne of man, beholde with thine eyes, and heare with thine eares, and set thine heart vpon all that I shall shew thee: for to the intent, that they might be shewed thee, art thou brought hither: declare al that thou seest, vnto the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,40,5,"And beholde, I sawe a wall on the outside of the house round about: and in the mans hand was a reede to measure with, of sixe cubites long, by the cubite, and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the buylding with one reede, and the height with one reede."
Ezekiel,40,6,"Then came he vnto the gate, which looketh towarde the East, and went vp the stayres thereof, and measured the poste of the gate, which was one reede broade, and the other poste of the gate, which was one reede broade."
Ezekiel,40,7,"And euery chamber was one reede long, and one reede broad, and betweene the chambers were fiue cubites: and the post of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reede."
Ezekiel,40,8,He measured also the porche of the gate within with one reede.
Ezekiel,40,9,"Then measured he the porch of the gate of eight cubites, and the postes thereof, of two cubites, and the porch of the gate was inward."
Ezekiel,40,10,"And the chambers of the gate Eastwarde, were three on this side, and three on that side: they three were of one measure, and the postes had one measure on this side, and one on that side."
Ezekiel,40,11,"And he measured the breadth of the entrie of the gate ten cubites, and the height of the gate thirteene cubites."
Ezekiel,40,12,"The space also before the chambers was one cubite on this side, and the space was one cubite on that side, and the chambers were sixe cubites on this side and sixe cubites on that side."
Ezekiel,40,13,"He measured then the gate from the roufe of a chamber to the toppe of the gate: the breadth was fiue and twentie cubites, doore against doore."
Ezekiel,40,14,"He made also postes of threescore cubites, and the postes of the court, and of the gate had one measure round about."
Ezekiel,40,15,And vpon the forefront of the entry of the gate vnto the forefront of the porch of the gate within were fiftie cubites.
Ezekiel,40,16,"And there were narrowe windowes in the chambers, and in their postes within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and the windowes went rounde about within: and vpon the postes were palme trees."
Ezekiel,40,17,"Then brought he me into the outwarde court, and lo, there were chambers, and a pauement made for the court round about, and thirtie chambers were vpon the pauement."
Ezekiel,40,18,"And the pauement was by the side of the gates ouer against the length of the gates, and the pauement was beneath."
Ezekiel,40,19,"Then hee measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate without, vnto the forefront of the court within, an hundreth cubits Eastward and Northward."
Ezekiel,40,20,"And the gate of the outwarde court, that looked toward the North, measured he after the length and breadth thereof."
Ezekiel,40,21,"And the chambers thereof were, three on this side, and three on that side, and the postes thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fiftie cubites, and the breadth fiue and twentie cubites."
Ezekiel,40,22,"And their windowes, and their arches with their palme trees, were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the East, and the going vp vnto it had seuen steppes, and the arches therof were before them."
Ezekiel,40,23,"And the gate of the inner court stoode ouer against the gate towarde the North, and towarde the East, and hee measured from gate to gate an hundreth cubites."
Ezekiel,40,24,"After that, he brought mee towarde the South, and loe, there was a gate towarde the South, and hee measured the postes thereof, and the arches thereof according to these measures."
Ezekiel,40,25,"And there were windowes in it, and in the arches thereof round about, like those windowes: the height was fiftie cubites, and the breadth fiue and twentie cubites."
Ezekiel,40,26,"And there were seuen steps to go vp to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palme trees, one on this side, and another on that side vpon the post thereof."
Ezekiel,40,27,"And there was a gate in the inner court towarde the South, and he measured from gate to gate towarde the South an hundreth cubites."
Ezekiel,40,28,"And he brought me into the inner court by the South gate, and he measured the South gate according to these measures,"
Ezekiel,40,29,"And the chambers thereof, and the postes thereof, and the arches thereof according to these measures, and there were windowes in it, and in the arches thereof rounde about, it was fiftie cubites long and fiue and twentie cubites broade."
Ezekiel,40,30,"And the arches round about were fiue and twenty cubites long, and fiue cubites broad."
Ezekiel,40,31,"And the arches thereof were towarde the vtter court, and palme trees were vpon the postes thereof, and the going vp to it had eight steppes."
Ezekiel,40,32,"Againe he brought me into ye inner court toward the East, and he measured the gate according to these measures."
Ezekiel,40,33,"And the chambers thereof, and the postes thereof, and the arches thereof were according to these measures, and there were windowes therein, and in the arches thereof round about, it was fiftie cubites long, and fiue and twentie cubites broade."
Ezekiel,40,34,"And the arches thereof were towarde the vtter court, and palme trees were vpon the postes thereof, on this side and on that side, and the going vp to it had eight steppes."
Ezekiel,40,35,"After he brought mee to the North gate, and measured it, according to these measures,"
Ezekiel,40,36,"The chambers thereof, the postes thereof, and the arches thereof, and there were windowes therein round about: the height was fiftie cubits, and the breadth fiue and twentie cubites."
Ezekiel,40,37,"And the postes thereof were towarde the vtter court, and palme trees were vpon the postes thereof on this side, and on that side, and the going vp to it had eight steps."
Ezekiel,40,38,"And euery chamber, and the entrie thereof was vnder the postes of the gates: there they washed the burnt offring."
Ezekiel,40,39,"And in the porch of the gate stoode two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, vpon the which they slew the burnt offring, and the sinne offring, and the trespas offring."
Ezekiel,40,40,"And at the side beyond the steppes, at the entry of the North gate stoode two tables, and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate were two tables."
Ezekiel,40,41,"Foure tables were on this side, and foure tables on that side by the side of the gate, euen eight tables whereupon they slew their sacrifice."
Ezekiel,40,42,"And the foure tables were of hewen stone for the burnt offering, of a cubite and an halfe long, and a cubite and an halfe broade, and one cubite hie: whereupon also they layde the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offring and the sacrifice."
Ezekiel,40,43,"And within were borders an hand broade, fastened round about, and vpon the tables lay the flesh of the offring."
Ezekiel,40,44,"And without the inner gate were ye chambers of the singers in the inner Court, which was at the side of the North gate: and their prospect was towarde the South, and one was at the side of the East gate, hauing the prospect towarde the North."
Ezekiel,40,45,"And he said vnto me, This chamber whose prospect is towarde the South, is for the Priestes that haue the charge to keepe the house."
Ezekiel,40,46,"And the chamber whose prospect is toward the North, is for the Priestes that haue the charge to keepe the altar: these are the sonnes of Zadok among ye sonnes of Leui which may come neere to the Lord to minister vnto him."
Ezekiel,40,47,"So he measured the court, an hundreth cubites long, and an hundreth cubits broad, eue foure square: likewise the altar that was before ye house."
Ezekiel,40,48,"And hee brought mee to the porch of the house, and measured the postes of the porch, fiue cubites on this side, and fiue cubites on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubites on this side, and three cubites on that side."
Ezekiel,40,49,"The length of the porch was twentie cubites, and ye breadth eleuen cubites, and he brought me by the steps whereby they went vp to it, and there were pillars by the postes, one on this side, and another on that side."
Ezekiel,41,1,"Afterward, hee brought mee to the Temple, and measured the postes, sixe cubites broade on the one side, and sixe cubites broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the Tabernacle."
Ezekiel,41,2,"And the breadth of the entrie was tenne cubites, and the sides of the entrie were fiue cubites on the one side, and fiue cubites on the other side, and hee measured the length thereof fourtie cubites, and the breadth twentie cubites."
Ezekiel,41,3,"Then went hee in, and measured the postes of the entrie two cubites, and the entrie sixe cubites, and the breadth of the entrie seuen cubites."
Ezekiel,41,4,"So he measured the length thereof twentie cubites, and the breadth twentie cubites before the Temple. And he sayde vnto mee, This is the most holy place."
Ezekiel,41,5,"After, he measured the wall of the house, sixe cubites, and the breadth of euery chamber foure cubites rounde about the house, on euery side."
Ezekiel,41,6,"And the chambers were chamber vpon chaber, three and thirtie foote high, and they entred into the wall made for the chambers which was round about the house, that the postes might bee fastened therein, and not be fastened in the wall of the house."
Ezekiel,41,7,"And it was large and went rounde mounting vpwarde to the chambers: for the staire of the house was mounting vpwarde, rounde about the house: therefore the house was larger vpward: so they went vp from the lowest chamber to the highest by the middes."
Ezekiel,41,8,I sawe also the house hie rounde about: the foundations of the chambers were a full reede of fixe great cubites.
Ezekiel,41,9,"The thickenesse of the wall which was for the chamber without, was fiue cubites, and that which remained, was the place of the chambers that were within."
Ezekiel,41,10,And betweene the chambers was the widenes of twentie cubites round about the House on euery side.
Ezekiel,41,11,"And the doores of the chambers were toward the place that remained, one doore toward the North, and another doore toward the South, and the breadth of the place that remained, was fiue cubites round about."
Ezekiel,41,12,"Nowe the building that was before the separate place toward the West corner, was seuentie cubites broad, and the wall of the building was fiue cubites thick, round about, and ye length ninetie cubites."
Ezekiel,41,13,"So he measured the house an hundreth cubites long, and the separate place and the building with the walles thereof were an hundreth cubites long."
Ezekiel,41,14,"Also the breadth of the forefront of the house and of the separate place towarde the East, was an hundreth cubites."
Ezekiel,41,15,"And hee measured the length of the building, ouer against the separate place, which was behinde it, and the chambers on the one side and on the other side an hundreth cubites with the Temple within, and the arches of the court."
Ezekiel,41,16,"The postes and the narowe windowes, and the chambers round about, on three sides ouer against the postes, sieled with cedar wood rounde about, and from the ground vp to the windowes, and the windowes were sieled."
Ezekiel,41,17,"And from aboue the doore vnto the inner house and without, and by all the wall rounde about within and without it was sieled according to the measure."
Ezekiel,41,18,"And it was made with Cherubims and palme trees, so that a palme tree was betweene a Cherub and a Cherub: and euery Cherub had two faces."
Ezekiel,41,19,"So that the face of a man was towarde the palme tree on the one side, and the face of a lyon toward the palme tree on the other side: thus was it made through all the house round about."
Ezekiel,41,20,From the grounde vnto aboue the doore were Cherubims and palme trees made as in the wall of the Temple.
Ezekiel,41,21,"The postes of the Temple were squared, and thus to looke vnto was the similitude and forme of the Sanctuarie."
Ezekiel,41,22,"The altar of wood was three cubites hie, and the length thereof two cubites, and the corners thereof and the length thereof and the sides thereof were of wood. And he sayd vnto me, This is the table that shalbe before the Lord."
Ezekiel,41,23,And the Temple and the Sanctuarie had two doores.
Ezekiel,41,24,"And the doores had two wickets, euen two turning wickets, two wickets for one doore, and two wickets for another doore."
Ezekiel,41,25,"And vpon the doores of the Temple there were made Cherubims and palmetrees, like as was made vpon the walles, and there were thicke plankes vpon the forefront of the porch without."
Ezekiel,41,26,"And there were narow windowes and palme trees on the one side, and on the other side, by the sides of the porch, and vpon ye sides of the house, and thicke plankes."
Ezekiel,42,1,"Then brought hee me into the vtter court by the way towarde the North, and he brought me into the chamber that was ouer against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the North."
Ezekiel,42,2,"Before ye length of an hundreth cubites, was the North doore, and it was fiftie cubites broad."
Ezekiel,42,3,"Ouer against the twentie cubites which were for the inner court, and ouer against the pauement, which was for the vtter court, was chamber against chamber in three rowes."
Ezekiel,42,4,"And before the chambers was a gallery of ten cubites wide, and within was a way of one cubite, and their doores towarde the North."
Ezekiel,42,5,"Nowe the chambers aboue were narower: for those chambers seemed to eate vp these, to wit, the lower, and those that were in the middes of the building."
Ezekiel,42,6,"For they were in three rowes, but had not pillars as the pillars of the court: therefore there was a difference from them beneath and from the middlemost, euen from the ground."
Ezekiel,42,7,"And the wall that was without ouer against the chambers, toward the vtter court on the forefront of the chambers, was fiftie cubites long."
Ezekiel,42,8,"For the length of the chambers that were in the vtter court, was fiftie cubites: and loe, before the Temple were an hundreth cubites."
Ezekiel,42,9,"And vnder these chambers was the entrie, on the East side, as one goeth into them from the outward court."
Ezekiel,42,10,"The chambers were in the thicknesse of the wall of the court towarde the East, ouer against the separate place, and ouer against the building."
Ezekiel,42,11,"And the way before them was after ye maner of the chambers, which were toward ye North, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their entries were like, both according to their facions, and according to their doores."
Ezekiel,42,12,"And according to ye doores of ye chambers that were towarde the South, was a doore in the corner of the way, euen the way directly before the wall toward the East, as one entreth."
Ezekiel,42,13,"The said he vnto me, The North chambers and ye South chambers which are before ye separate place, they be holy chambers, wherein the Priests that approch vnto ye Lord, shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meate offering, and the sinne offering, and the trespasse offring: for the place is holy."
Ezekiel,42,14,"When the Priestes enter therein, they shall not go out of the holy place into the vtter court, but there they shall lay their garmentes wherein they minister: for they are holy, and shall put on other garmentes, and so shall approch to those things, which are for the people."
Ezekiel,42,15,"Nowe when he had made an ende of measuring the inner house, he brought mee forth toward the gate whose prospect is towarde the East, and measured it round about."
Ezekiel,42,16,"He measured the East side with the measuring rod, fiue hundreth reedes, euen with the measuring reede round about."
Ezekiel,42,17,"He measured also the Northside, fiue hundreth reedes, euen with the measuring reede rounde about."
Ezekiel,42,18,And he measured the South side fiue hundreth reedes with the measuring reede.
Ezekiel,42,19,"He turned about also to the West side, and measured fiue hundreth reedes with the measuring reede."
Ezekiel,42,20,"He measured it by the foure sides: it had a wall round about, fiue hundreth reedes long, and fiue hundreth broade to make a separation betweene the Sanctuarie, and the prophane place."
Ezekiel,43,1,"Afterward he brought me to the gate, euen the gate that turneth towarde the East."
Ezekiel,43,2,"And beholde, the glorie of the God of Israel came from out of the East, whose voyce was like a noyse of great waters, and the earth was made light with his glorie."
Ezekiel,43,3,"And the vision which I saw was like the vision, euen as the vision that I sawe when I came to destroy the citie: and the visions were like the vision that I sawe by the riuer Chebar: and I fell vpon my face."
Ezekiel,43,4,"And the glorie of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate, whose prospect is towarde the East."
Ezekiel,43,5,"So the Spirite tooke me vp and brought me into the inner court, and beholde, the glorie of the Lord filled the house."
Ezekiel,43,6,"And I heard one speaking vnto me out of the house: and there stoode a man by me,"
Ezekiel,43,7,"Which saide vnto me, Sonne of man, this place is my throne, and the place of the soles of my feete, whereas I will dwell among the children of Israel for euer, and the house of Israel shall no more defile mine holy Name, neither they, nor their Kings by their fornication, nor by the carkeises of their Kings in their high places."
Ezekiel,43,8,"Albeit they set their thresholdes by my thresholdes, and their postes by my postes (for there was but a wall betweene me and them) yet haue they defiled mine holy Name with their abominations, that they haue committed: wherfore I haue consumed them in my wrath."
Ezekiel,43,9,"Now therefore let them put away their fornication, and the carkeises of their Kings farre from me, and I will dwell among them for euer."
Ezekiel,43,10,"Thou sonne of man, shew this House to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their wickednes, and let them measure ye paterne."
Ezekiel,43,11,"And if they be ashamed of all that they haue done, shew them the forme of the House, and ye paterne thereof, and the going out thereof, and the coming in thereof, and the whole fashion thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the figures thereof, and all the lawes thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keepe the whole fashion thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them."
Ezekiel,43,12,"This is the description of the house, It shalbe vpon the toppe of the mount: all the limites thereof round about shalbe most holy. Beholde, this is the description of the house."
Ezekiel,43,13,"And these are the measures of the Altar, after the cubites, the cubite is a cubite, and an had breadth, euen the bottome shalbe a cubite, and the breadth a cubite, and the border thereof by the edge thereof rounde about shalbe a spanne: and this shalbe the height of the altar."
Ezekiel,43,14,"And from the bottome which toucheth the ground to the lower piece shalbe two cubites: and the breadth one cubite, and from the litle piece to the great piece shalbe foure cubites, and the breadth one cubite."
Ezekiel,43,15,"So the altar shalbe foure cubites, and from the altar vpward shalbe foure hornes."
Ezekiel,43,16,"And the altar shalbe twelue cubites long, and twelue broade, and fouresquare in the foure corners thereof."
Ezekiel,43,17,"And ye frame shalbe foureteene cubites log, and fourteene broade in the fouresquare corners thereof, and the border about it shalbe halfe a cubite, and the bottome therof shalbe a cubite about, and the steps thereof shalbe turned towarde ye East."
Ezekiel,43,18,"And he said vnto me, Sone of man, thus saith ye Lord God, These are ye ordinances of ye altar in the day when they shall make it to offer the burnt offring thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon."
Ezekiel,43,19,"And thou shalt giue to the Priestes, and to the Leuites, that be of the seede of Zadok, which approch vnto me, to minister vnto me, saith the Lord God, a yong bullocke for a sinne offring."
Ezekiel,43,20,"And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the foure hornes of it, and on the foure corners of the frame, and vpon the border round about: thus shalt thou clense it, and reconcile it."
Ezekiel,43,21,"Thou shalt take the bullocke also of the sinne offring, and burne it in the appointed place of the house without the Sanctuarie."
Ezekiel,43,22,"But the second day thou shalt offer an hee goat without blemish for a sinne offring, and they shall clense ye altar, as they did clense it with the bullocke."
Ezekiel,43,23,"When thou hast made an ende of clensing it, thou shalt offer a yong bullocke without blemish, and a ram out of the flocke without blemish."
Ezekiel,43,24,"And thou shalt offer them before ye Lord, and the Priestes shall cast salt vpon them, and they shall offer them for a burnt offring vnto ye Lord."
