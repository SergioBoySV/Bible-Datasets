Exodus,3,2,"Then the Angel of the Lord appeared vnto him in a flame of fire, out of the middes of a bush: and he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed."

Exodus,8,7,"And the sorcerers did likewise with their sorceries, and brought frogges vp vpon the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,8,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Pray ye vnto the Lord, that hee may take away the frogges from mee, and from my people, and I will let the people goe, that they may doe sacrifice vnto the Lord."
Exodus,8,9,"And Moses said vnto Pharaoh, Concerning me, euen command when I shall pray for thee, and for thy seruants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogges from thee and from thine houses, that they may remaine in the riuer only."
Exodus,8,10,"Then he said, To morowe. And he answered, Be it as thou hast said, that thou maiest know, that there is none like vnto the Lord our God."
Exodus,8,11,"So the frogges shall depart from thee, and from thine houses, and from thy seruantes, and from thy people: onely they shall remaine in the riuer."
Exodus,8,12,"Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cryed vnto the Lord concerning the frogges, which hee had sent vnto Pharaoh."
Exodus,8,13,"And the Lord did according to the saying of Moses: so the frogges died in the houses, in the townes, and in the fieldes."
Exodus,8,14,"And they gathered the together by heaps, and the land stanke of them."
Exodus,8,15,"But when Pharaoh sawe that hee had rest giuen him, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not vnto them, as the Lord had said."
Exodus,8,16,"Againe the Lord sayd vnto Moses, Say vnto Aaron, Stretche out the rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may bee turned to lyce throughout all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,17,"And they did so: for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth: and lyce came vpon man and vpon beast: all the dust of the earth was lyce throughout all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,8,18,"Nowe the enchanters assaied likewise with their enchantments to bring forth lyce, but they could not. So the lyce were vpon man and vpon beast."
Exodus,8,19,"Then saide the enchanters vnto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God. But Pharaohs heart remained obstinate, and hee hearkened not vnto them, as the Lord had said."
Exodus,8,20,"Moreouer the Lord sayd to Moses, Rise vp earely in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh (lo, hee will come forth vnto the water) and say vnto him, Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serue me."
Exodus,8,21,"Els, if thou wilt not let my people goe, behold, I will send swarmes of flies both vpon thee, and vpon thy seruants, and vpon thy people, and into thine houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shalbe full of swarmes of flies, and the ground also whereon they are."
Exodus,8,22,"But ye land of Goshe, where my people are, wil I cause to be wonderfull in that day, so that no swarmes of flies shalbe there, that thou maiest know that I am the Lord in the middes of the earth."
Exodus,8,23,And I will make a deliuerance of my people from thy people: to morowe shall this miracle be.
Exodus,8,24,"And the Lord did so: for there came great swarmes of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his seruants houses, so that through all the lande of Egypt, the earth was corrupt by the swarmes of flies."
Exodus,8,25,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and saide, Goe, doe sacrifice vnto your God in this lande."
Exodus,8,26,"But Moses answered, It is not meete to do so: for then we shoulde offer vnto the Lord our God that, which is an abomination vnto the Egyptians. Loe, can we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and they not stone vs?"
Exodus,8,27,"Let vs go three dayes iourney in the desert, and sacrifice vnto the Lord our God, as he hath commanded vs."
Exodus,8,28,"And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice vnto the Lord your God in the wildernesse: but goe not farre away, pray for me."
Exodus,8,29,"And Moses said, Behold, I will go out from thee, and pray vnto the Lord, that the swarmes of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his seruants, and from his people to morowe: but let Pharaoh from hencefoorth deceiue no more, in not suffering the people to sacrifice vnto the Lord."
Exodus,8,30,So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed vnto the Lord.
Exodus,8,31,"And the Lord did according to the saying of Moses, and the swarmes of flies departed from Pharaoh, from his seruants, and from his people, and there remained not one."
Exodus,8,32,"Yet Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, and did not let the people goe."
Exodus,9,1,"Then the Lord said vnto Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Ebrewes, Let my people go, that they may serue me."
Exodus,9,2,"But if thou refuse to let them goe, and wilt yet holde them still,"
Exodus,9,3,"Beholde, the hande of the Lord is vpon thy flocke which is in the fielde: for vpon the horses, vpon the asses, vpon the camels, vpon the cattell, and vpon the sheepe shalbe a mightie great moraine."
Exodus,9,4,"And the Lord shall doe wonderfully betweene the beastes of Israel, and the beastes of Egypt: so that there shall nothing dye of all, that pertaineth to the children of Israel."
Exodus,9,5,"And the Lord appointed a time, saying, To morowe the Lord shall finish this thing in this lande."
Exodus,9,6,"So the Lord did this thing on the morow, and all the cattel of Egypt dyed: but of the cattell of the children of Israel dyed not one."
Exodus,9,7,"Then Pharaoh sent, and beholde, there was not one of the cattell of the Israelites dead: and the heart of Pharaoh was obstinate, and hee did not let the people goe."
Exodus,9,8,"And the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, Take your handfull of ashes of the fornace, and Moses shall sprinkle them towarde the heauen in the sight of Pharaoh,"
Exodus,9,9,"And they shall be turned to dust in all the land of Egypt: and it shalbe as a scab breaking out into blisters vpon man, and vpon beast, thorow out all the land of Egypt."
Exodus,9,10,"Then they tooke ashes of the fornace, and stoode before Pharaoh: and Moses sprinkled them towarde the heauen, and there came a scab breaking out into blisters vpon man, and vpon beast."
Exodus,9,11,"And the sorcerers could not stande before Moses, because of the scab: for the scab was vpon the enchanters, and vpon all the Egyptians."
Exodus,9,12,"And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not vnto them, as the Lord had said vnto Moses."
Exodus,9,13,"Also the Lord said vnto Moses, Rise vp early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Ebrewes, Let my people goe, that they may serue me."
Exodus,9,14,"For I will at this time send all my plagues vpon thine heart, and vpon thy seruants, and vpon thy people, that thou mayest knowe that there is none like me in all the earth."
Exodus,9,15,"For nowe I will stretch out mine hande, that I may smite thee and thy people with the pestilence: and thou shalt perish from the earth."
Exodus,9,16,"And in deede, for this cause haue I appointed thee, to shewe my power in thee, and to declare my Name throughout all the world."
Exodus,9,17,"Yet thou exaltest thy selfe against my people, and lettest them not goe."
Exodus,9,18,"Beholde, to morowe this time I will cause to raine a mightie great haile, such as was not in Egypt since the foundation thereof was laid vnto this time."
Exodus,9,19,"Send therefore nowe, and gather the cattell, and all that thou hast in the fielde: for vpon all the men, and the beastes, which are found in the field, and not brought home, the haile shall fall vpon them, and they shall die."
Exodus,9,20,"Such then as feared the word of the Lord among the seruants of Pharaoh, made his seruants and his cattell flee into the houses:"
Exodus,9,21,"But such as regarded not the worde of the Lord, left his seruants, and his cattell in the fielde."
Exodus,9,22,"And the Lord saide to Moses, Stretche foorth thine hande towarde heauen, that there may be haile in all the land of Egypt, vpon man, and vpon beast, and vpon all the herbes of the fielde in the lande of Egypt."
Exodus,9,23,"Then Moses stretched out his rod towarde heauen, and the Lord sent thunder and haile, and lightening vpon the ground: and the Lord caused haile to raine vpon the land of Egypt."
Exodus,9,24,"So there was haile, and fire mingled with the haile, so grieuous, as there was none throughout all the lande of Egypt, since it was a nation."
Exodus,9,25,"And the haile smote throughout al ye land of Egypt all that was in the fielde, both man and beast: also ye haile smote all the herbes of ye field, and brake to pieces all the trees of the fielde."
Exodus,9,26,Onely in the lande of Goshen (where the children of Israel were) was no haile.
Exodus,9,27,"Then Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron, and said vnto them, I haue now sinned: the Lord is righteous, but I and my people are wicked."
Exodus,9,28,"Pray ye vnto the Lord (for it is ynough) that there be no more mightie thunders and haile, and I will let you goe, and yee shall tarie no longer."
Exodus,9,29,"Then Moses saide vnto him, Assoone as I am out of the citie, I will spreade mine hands vnto the Lord, and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more haile, that thou mayest knowe that the earth is the Lordes."
Exodus,9,30,"As for thee and thy seruants, I knowe afore I pray ye will feare before the face of the Lord God."
Exodus,9,31,"(And the flaxe, and the barley were smitten: for the barley was eared, and the flaxe was bolled."
Exodus,9,32,"But the wheat and the rye were not smitten, for they were hid in the grounde)"
Exodus,9,33,"Then Moses went out of the citie from Pharaoh, and spred his hands to the Lord, and the thunder and the haile ceased, neither rained it vpon the earth."
Exodus,9,34,"And when Pharaoh sawe that the raine and the haile and the thunder were ceased, hee sinned againe, and hardened his heart, both he, and his seruants."
Exodus,9,35,"So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened: neither would he let the children of Israel goe, as the Lord had said by Moses."
Exodus,10,1,"Againe the Lord saide vnto Moses, Goe to Pharaoh: for I haue hardened his heart, and the heart of his seruants, that I might worke these my miracles in the middes of his realme,"
Exodus,10,2,"And that thou maist declare in the eares of thy sonne, and of thy sonnes sonne, what things I haue done in Egypt, and my miracles, which I haue done among them: that ye may knowe that I am the Lord."
Exodus,10,3,"Then came Moses and Aaron vnto Pharaoh, and they said vnto him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Ebrewes, Howe long wilt thou refuse to humble thy selfe before me? Let my people goe, that they may serue me."
Exodus,10,4,"But if thou refuse to let my people go, beholde, to morowe will I bring grashoppers into thy coastes."
Exodus,10,5,"And they shall couer the face of the earth, that a man can not see the earth: and they shall eate the residue which remaineth vnto you, and hath escaped from the haile: and they shall eate all your trees that bud in the fielde."
Exodus,10,6,"And they shall fil thine houses, and all thy seruants houses, and the houses of all the Egyptians, as neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers fathers haue seene, since the time they were vpon the earth vnto this day. So he returned, and went out from Pharaoh."
Exodus,10,7,"Then Pharaohs seruants saide vnto him, How long shall he be an offence vnto vs? let the men go, that they may serue the Lord their God: wilt thou first knowe that Egypt is destroyed?"
Exodus,10,8,"So Moses and Aaron were brought againe vnto Pharaoh, and he saide vnto them, Goe, serue the Lord your God, but who are they that shall goe?"
Exodus,10,9,"And Moses answered, We will go with our yong and with our olde, with our sonnes and with our daughters, with our sheepe and with our cattell will we goe: for we must celebrate a feast vnto the Lord."
Exodus,10,10,"And he said vnto them, Let the Lord so be with you, as I will let you goe and your children: beholde, for euill is before your face."
Exodus,10,11,"It shall not be so: nowe goe ye that are men, and serue the Lord: for that was your desire. Then they were thrust out from Pharaohs presence."
Exodus,10,12,"After, the Lord said vnto Moses, Stretch out thine hande vpon the lande of Egypt for the grashoppers, that they may come vpon the lande of Egypt, and eate all the herbes of the land, euen all that the haile hath left."
Exodus,10,13,"Then Moses stretched foorth his rod vpon the lande of Egypt: and the Lord brought an East winde vpon the land all that day, and al that night: and in the morning the East wind brought the grashoppers."
Exodus,10,14,"So the grashoppers went vp vpon all the land of Egypt, and remained in all quarters of Egypt: so grieuous Grashoppers, like to these were neuer before, neither after them shalbe such."
Exodus,10,15,"For they couered all the face of the earth, so that the lande was darke: and they did eate all the herbes of the lande, and all the fruites of the trees, which the haile had left, so that there was no greene thing left vpon the trees, nor among the herbes of the fielde throughout all the lande of Egypt."
Exodus,10,16,"Therefore Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and sayde, I haue sinned against the Lord your God, and against you."
Exodus,10,17,"And nowe forgiue mee my sinne onely this once, and pray vnto the Lord your God, that hee may take away from me this death onely."
Exodus,10,18,"Moses then went out from Pharaoh, and prayed vnto the Lord."
Exodus,10,19,"And the Lord turned a mightie strong West winde, and tooke away the grashoppers, and violently cast them into the red Sea, so that there remained not one grashopper in all the coast of Egypt."
Exodus,10,20,"But the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart, and hee did not let the children of Israel goe."
Exodus,10,21,"Againe ye Lord said vnto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heauen, that there may be vpon the lande of Egypt darkenesse, euen darkenesse that may be felt."
Exodus,10,22,"Then Moses stretched forth his hande towarde heauen, and there was a blacke darkenesse in all the land of Egypt three daies."
Exodus,10,23,"No man saw an other, neither rose vp from ye place where he was for three dayes: but all the children of Israel had light where they dwelt."
Exodus,10,24,"The Pharaoh called for Moses and said, Go, serue the Lord: onely your sheepe and your cattel shall abide, and your children shall go with you."
Exodus,10,25,"And Moses sayd, Thou must giue vs also sacrifices, and burnt offrings that wee may doe sacrifice vnto the Lord our God."
Exodus,10,26,"Therefore our cattell also shall go with vs: there shall not an hoofe bee left, for thereof must we take to serue the Lord our God: neither doe wee knowe howe we shall serue the Lord, vntill we come thither."
Exodus,10,27,"(But the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart, and he would not let them goe)"
Exodus,10,28,"And Pharaoh sayde vnto him, Get thee from mee: looke thou see my face no more: for whensoeuer thou commest in my sight, thou shalt dye."
Exodus,10,29,"Then Moses said, Thou hast said well: from henceforth will I see thy face no more."
Exodus,11,1,"Now the Lord had saide vnto Moses, yet will I bring one plague more vpon Pharaoh, and vpon Egypt: after that, he will let you go hence: when he letteth you goe, he shall at once chase you hence."
Exodus,11,2,"Speake thou nowe to the people, that euery man require of his neighbour, and euery woman of her neighbour iewels of siluer and iewels of gold."
Exodus,11,3,"And the Lord gaue the people fauour in the sight of the Egyptians: also Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaohs seruantes, and in the sight of the people.)"
Exodus,11,4,"Also Moses sayde, Thus sayth the Lord, About midnight will I goe out into the middes of Egypt."
Exodus,11,5,"And all the first borne in the lande of Egypt shall die, from the first borne of Pharaoh that sitteth on his throne, vnto the first borne of the maide seruant, that is at the mille, and all the first borne of beastes."
Exodus,11,6,"Then there shalbe a great crie throughout all the land of Egypt, such as was neuer none like, nor shalbe."
Exodus,11,7,"But against none of ye children of Israel shall a dogge moue his tongue, neyther against man nor beast, that ye may knowe that the Lord putteth a difference betweene the Egyptians and Israel."
Exodus,11,8,"And all these thy seruants shall come downe vnto me, and fal before me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that are at thy feete, and after this will I depart. So he went out from Pharaoh very angry."
Exodus,11,9,"And the Lord saide vnto Moses, Pharaoh shall not heare you, that my wonders may bee multiplied in the land of Egypt."
Exodus,11,10,"So Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: but the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart, and he suffred not the children of Israel to goe out of his lande."
Exodus,12,1,"Then the Lord spake to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,"
Exodus,12,2,This moneth shalbe vnto you the beginning of moneths: it shalbe to you the first moneth of the yere.
Exodus,12,3,"Speake ye vnto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth of this moneth let euery man take vnto him a lambe, according to the house of the fathers, a lambe for an house."
Exodus,12,4,"And if the housholde be too litle for the lambe, he shall take his neighbour, which is next vnto his house, according to the nomber of the persons: euery one of you, according to his eating shall make your count for the lambes,"
Exodus,12,5,"Your lambe shalbe without blemish, a male of a yeere olde: ye shall take it of the lambes, or of the kiddes."
Exodus,12,6,And yee shall keepe it vntill the fourteenth day of this moneth: then al the multitude of the Congregation of Israel shall kill it at euen.
Exodus,12,7,"After, they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two postes, and on the vpper doore post of the houses where they shall eate it."
Exodus,12,8,"And they shall eate the flesh the same night, roste with fire, and vnleauened bread: with sowre herbes they shall eate it."
Exodus,12,9,"Eate not thereof rawe, boyled nor sodden in water, but rost with fire, both his head, his feete, and his purtenance."
Exodus,12,10,"And ye shall reserue nothing of it vnto the morning: but that, which remaineth of it vnto the morowe, shall ye burne with fire."
Exodus,12,11,"And thus shall yee eate it, Your loynes girded, your shoes on your feete, and your staues in your handes, and yee shall eate it in haste: for it is the Lords Passeouer."
Exodus,12,12,"For I will passe through the lande of Egypt the same night, and will smite all the first borne in the land of Egypt, both man and beast, and I will execute iudgement vpon all the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord."
Exodus,12,13,"And the blood shalbe a token for you vpon the houses where ye are: so when I see the blood, I will passe ouer you, and the plague shall not be vpon you to destruction, when I smite the lande of Egypt."
Exodus,12,14,"And this day shalbe vnto you a remembrance: and ye shall keepe it an holie feast vnto the Lord, throughout your generations: yee shall keepe it holie by an ordinance for euer."
Exodus,12,15,"Seuen daies shall ye eat vnleauened bread, and in any case ye shall put away leauen the first day out of your houses: for whosoeuer eateth leauened bread from the first daie vntill the seuenth day, that person shalbe cut off from Israel."
Exodus,12,16,"And in the first day shalbe an holie assemblie: also in the seuenth day shalbe an holy assemblie vnto you: no worke shalbe done in them, saue about that which euery man must eate: that onely may ye do."
Exodus,12,17,"Ye shall keepe also the feast of vnleauened bread: for that same daye I will bring your armies out of the lande of Egypt: therefore ye shall obserue this day, throughout your posteritie, by an ordinance for euer."
Exodus,12,18,"In the first moneth and the fourteenth day of the moneth at euen, yee shall eate vnleauened bread vnto the one and twentieth day of the moneth at euen."
Exodus,12,19,"Seuen daies shall no leauen be founde in your houses: for whosoeuer eateth leauened bread, that person shalbe cut off from the Congregation of Israel: whether he bee a stranger, or borne in the land."
Exodus,12,20,Ye shall eate no leauened bread: but in all your habitations shall ye eate vnleauened bread.
Exodus,12,21,"Then Moses called all the Elders of Israel, and saide vnto them, Choose out and take you for euerie of your housholdes a lambe, and kill the Passeouer."
Exodus,12,22,"And take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basen, and strike the lintell, and the doore cheekes with the blood that is in the basen, and let none of you goe out at the doore of his house, vntill the morning."
Exodus,12,23,"For the Lord will passe by to smite the Egyptians: and when he seeth the blood vpon the lintel and on the two doore cheekes, the Lord wil passe ouer the doore, and wil not suffer the destroyer to come into your houses to plague you."
Exodus,12,24,Therefore shall ye obserue this thing as an ordinance both for thee and thy sonnes for euer.
Exodus,12,25,"And when ye shall come into the land, which the Lord will giue you as hee hath promised, then ye shall keepe this seruice."
Exodus,12,26,"And when your children aske you, What seruice is this ye keepe?"
Exodus,12,27,"Then ye shall saye, It is the sacrifice of the Lordes Passeouer, which passed ouer the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and preserued our houses. Then the people bowed them selues, and worshipped."
Exodus,12,28,"So the children of Israel went, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron: so did they."
Exodus,12,29,"Nowe at midnight, the Lord smote all the first borne in the lande of Egypt, from the first borne of Pharaoh that sate on his throne, vnto the first borne of the captiue that was in prison, and all the first borne of beastes."
Exodus,12,30,"And Pharaoh rose vp in the night, he, and all his seruants and all the Egyptians: and there was a great crye in Egypt: for there was no house where there was not one dead."
Exodus,12,31,"And hee called to Moses and to Aaron by night, and saide, Rise vp, get you out from among my people, both yee, and the children of Israel, and goe serue the Lord as ye haue sayde."
Exodus,12,32,"Take also your sheepe and your cattell as yee haue sayde, and depart, and blesse me also."
Exodus,12,33,"And the Egyptians did force the people, because they would send them out of the land in haste: for they said, We die all."
Exodus,12,34,"Therfore the people tooke their dough before it was leauened, euen their dough bound in clothes vpon their shoulders."
Exodus,12,35,"And the children of Israel did according to the saying of Moses, and they asked of ye Egyptians iewels of siluer and iewels of gold, and raiment."
Exodus,12,36,And the Lord gaue the people fauour in the sight of the Egyptians: and they graunted their request: so they spoyled the Egyptians.
Exodus,12,37,"Then the children of Israel tooke their iourney from Rameses to Succoth about sixe hundreth thousand men of foote, beside children."
Exodus,12,38,"And a great multitude of sundrie sortes of people went out with them, and sheepe, and beeues, and cattel in great abundance."
Exodus,12,39,"And they baked the dough which they brought out of Egypt, and made vnleauened cakes: for it was not leauened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, neither coulde they tarie, nor yet prepare themselues vitailes."
Exodus,12,40,"So the dwelling of the children of Israel, while they dwelled in Egypt, was foure hundreth and thirtie yeres."
Exodus,12,41,"And when the foure hundreth and thirtie yeeres were expired, euen the selfe same day departed all the hostes of the Lord out of the land of Egypt."
Exodus,12,42,"It is a night to be kept holie to the Lord, because he brought them out of the lande of Egypt: this is that night of the Lord, which all the children of Israel must keepe throughout their generations."
Exodus,12,43,"Also the Lord said vnto Moses and Aaron, This is the Lawe of the Passeouer: no stranger shall eate thereof."
Exodus,12,44,"But euerie seruant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof."
Exodus,12,45,A stranger or an hyred seruant shall not eat thereof.
Exodus,12,46,"In one house shall it bee eaten: thou shalt carie none of ye flesh out of the house, neither shall ye breake a bone thereof."
Exodus,12,47,All the Congregation of Israel shall obserue it.
Exodus,12,48,"But if a stranger dwell with thee, and will obserue the Passeouer of the Lord, let him circumcise all the males, that belong vnto him, and then let him come and obserue it, and he shall be as one that is borne in the land: for none vncircumcised person shall eate thereof."
Exodus,12,49,"One lawe shalbe to him that is borne in the land, and to the stranger that dwelleth among you."
Exodus,12,50,Then all the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron: so did they.
Exodus,12,51,And the selfe same day did the Lord bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
Exodus,13,1,"And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
Exodus,13,2,"Sanctifie vnto me all the first borne: that is, euery one that first openeth the wombe among the children of Israel, as well of man as of beast: for it is mine."
Exodus,13,3,"Then Moses sayd vnto the people, Remember this day in the which ye came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage: for by a mightie hande the Lord brought you out from thence: therefore no leauened bread shall bee eaten."
Exodus,13,4,This day come yee out in the moneth of Abib.
Exodus,13,5,"Now when the Lord hath brought thee into the land of the Canaanites, and Hittites, and Amorites, and Hiuites, and Iebusites (which he sware vnto thy fathers, that he woulde giue thee, a land flowing with milke and honie) then thou shalt keepe this seruice in this moneth."
Exodus,13,6,"Seuen dayes shalt thou eate vnleauened bread, and the seuenth day shall be the feast of the Lord."
Exodus,13,7,"Vnleauened bread shall bee eaten seuen dayes, and there shall no leauened bread be seene with thee, nor yet leauen be seene with thee in all thy quarters."
Exodus,13,8,"And thou shalt shew thy sonne in that day, saying, This is done, because of that which the Lord did vnto me, when I came out of Egypt."
Exodus,13,9,"And it shalbe a signe vnto thee vpon thine hande, and for a remembrance betweene thine eyes, that the Lawe of the Lord may be in thy mouth: for by a strong hand the Lord brought thee out of Egypt."
Exodus,13,10,Keepe therefore this ordinance in his season appoynted from yeere to yeere.
Exodus,13,11,"And when the Lord shall bring thee into the lande of the Canaanites, as hee sware vnto thee and to thy fathers, and shall giue it thee,"
Exodus,13,12,"Then thou shalt set apart vnto the Lord all that first openeth the wombe: also euery thing that first doeth open the wombe, and commeth forth of thy beast: the males shalbe the Lordes."
Exodus,13,13,"But euery first foale of an asse, thou shalt redeeme with a lambe: and if thou redeeme him not, then thou shalt breake his necke: likewise all the first borne of man among thy sonnes shalt thou bye out."
Exodus,13,14,"And when thy sonne shall aske thee to morowe, saying, What is this? thou shalt then say vnto him, With a mightie hande the Lord brought vs out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
Exodus,13,15,"For when Pharaoh was harde hearted against our departing, the Lord then slewe all the first borne in the lande of Egypt: from the first borne of man euen to the first borne of beast: therefore I sacrifice vnto the Lord all the males that first open the wombe, but all the first borne of my sonnes I redeeme."
Exodus,13,16,"And it shalbe as a token vpon thine hand, and as frontlets betweene thine eyes, that the Lord brought vs out of Egypt by a mightie hande."
Exodus,13,17,"Nowe when Pharaoh had let the people go, God caried them not by the way of the Philistims countrey, though it were neerer: (for God sayd, Lest the people repent whe they see warre, and turne againe to Egypt)"
Exodus,13,18,But God made the people to go about by the way of the wildernesse of the red sea: and the children of Israel went vp armed out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus,13,19,"(And Moses tooke the bones of Ioseph with him: for he had made the children of Israel sweare, saying, God will surely visite you, and ye shall take my bones away hence with you)"
Exodus,13,20,"So they tooke their iourney from Succoth, and camped in Etham in the edge of the wildernesse."
Exodus,13,21,"And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloude to leade them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to giue them light, that they might go both by day and by night."
Exodus,13,22,"He tooke not away the pillar of ye cloude by day, nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people."

Exodus,16,2,And the whole Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wildernesse.
Exodus,16,3,"For the children of Israel sayde to them, Oh that we had dyed by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when wee sate by the flesh pots, when wee ate bread our bellies full: for yee haue brought vs out into this wildernesse, to kill this whole company with famine."
Exodus,16,4,"Then sayd the Lord vnto Moses, Behold, I wil cause bread to rayne from heauen to you, and the people shall goe out, and gather that that is sufficient for euery day, that I may proue them, whether they wil walke in my Law or no."

Exodus,16,8,"Againe Moses sayd, At euen shall the Lord giue you flesh to eate, and in the morning your fil of bread: for the Lord hath heard your murmurings, which ye murmure against him: for what are we? your murmurings are not against vs, but against the Lord."

Exodus,16,15,"And when the children of Israel sawe it, they sayde one to another, It is MAN, for they wist not what it was. And Moses sayd vnto them, This is the breade which the Lord hath giuen you to eate."
Exodus,16,16,This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded: gather of it euery man according to his eating an Omer for a man according to the number of your persons: euery man shall take for them which are in his tent.
Exodus,16,17,"And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some lesse."
Exodus,16,18,"And when they did measure it with an Omer, hee that had gathered much, had nothing ouer, and he that had gathered litle, had no lacke: so euery man gathered according to his eating."

Exodus,16,22,"And the sixt day they gathered twise so much bread, two Omers for one man: then all the rulers of the Congregation came and told Moses."
Exodus,16,23,"And he answered them, This is that, which the Lord hath sayde, To morowe is the rest of the holy Sabbath vnto the Lord: bake that to day which ye wil bake, and seethe that which ye wil seethe, and all that remaineth, lay it vp to be kept till the morning for you."
Exodus,16,24,"And they laied it vp till the morning, as Moses bade, and it stanke not, neyther was there any worme therein."
Exodus,16,25,"Then Moses sayde, Eate that to day: for to day is the Sabbath vnto the Lord: to day ye shall not finde it in the fielde."
Exodus,16,26,"Sixe dayes shall yee gather it, but in the seuenth day is the Sabbath: in it there shalbe none."
Exodus,16,27,"Notwithstanding, there went out some of the people in ye seuenth day for to gather, and they found none."
Exodus,16,28,"And the Lord sayde vnto Moses, Howe long refuse yee to keepe my commandements, and my lawes?"
Exodus,16,29,"Beholde, howe the Lord hath giuen you the Sabbath: therefore he giueth you the sixt day bread for two dayes: tary therefore euery man in his place: let no man goe out of his place the seuenth day."
Exodus,16,30,So the people rested the seuenth day.
Exodus,16,31,"And the house of Israel called the name of it, MAN. and it was like to coriander seede, but white: and the taste of it was like vnto wafers made with hony."
Exodus,16,32,"And Moses said, This is that which the Lord hath commanded, Fill an Omer of it, to keepe it for your posteritie: that they may see the bread wherewith I haue fed you in wildernesse, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt."
Exodus,16,33,"Moses also said to Aaron, Take a pot and put an Omer full of MAN therein, and set it before the Lord to be kept for your posteritie."
Exodus,16,34,"As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laied it vp before the Testimonie to be kept."
Exodus,16,35,"And the children of Israel did eate MAN fourtie yeres, vntill they came vnto a land inhabited: they did eate MAN vntill they came to the borders of the land of Canaan."
Exodus,16,36,The Omer is the tenth part of the Ephah.
Exodus,17,1,"And all the Congregation of the children of Israel departed from the wildernesse of Sin, by their iourneyes at the commandement of the Lord, and camped in Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drinke."
Exodus,17,2,"Wherefore the people contended with Moses, and sayde, Giue vs water that we may drinke. And Moses sayde vnto them, Why contende yee with me? wherefore do ye tempt the Lord?"
Exodus,17,3,"So the people thirsted there for water, and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore hast thou thus brought vs out of Egypt to kill vs and our children and our cattel with thirst?"
Exodus,17,4,"And Moses cried to the Lord, saying, What shall I do to this people? for they be almost ready to stone me."
Exodus,17,5,"And ye Lord answered to Moses, Goe before the people, and take with thee of the Elders of Israel: and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the riuer, take in thine hand, and go:"
Exodus,17,6,"Behold, I will stand there before thee vpon the rocke in Horeb, and thou shalt smite on the rocke, and water shall come out of it, that the people may drinke. And Moses did so in the sight of the Elders of Israel."
Exodus,17,7,"And he called the name of the place, Massah and Meribah, because of the contention of the children of Israel, and because they had tempted the Lord, saying, Is the Lord among vs, or no?"
Exodus,17,8,Then came Amalek and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
Exodus,17,9,"And Moses sayde to Ioshua, Chuse vs out men, and go fight with Amalek: to morowe I will stande on the toppe of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand."
Exodus,17,10,"So Ioshua did as Moses bad him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur, went vp to the top of the hill."
Exodus,17,11,"And when Moses helde vp his hande, Israel preuailed: but when he let his hande downe, Amalek preuailed."
Exodus,17,12,"Nowe Moses handes were heauy: therefore they tooke a stone and put it vnder him, and hee sate vpon it: and Aaron and Hur stayed vp his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side: so his hands were steady vntill the going downe of the sunne."
Exodus,17,13,And Ioshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
Exodus,17,14,"And the Lord sayde to Moses, Write this for a remembrance in the booke, and rehearse it to Ioshua: for I will vtterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from vnder heauen."
Exodus,17,15,"(And Moses builte an altar and called the name of it, Iehouah-nissi)"
Exodus,17,16,"Also he said, The Lord hath sworne, that he will haue warre with Amalek from generation to generation."

Exodus,18,7,"And Moses went out to meete his father in law, and did obeisance and kissed him, and eche asked other of his welfare: and they came into the tent."
Exodus,18,8,"Then Moses told his father in law all that the Lord had done vnto Pharaoh, and to the Egyptians for Israels sake, and all the trauaile that had come vnto them by the way, and howe the Lord deliuered them."
Exodus,18,9,"And Iethro reioyced at all the goodnesse, which the Lord had shewed to Israel, and because he had deliuered them out of the hande of the Egyptians."
Exodus,18,10,"Therfore Iethro sayd, Blessed be the Lord who hath deliuered you out of the hande of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh: who hath also deliuered the people from vnder the hand of the Egyptians."

Exodus,18,13,"Now on the morow, when Moses sate to iudge the people, the people stoode about Moses from morning vnto euen."
Exodus,18,14,"And when Moses father in law saw all that he did to the people, he sayde, What is this that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thy selfe alone, and all the people stande about thee from morning vnto euen?"
Exodus,18,15,"And Moses sayd vnto his father in law, Because the people come vnto me to seeke God."
Exodus,18,16,"When they haue a matter, they come vnto me, and I iudge betweene one and another, and declare the ordinances of God, and his lawes."

Exodus,18,18,"Thou both weariest thy selfe greatly, and this people that is with thee: for the thing is too heauie for thee: thou art not able to doe it thy selfe alone."
Exodus,18,19,"Heare nowe my voyce, (I will giue thee counsell, and God shalbe with thee) be thou for the people to Godwarde, and report thou the causes vnto God,"
Exodus,18,20,"And admonish them of the ordinances, and of the lawes, and shew them the way, wherein they must walke, and the worke that they must do."
Exodus,18,21,"Moreouer, prouide thou among al the people men of courage, fearing God, men dealing truely, hating couetousnesse: and appoynt such ouer them to be rulers ouer thousandes, rulers ouer hundreths, rulers ouer fifties, and rulers ouer tennes."
Exodus,18,22,"And let them iudge the people at all seasons: but euery great matter let them bring vnto thee, and let them iudge all small causes: so shall it be easier for thee, when they shall beare the burden with thee."
Exodus,18,23,"If thou do this thing, (and God so command thee) both thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go quietly to their place."
Exodus,18,24,"So Moses obeyed the voyce of his father in law, and did all that he had sayd:"
Exodus,18,25,"And Moses chose men of courage out of all Israel, and made them heads ouer the people, rulers ouer thousandes, rulers ouer hundreths, rulers ouer fifties, and rulers ouer tennes."

Exodus,18,27,"Afterward Moses let his father in law depart, and he went into his countrey."
Exodus,19,1,"In the third moneth, after the children of Israel were gone out of the lande of Egypt, the same day came they into the wildernes of Sinai."
Exodus,19,2,"For they departed from Rephidim, and came to the desart of Sinai, and camped in the wildernesse: euen there Israel camped before the mount."

Exodus,32,1,"Bvt when the people sawe, that Moses taryed long or he came downe from the mountaine, the people gathered themselues together against Aaron, and sayde vnto him, Vp, make vs gods to goe before vs: for of this Moses (the man that brought vs out of the land of Egypt) we knowe not what is become of him."
Exodus,32,2,"And Aaron said vnto them, Plucke off the golden earings, which are in the eares of your wiues, of your sonnes, and of your daughters, and bring them vnto me."
Exodus,32,3,"Then all ye people pluckt from them selues the golden earings, which were in their eares, and they brought them vnto Aaron."

Exodus,32,7,"Then the Lord said vnto Moses, Go, get thee downe: for thy people which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, hath corrupted their wayes."

Exodus,32,12,"Wherefore shall the Egyptians speake, and say, He hath brought them out maliciously for to slay them in the mountaines, and to consume them from the earth? turne from thy fearce wrath, and change thy minde from this euill towarde thy people."
Exodus,32,13,"Remember Abraham, Izhak, and Israel thy seruants, to whom thou swarest by thine owne selfe, and saydest vnto them, I wil multiply your seede, as the starres of the heauen, and all this land, that I haue spoken of, wil I giue vnto your seede, and they shall inherit it for euer."
Exodus,32,14,"Then the Lord changed his minde from the euil, which he threatned to do vnto his people."
Exodus,32,15,"So Moses returned and went downe from the mountaine with the two Tables of the Testimonie in his hande: the Tables were written on both their sides, euen on the one side and on the other were they written."

Exodus,32,18,"Who answered, It is not the noyse of them that haue the victorie, nor the noyse of them that are ouercome: but I do heare ye noyse of singing."
Exodus,32,19,"Nowe, as soone as he came neere vnto the hoste, he sawe the calfe and the dancing: so Moses wrath waxed hote, and he cast the Tables out of his handes, and brake them in pieces beneath the mountaine."
Exodus,32,20,"After, he tooke the calfe, which they had made, and burned it in the fire, and ground it vnto powder, and strowed it vpon the water, and made the children of Israel drinke of it."
Exodus,32,21,"Also Moses said vnto Aaron, What did this people vnto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sinne vpon them?"
Exodus,32,22,"Then Aaron answered, Let not the wrath of my Lord waxe fearce: Thou knowest this people, that they are euen set on mischiefe."
Exodus,32,23,"And they sayde vnto me, Make vs gods to go before vs: for we knowe not what is become of this Moses (the man that brought vs out of the land of Egypt.)"
Exodus,32,24,"Then I sayde to them, Ye that haue golde, plucke it off: and they brought it me, and I did cast it into the fire, and thereof came this calfe."
Exodus,32,25,Moses therefore sawe that the people were naked (for Aaron had made them naked vnto their shame among their enemies)
Exodus,32,26,"And Moses stoode in ye gate of the campe, and sayde, Who pertaineth to the Lord? let him come to mee. And all the sonnes of Leui gathered themselues vnto him."

Exodus,32,30,"And when the morning came, Moses sayde vnto the people, Yee haue committed a grieuous crime: but now I wil goe vp to the Lord, if I may pacifie him for your sinne."
Exodus,32,31,"Moses therefore went againe vnto ye Lord, and said, Oh, this people haue sinned a great sinne, and haue made them gods of golde."
Exodus,32,32,"Therefore now if thou pardon their sinne, thy mercy shall appeare: but if thou wilt not, I pray thee, rase me out of thy booke, which thou hast written."
Exodus,32,33,"Then the Lord sayd to Moses, Whosoeuer hath sinned against me, I will put out of my booke."
Exodus,32,34,"Go nowe therefore, bring the people vnto the place which I commanded thee: behold, mine Angel shall goe before thee, but yet in the day of my visitation I wil visite their sinne vpon them."

Exodus,33,4,"And when the people heard this euill tydings, they sorowed, and no man put on his best rayment."
Exodus,33,5,"(For the Lord had said to Moses, Say vnto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffe necked people, I wil come suddenly vpon thee, and consume thee: therefore now put thy costly rayment from thee, that I may know what to do vnto thee)"
Exodus,33,6,"So the children of Israel layed their good raiment from them, after Moses came downe from the mount Horeb."
Exodus,33,7,"Then Moses tooke his tabernacle, and pitched it without the host farre off from the hoste, and called it Ohel-moed. And whe any did seeke to the Lord, he went out vnto the Tabernacle of the Congregation, which was without the hoste."

Exodus,33,9,"And assoone as Moses was entred into the Tabernacle, the cloudie pillar descended and stood at the doore of the Tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses."
Exodus,33,10,"Nowe when all the people saw the cloudie pillar stand at the Tabernacle doore, all the people rose vp, and worshipped euery man in his tent doore."
Exodus,33,11,"And the Lord spake vnto Moses, face to face, as a man speaketh vnto his friende. After he turned againe into the hoste, but his seruant Ioshua the sonne of Nun a yong man, departed not out of the Tabernacle."
Exodus,33,12,"Then Moses sayde vnto the Lord, See, thou sayest vnto me, Leade this people forth, and thou hast not shewed me whom thou wilt sende with mee: thou hast sayde moreouer, I knowe thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight."
Exodus,33,13,"Nowe therefore, I pray thee, if I haue founde fauour in thy sight, shewe mee nowe thy way, that I may knowe thee, and that I may finde grace in thy sight: consider also that this nation is thy people."
Exodus,33,14,"And he answered, My presence shall go with thee, and I will giue thee rest."

Exodus,35,21,"And euery one, whose heart encouraged him, and euery one, whose spirit made him willing, came and brought an offring to the Lord, for the worke of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and for all his vses, and for the holy garments."
Exodus,35,22,"Both men and women, as many as were free hearted, came and brought taches and earings, and rings, and bracelets, all were iewels of golde: and euery one that offered an offring of gold vnto the Lord:"

Exodus,35,30,"Then Moses sayde vnto the children of Israel, Beholde, the Lord hath called by name Bezaleel the sonne of Vri, the sonne of Hur of the tribe of Iudah,"
Exodus,35,31,"And hath filled him with an excellent spirit of wisdome, of vnderstanding, and of knowledge, and in all maner worke,"

Exodus,36,2,"For Moses had called Bezaleel, and Aholiab, and all the wise hearted men, in whose heartes the Lord had giuen wisedome, euen as many as their hearts encouraged to come vnto that worke to worke it."
Exodus,36,3,"And they receiued of Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the worke of the seruice of the Sanctuary, to make it: also they brought still vnto him free giftes euery morning."
Exodus,36,4,"So all the wise men, that wrought all the holy worke, came euery man from his worke which they wrought,"
Exodus,36,5,"And spake to Moses, saying, The people bring too much, and more then ynough for the vse of the worke, which the Lord hath commanded to be made."
Exodus,36,6,"Then Moses gaue a commandement, and they caused it to be proclaymed throughout the hoste, saying, Let neither man nor woman prepare any more worke for the oblation of the Sanctuarie. So the people were stayed from offring."
Exodus,36,7,"For the stuffe they had, was sufficient for all the worke to make it, and too much."
Exodus,36,8,"All the cunning men therefore among the workemen, made for the Tabernacle ten curtaines of fine twined linnen, and of blewe silke, and purple, and skarlet: Cherubims of broydred worke made they vpon them."
Exodus,36,9,"The length of one curtaine was twentie and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtaine foure cubites: and the curtaines were all of one cise."

Exodus,36,16,"And hee coupled fiue curtaines by themselues, and sixe curtaines by themselues:"
Exodus,36,17,"Also he made fiftie strings vpon the edge of one curtaine in the seluedge in the coupling, and fiftie strings made hee vpon the edge of the other curtaine in the second coupling."
Exodus,36,18,He made also fiftie taches of brasse to couple the couering that it might be one.
Exodus,36,19,"And he made a couering vpon the pauilion of rams skinnes dyed red, and a couering of badgers skinnes aboue."
Exodus,36,20,"Likewise he made the boards for the Tabernacle, of Shittim wood to stand vp."
Exodus,36,21,"The length of a board was ten cubites, and the bredth of one board was a cubite, and an halfe."
Exodus,36,22,"One board had two tenons, set in order as the feete of a ladder, one against another: thus made he for all the boardes of the Tabernacle."
Exodus,36,23,"So he made twentie boardes for the South side of the Tabernacle, euen full South."

Exodus,36,28,"And two boardes made he in the corners of the Tabernacle, for either side,"
Exodus,36,29,"And they were ioyned beneath, and likewise were made sure aboue with a ring: thus he did to both in both corners."
Exodus,36,30,"So there were eight boards and their sixteene sockets of siluer, vnder euery board two sockets."
Exodus,36,31,"After, he made barres of Shittim wood, fiue for the boards in ye one side of ye Tabernacle,"
Exodus,36,32,"And fiue barres for the boardes in the other side of the Tabernacle, and fiue barres for the boards of the Tabernacle on the side toward the West."
Exodus,36,33,"And he made the middest barre to shoote through the boards, from the one end to ye other."
Exodus,36,34,"He ouerlayd also the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold for places for the barres, and couered the barres with golde."
Exodus,36,35,"Moreouer he made a vaile of blew silke, and purple, and of skarlet, and of fine twined linen: with Cherubims of broydred worke made he it:"
Exodus,36,36,"And made thereunto foure pillars of Shittim, and ouerlayd them with golde: whose hookes were also of golde, and hee cast for them foure sockets of siluer."
Exodus,36,37,"And he made an hanging for the Tabernacle doore, of blew silke, and purple, and skarlet, and fine twined linnen, and needle worke,"

Exodus,37,1,"After this, Bezaleel made the Arke of Shittim wood, two cubites and an halfe long and a cubite and an halfe broade, and a cubite and an halfe hie:"
Exodus,37,2,"And ouerlayde it with fine golde within and without, and made a crowne of golde to it rounde about,"
Exodus,37,3,"And cast for it foure rings of golde for the foure corners of it: that is, two rings for the one side of it, and two rings for the other side thereof."
Exodus,37,4,"Also he made barres of Shittim wood, and couered them with golde,"
Exodus,37,5,"And put the barres in the rings by the sides of the Arke, to beare the Arke."
Exodus,37,6,"And he made the Merciseate of pure golde: two cubites and an halfe was the length thereof, and one cubite and an halfe the breadth thereof."
Exodus,37,7,"And he made two Cherubims of gold, vpon the two endes of the Merciseate: euen of worke beaten with the hammer made he them."
Exodus,37,8,"One Cherub on the one ende, and another Cherub on the other ende: of the Merciseate made he the Cherubims, at ye two endes thereof."
Exodus,37,9,"And the Cherubims spread out their wings on hie, and couered the Merciseat with their wings, and their faces were one towards another: towarde the Merciseat were the faces of the Cherubims."
