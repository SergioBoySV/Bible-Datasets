Job,1,1,"There was a man in the lande of Vz called Iob, and this man was an vpright and iust man, one that feared God, and eschewed euill."
Job,1,2,"And he had seue sonnes, and three daughters."
Job,1,3,"His substance also was seuen thousande sheepe, and three thousand camels, and fiue hundreth yoke of oxen, and fiue hundreth shee asses, and his family was very great, so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East."
Job,1,4,"And his sonnes went and banketted in their houses, euery one his day, and sent, and called their three sisters to eate and to drinke with them."
Job,1,5,"And when the dayes of their banketting were gone about, Iob sent, and sanctified them, and rose vp early in the morning, and offred burnt offrings according to the nomber of them all. For Iob thought, It may be that my sonnes haue sinned, and blasphemed God in their hearts: thus did Iob euery day."
Job,1,6,"Nowe on a day when the children of God came and stoode before the Lord, Satan came also among them."
Job,1,7,"Then the Lord sayde vnto Satan, Whence commest thou? And Satan answered the Lord, saying, From compassing the earth to and from, and from walking in it."
Job,1,8,"And the Lord saide vnto Satan, Hast thou not considered my seruant Iob, how none is like him in the earth? an vpright and iust man, one that feareth God, and escheweth euill?"
Job,1,9,"Then Satan answered the Lord, and sayde, Doeth Iob feare God for nought?"
Job,1,10,"Hast thou not made an hedge about him and about his house, and about all that he hath on euery side? thou hast blessed the worke of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land."
Job,1,11,"But stretch out now thine hand and touch all that he hath, to see if he will not blaspheme thee to thy face."
Job,1,12,"Then the Lord sayde vnto Satan, Lo, all that he hath is in thine hand: onely vpon himselfe shalt thou not stretch out thine hand. So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord."
Job,1,13,"And on a day, when his sonnes and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house,"
Job,1,14,"There came a messenger vnto Iob, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding in their places,"
Job,1,15,"And the Shabeans came violently, and tooke them: yea, they haue slayne the seruants with the edge of the sworde: but I onely am escaped alone to tell thee."
Job,1,16,"And whiles he was yet speaking, another came, and sayde, The fire of God is fallen from the heauen, and hath burnt vp the sheepe and the seruants, and deuoured them: but I onely am escaped alone to tell thee."
Job,1,17,"And whiles he was yet speaking, another came, and sayd, The Caldeans set on three bands, and fell vpon the camels, and haue taken them, and haue slayne the seruantes with the edge of the sworde: but I onely am escaped alone to tell thee."
Job,1,18,"And whiles he was yet speaking, came an other, and sayd, Thy sonnes, and thy daughters were eating, and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house,"
Job,1,19,"And behold, there came a great wind from beyonde the wildernesse, and smote the foure corners of the house, which fel vpon the children, and they are dead, and I onely am escaped alone to tell thee."
Job,1,20,"Then Iob arose, and rent his garment, and shaued his head, and fel downe vpon the ground, and worshipped,"
Job,1,21,"And sayd, Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked shall I returne thither: the Lord hath giuen, and the Lord hath taken it: blessed be the Name of the Lord."
Job,1,22,"In all this did not Iob sinne, nor charge God foolishly."
Job,2,1,"And on a day the children of God came and stood before the Lord, and Satan came also among them, and stoode before the Lord."
Job,2,2,"Then the Lord sayde vnto Satan, Whence commest thou? And Satan answered the Lord, and sayd, From compassing the earth to and from, and from walking in it."
Job,2,3,"And the Lord sayd vnto Satan, Hast thou not considered my seruant Iob, how none is like him in the earth? an vpright and iust man, one that feareth God, and escheweth euill? for yet he continueth in his vprightnesse, although thou mouedst me against him, to destroy him without cause."
Job,2,4,"And Satan answered the Lord, and sayde, Skin for skin, and all that euer a man hath, will he giue for his life."
Job,2,5,"But stretch now out thine hand, and touch his bones and his flesh, to see if he will not blaspheme thee to thy face."
Job,2,6,"Then the Lord said vnto Satan, Lo, he is in thine hand, but saue his life."
Job,2,7,"So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord, and smote Iob with sore boyles, from the sole of his foote vnto his crowne."
Job,2,8,"And he tooke a potsharde to scrape him, and he sate downe among the ashes."
Job,2,9,"Then said his wife vnto him, Doest thou continue yet in thine vprightnes? Blaspheme God, and dye."
Job,2,10,"But he said vnto her, Thou speakest like a foolish woman: what? shall we receiue good at the hande of God, and not receiue euill? In all this did not Iob sinne with his lippes."
Job,2,11,"Nowe when Iobs three friends heard of all this euill that was come vpon him, they came euery one from his owne place, to wit, Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they were agreed together to come to lament with him, and to comfort him."
Job,2,12,"So when they lift vp their eyes a farre off, they knewe him not: therefore they lift vp their voyces and wept, and euery one of them rent his garment, and sprinkled dust vpon their heads toward the heauen."
Job,2,13,"So they sate by him vpon the ground seuen dayes, and seuen nights, and none spake a worde vnto him: for they sawe, that the griefe was very great."
Job,3,1,"Afterward Iob opened his mouth, and cursed his day."
Job,3,2,"And Iob cryed out, and sayd,"
Job,3,3,"Let the day perish, wherein I was borne, and the night when it was sayde, There is a man childe conceiued."
Job,3,4,"Let that day bee darkenesse, let not God regarde it from aboue, neyther let the light shine vpon it,"
Job,3,5,"But let darkenesse, and the shadowe of death staine it: let the cloude remayne vpon it, and let them make it fearefull as a bitter day."
Job,3,6,"Let darkenesse possesse that night, let it not be ioyned vnto the dayes of the yeere, nor let it come into the count of the moneths."
Job,3,7,"Yea, desolate be that night, and let no ioy be in it."
Job,3,8,"Let them that curse the day, (being readie to renue their mourning) curse it."
Job,3,9,"Let the starres of that twilight be dimme through darkenesse of it: let it looke for light, but haue none: neither let it see the dawning of the day,"
Job,3,10,Because it shut not vp the dores of my mothers wombe: nor hid sorowe from mine eyes.
Job,3,11,"Why died I not in the birth? or why dyed I not, when I came out of the wombe?"
Job,3,12,Why did the knees preuent me? and why did I sucke the breasts?
Job,3,13,"For so shoulde I now haue lyen and bene quiet, I should haue slept then, and bene at rest,"
Job,3,14,"With the Kings and counselers of the earth, which haue buylded themselues desolate places:"
Job,3,15,"Or with the princes that had golde, and haue filled their houses with siluer."
Job,3,16,"Or why was I not hid, as an vntimely birth, either as infants, which haue not seene the light?"
Job,3,17,"The wicked haue there ceased from their tyrannie, and there they that laboured valiantly, are at rest."
Job,3,18,"The prisoners rest together, and heare not the voyce of the oppressour."
Job,3,19,"There are small and great, and the seruant is free from his master."
Job,3,20,Wherefore is the light giuen to him that is in miserie? and life vnto them that haue heauie hearts?
Job,3,21,"Which long for death, and if it come not, they would euen search it more then treasures:"
Job,3,22,"Which ioy for gladnes, and reioyce, when they can finde the graue."
Job,3,23,"Why is the light giuen to the man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?"
Job,3,24,"For my sighing commeth before I eate, and my roarings are powred out like the water."
Job,3,25,"For the thing I feared, is come vpon me, and the thing that I was afraid of, is come vnto me."
Job,3,26,"I had no peace, neither had I quietnesse, neither had I rest, yet trouble is come."
Job,4,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, and sayde,"
Job,4,2,"If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieued? but who can withholde himselfe from speaking?"
Job,4,3,"Behold, thou hast taught many, and hast strengthened the wearie hands."
Job,4,4,"Thy wordes haue confirmed him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the weake knees."
Job,4,5,"But now it is come vpon thee, and thou art grieued: it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled."
Job,4,6,"Is not this thy feare, thy confidence, thy pacience, and the vprightnesse of thy wayes?"
Job,4,7,"Remember, I pray thee: who euer perished, being an innocent? or where were the vpright destroyed?"
Job,4,8,"As I haue seene, they that plow iniquitie, and sowe wickednesse, reape the same."
Job,4,9,"With the blast of God they perish, and with the breath of his nostrels are they cosumed."
Job,4,10,"The roaring of the Lion, and the voyce of the Lionesse, and the teeth of the Lions whelpes are broken."
Job,4,11,"The Lyon perisheth for lacke of pray, and the Lyons whelpes are scattered abroade."
Job,4,12,"But a thing was brought to me secretly, and mine eare hath receiued a litle thereof."
Job,4,13,"In the thoughtes of ye visions of the night, when sleepe falleth on men,"
Job,4,14,"Feare came vpon me, and dread which made all my bones to tremble."
Job,4,15,"And the wind passed before me, and made the heares of my flesh to stande vp."
Job,4,16,"Then stoode one, and I knewe not his face: an image was before mine eyes, and in silence heard I a voyce, saying,"
Job,4,17,Shall man be more iust then God? or shall a man be more pure then his maker?
Job,4,18,"Beholde, he founde no stedfastnesse in his Seruants, and laid follie vpon his Angels."
Job,4,19,"Howe much more in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which shalbe destroyed before the moth?"
Job,4,20,"They be destroyed from the morning vnto the euening: they perish for euer, without regarde."
Job,4,21,"Doeth not their dignitie goe away with them? do they not die, and that without wisdom?"
Job,5,1,"Call nowe, if any will answere thee, and to which of the Saintes wilt thou turne?"
Job,5,2,"Doubtlesse anger killeth the foolish, and enuie slayeth the idiote."
Job,5,3,"I haue seene the foolish well rooted, and suddenly I cursed his habitation, saying,"
Job,5,4,"His children shalbe farre from saluation, and they shall be destroyed in the gate, and none shall deliuer them."
Job,5,5,"The hungrie shall eate vp his haruest: yea, they shall take it from among the thornes, and the thirstie shall drinke vp their substance."
Job,5,6,"For miserie commeth not foorth of the dust, neither doeth affliction spring out of the earth."
Job,5,7,"But man is borne vnto trauaile, as the sparkes flie vpwarde."
Job,5,8,"But I would inquire at God, and turne my talke vnto God:"
Job,5,9,"Which doeth great things and vnsearchable, and marueilous things without nomber."
Job,5,10,"He giueth raine vpon the earth, and powreth water vpon the streetes,"
Job,5,11,"And setteth vp on hie them that be lowe, that the sorowfull may be exalted to saluation."
Job,5,12,He scattereth the deuices of the craftie: so that their handes can not accomplish that which they doe enterprise.
Job,5,13,"He taketh the wise in their craftinesse, and the counsel of the wicked is made foolish."
Job,5,14,"They meete with darkenesse in the day time, and grope at noone day, as in the night."
Job,5,15,"But he saueth the poore from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hande of the violent man,"
Job,5,16,"So that the poore hath his hope, but iniquitie shall stop her mouth."
Job,5,17,"Beholde, blessed is the man whome God correcteth: therefore refuse not thou the chastising of the Almightie."
Job,5,18,"For he maketh the wound, and bindeth it vp: he smiteth, and his handes make whole."
Job,5,19,"He shall deliuer thee in sixe troubles, and in the seuenth the euill shall not touch thee."
Job,5,20,In famine he shall deliuer thee from death: and in battel from the power of the sworde.
Job,5,21,"Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue, and thou shalt not be afraid of destruction when it commeth."
Job,5,22,"But thou shalt laugh at destruction and dearth, and shalt not be afraide of the beast of the earth."
Job,5,23,"For the stones of the fielde shall be in league with thee, and the beastes of the field shall be at peace with thee."
Job,5,24,"And thou shalt knowe, that peace shall be in thy tabernacle, and thou shalt visite thine habitation, and shalt not sinne."
Job,5,25,"Thou shalt perceiue also, that thy seede shalbe great, and thy posteritie as the grasse of the earth."
Job,5,26,"Thou shalt goe to thy graue in a ful age, as a ricke of corne commeth in due season into the barne."
Job,5,27,"Lo, thus haue we inquired of it, and so it is: heare this and knowe it for thy selfe."
Job,6,1,"Bvt Iob answered, and said,"
Job,6,2,"Oh that my griefe were well weighed, and my miseries were layed together in the balance."
Job,6,3,For it woulde be nowe heauier then the sande of the sea: therefore my wordes are swallowed vp.
Job,6,4,"For the arrowes of the Almightie are in me, the venime whereof doeth drinke vp my spirit, and the terrours of God fight against me."
Job,6,5,Doeth the wilde asse bray when he hath grasse? or loweth the oxe when he hath fodder?
Job,6,6,"That which is vnsauerie, shall it be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egge?"
Job,6,7,"Such things as my soule refused to touch, as were sorowes, are my meate."
Job,6,8,"Oh that I might haue my desire, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!"
Job,6,9,"That is, that God would destroy me: that he would let his hand go, and cut me off."
Job,6,10,"Then should I yet haue comfort, (though I burne with sorowe, let him not spare) because I haue not denyed the wordes of the Holy one."
Job,6,11,"What power haue I that I should endure? or what is mine end, if I should prolong my life?"
Job,6,12,Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brasse?
Job,6,13,"Is it not so, that there is in me no helpe? and that strength is taken from me?"
Job,6,14,"He that is in miserie, ought to be comforted of his neighbour: but men haue forsaken the feare of the Almightie."
Job,6,15,"My brethre haue deceiued me as a brook, and as the rising of the riuers they passe away."
Job,6,16,"Which are blackish with yee, and wherein the snowe is hid."
Job,6,17,"But in time they are dryed vp with heate and are consumed: and when it is hote they faile out of their places,"
Job,6,18,"Or they depart from their way and course, yea, they vanish and perish."
Job,6,19,"They that go to Tema, considered them, and they that goe to Sheba, waited for them."
Job,6,20,"But they were confounded: when they hoped, they came thither and were ashamed."
Job,6,21,"Surely nowe are ye like vnto it: ye haue seene my fearefull plague, and are afraide."
Job,6,22,"Was it because I said, Bring vnto me? or giue a rewarde to me of your substance?"
Job,6,23,"And deliuer me from the enemies hande, or ransome me out of the hand of tyrants?"
Job,6,24,"Teach me, and I wil hold my tongue: and cause me to vnderstande, wherein I haue erred."
Job,6,25,Howe stedfast are the wordes of righteousnes? and what can any of you iustly reproue?
Job,6,26,"Doe ye imagine to reproue wordes, that the talke of the afflicted should be as the winde?"
Job,6,27,"Ye make your wrath to fall vpon the fatherlesse, and dig a pit for your friende."
Job,6,28,Nowe therefore be content to looke vpon me: for I will not lie before your face.
Job,6,29,"Turne, I pray you, let there be none iniquitie: returne, I say, and ye shall see yet my righteousnesse in that behalfe. Is there iniquitie in my tongue? doeth not my mouth feele sorowes?"
Job,7,1,Is there not an appointed time to man vpon earth? and are not his dayes as the dayes of an hyreling?
Job,7,2,"As a seruant longeth for the shadowe, and as an hyreling looketh for the ende of his worke,"
Job,7,3,"So haue I had as an inheritance the moneths of vanitie, and painefull nights haue bene appointed vnto me."
Job,7,4,"If I layed me downe, I sayde, When shall I arise? and measuring the euening I am euen full with tossing to and from vnto the dawning of the day."
Job,7,5,"My flesh is clothed with wormes and filthinesse of the dust: my skinne is rent, and become horrible."
Job,7,6,"My dayes are swifter then a weauers shittle, and they are spent without hope."
Job,7,7,"Remember that my life is but a wind, and that mine eye shall not returne to see pleasure."
Job,7,8,"The eye that hath seene me, shall see me no more: thine eyes are vpon me, and I shall be no longer."
Job,7,9,"As the cloude vanisheth and goeth away, so he that goeth downe to the graue, shall come vp no more."
Job,7,10,"He shall returne no more to his house, neither shall his place knowe him any more."
Job,7,11,"Therefore I will not spare my mouth, but will speake in the trouble of my spirite, and muse in the bitternesse of my minde."
Job,7,12,"Am I a sea or a whalefish, that thou keepest me in warde?"
Job,7,13,"When I say, My couch shall relieue me, and my bed shall bring comfort in my meditation,"
Job,7,14,"Then fearest thou me with dreames, and astonishest me with visions."
Job,7,15,"Therefore my soule chuseth rather to be strangled and to die, then to be in my bones."
Job,7,16,"I abhorre it, I shall not liue alway: spare me then, for my dayes are but vanitie."
Job,7,17,"What is man, that thou doest magnifie him, and that thou settest thine heart vpon him?"
Job,7,18,"And doest visite him euery morning, and tryest him euery moment?"
Job,7,19,Howe long will it be yer thou depart from me? thou wilt not let me alone whiles I may swallowe my spettle.
Job,7,20,"I haue sinned, what shall I do vnto thee? O thou preseruer of me, why hast thou set me as a marke against thee, so that I am a burden vnto my selfe?"
Job,7,21,"And why doest thou not pardon my trespasse? and take away mine iniquitie? for nowe shall I sleepe in the dust, and if thou seekest me in the morning, I shall not be found."
Job,8,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and saide,"
Job,8,2,Howe long wilt thou talke of these things? and howe long shall the wordes of thy mouth be as a mightie winde?
Job,8,3,Doeth God peruert iudgement? or doeth the Almightie subuert iustice?
Job,8,4,"If thy sonnes haue sinned against him, and he hath sent them into the place of their iniquitie,"
Job,8,5,"Yet if thou wilt early seeke vnto God, and pray to the Almightie,"
Job,8,6,"If thou be pure and vpright, then surely hee will awake vp vnto thee, and he wil make the habitation of thy righteousnesse prosperous."
Job,8,7,"And though thy beginning be small, yet thy latter ende shall greatly encrease."
Job,8,8,"Inquire therefore, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thy selfe to search of their fathers."
Job,8,9,"(For we are but of yesterday, and are ignorant: for our dayes vpon earth are but a shadowe)"
Job,8,10,"Shall not they teach thee and tell thee, and vtter the wordes of their heart?"
Job,8,11,Can a rush grow without myre? or can ye grasse growe without water?
Job,8,12,"Though it were in greene and not cutte downe, yet shall it wither before any other herbe."
Job,8,13,"So are the paths of al that forget God, and the hypocrites hope shall perish."
Job,8,14,"His confidence also shalbe cut off, and his trust shalbe as the house of a spyder."
Job,8,15,"He shall leane vpon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall holde him fast by it, yet shall it not endure."
Job,8,16,"The tree is greene before the sunne, and the branches spread ouer the garden thereof."
Job,8,17,"The rootes thereof are wrapped about the fountaine, and are folden about ye house of stones."
Job,8,18,"If any plucke it from his place, and it denie, saying, I haue not seene thee,"
Job,8,19,"Beholde, it will reioyce by this meanes, that it may growe in another molde."
Job,8,20,"Behold, God will not cast away an vpright man, neither will he take the wicked by the hand,"
Job,8,21,"Till he haue filled thy mouth with laughter, and thy lippes with ioy."
Job,8,22,"They that hate thee, shall be clothed with shame, and the dwelling of the wicked shall not remaine."
Job,9,1,"Then Iob answered, and sayd,"
Job,9,2,"I knowe verily that it is so: for howe should man compared vnto God, be iustified?"
Job,9,3,"If I would dispute with him, hee could not answere him one thing of a thousand."
Job,9,4,"He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath bene fierce against him and hath prospered?"
Job,9,5,"He remoueth the mountaines, and they feele not when he ouerthroweth them in his wrath."
Job,9,6,"Hee remooueth the earth out of her place, that the pillars thereof doe shake."
Job,9,7,"He commandeth the sunne, and it riseth not: hee closeth vp the starres, as vnder a signet."
Job,9,8,"Hee himselfe alone spreadeth out the heauens, and walketh vpon the height of the sea."
Job,9,9,"He maketh the starres Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the climates of the South."
Job,9,10,"He doeth great things, and vnsearcheable: yea, marueilous things without nomber."
Job,9,11,"Lo, when he goeth by me, I see him not: and when he passeth by, I perceiue him not."
Job,9,12,"Behold, when he taketh a pray, who can make him to restore it? who shall say vnto him, What doest thou?"
Job,9,13,"God will not withdrawe his anger, and the most mightie helpes doe stoupe vnder him."
Job,9,14,Howe much lesse shall I answere him? or howe should I finde out my words with him?
Job,9,15,"For though I were iust, yet could I not answere, but I would make supplication to my Iudge."
Job,9,16,"If I cry, and he answere me, yet woulde I not beleeue, that he heard my voyce."
Job,9,17,"For he destroyeth mee with a tempest, and woundeth me without cause."
Job,9,18,"He wil not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitternesse."
Job,9,19,"If we speake of strength, behold, he is strog: if we speake of iudgement, who shall bring me in to pleade?"
Job,9,20,"If I woulde iustifie my selfe, mine owne mouth shall condemne mee: if I would be perfite, he shall iudge me wicked."
Job,9,21,"Though I were perfite, yet I knowe not my soule: therefore abhorre I my life."
Job,9,22,"This is one point: therefore I said, Hee destroyeth the perfite and the wicked."
Job,9,23,"If the scourge should suddenly slay, should God laugh at the punishment of the innocent?"
Job,9,24,"The earth is giuen into the hand of ye wicked: he couereth the faces of the iudges therof: if not, where is he? or who is he?"
Job,9,25,"My dayes haue bene more swift then a post: they haue fled, and haue seene no good thing."
Job,9,26,"They are passed as with the most swift ships, and as the eagle that flyeth to the pray."
Job,9,27,"If I say, I wil forget my complaynt, I will cease from my wrath, and comfort mee,"
Job,9,28,"Then I am afrayd of all my sorowes, knowing that thou wilt not iudge me innocent."
Job,9,29,"If I be wicked, why labour I thus in vaine?"
Job,9,30,"If I wash my selfe with snowe water, and purge mine hands most cleane,"
Job,9,31,"Yet shalt thou plunge mee in the pit, and mine owne clothes shall make me filthie."
Job,9,32,"For he is not a man as I am, that I shoulde answere him, if we come together to iudgement."
Job,9,33,Neyther is there any vmpire that might lay his hand vpon vs both.
Job,9,34,"Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his feare astonish me:"
Job,9,35,"Then will I speake, and feare him not: but because I am not so, I holde me still."
Job,10,1,"My soule is cut off though I liue: I wil leaue my complaint vpon my selfe, and wil speake in the bitternesse of my soule."
Job,10,2,"I will say vnto God, Condemne mee not: shew me, wherefore thou contendest with mee."
Job,10,3,"Thinkest thou it good to oppresse me, and to cast off the labour of thine handes, and to fauour the counsel of the wicked?"
Job,10,4,Hast thou carnall eyes? or doest thou see as man seeth?
Job,10,5,"Are thy dayes as mans dayes? or thy yeres, as the time of man,"
Job,10,6,"That thou inquirest of mine iniquitie, and searchest out my sinne?"
Job,10,7,Thou knowest that I can not do wickedly: for none can deliuer me out of thine hand.
Job,10,8,"Thine handes haue made me, and fashioned mee wholy rounde about, and wilt thou destroy me?"
Job,10,9,"Remember, I pray thee, that thou hast made me as the clay, and wilt thou bring me into dust againe?"
Job,10,10,Hast thou not powred me out as milke? and turned me to cruds like cheese?
Job,10,11,"Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and ioyned me together with bones and sinewes."
Job,10,12,"Thou hast giuen me life, and grace: and thy visitation hath preserued my spirit."
Job,10,13,"Though thou hast hid these things in thine heart, yet I knowe that it is so with thee."
Job,10,14,"If I haue sinned, then thou wilt streightly looke vnto me, and wilt not holde mee giltlesse of mine iniquitie."
Job,10,15,"If I haue done wickedly, wo vnto me: if I haue done righteously, I will not lift vp mine head, being full of confusion, because I see mine affliction."
Job,10,16,But let it increase: hunt thou me as a lyon: returne and shew thy selfe marueilous vpon me.
Job,10,17,"Thou renuest thy plagues against me, and thou increasest thy wrath against me: changes and armies of sorowes are against me."
Job,10,18,"Wherfore then hast thou brought me out of the wombe? Oh that I had perished, and that none eye had seene me!"
Job,10,19,"And that I were as I had not bene, but brought from the wombe to the graue!"
Job,10,20,"Are not my dayes fewe? let him cease, and leaue off from me, that I may take a litle comfort,"
Job,10,21,"Before I goe and shall not returne, euen to the land of darkenesse and shadow of death:"
Job,10,22,"Into a land, I say, darke as darknes it selfe, and into the shadow of death, where is none order, but the light is there as darkenesse."

Job,31,29,"If I reioyced at his destruction that hated me, or was mooued to ioye when euill came vpon him,"
Job,31,30,"Neither haue I suffred my mouth to sinne, by wishing a curse vnto his soule."
Job,31,31,"Did not the men of my Tabernacle say, Who shall giue vs of his flesh? we can not bee satisfied."
Job,31,32,"The stranger did not lodge in the streete, but I opened my doores vnto him, that went by the way."
Job,31,33,"If I haue hid my sinne, as Adam, concealing mine iniquitie in my bosome,"
Job,31,34,"Though I could haue made afraid a great multitude, yet the most contemptible of the families did feare me: so I kept silence, and went not out of the doore."
Job,31,35,"Oh that I had some to heare me! beholde my signe that the Almightie will witnesse for me: though mine aduersary should write a booke against me,"
Job,31,36,"Woulde not I take it vpon my shoulder, and binde it as a crowne vnto me?"
Job,31,37,"I will tell him the nomber of my goings, and goe vnto him as to a prince."
Job,31,38,"If my lande cry against me, or the furrowes thereof complayne together,"
Job,31,39,"If I haue eaten the fruites thereof without siluer: or if I haue grieued the soules of the masters thereof,"
Job,31,40,"Let thistles growe in steade of wheate, and cockle in the stead of Barley. The wordes of Iob are ended."
Job,32,1,"So these three men ceased to answere Iob, because he esteemed himselfe iust."
Job,32,2,"Then the wrath of Elihu the sonne of Barachel the Buzite, of the familie of Ram, was kindled: his wrath, I say, was kindled against Iob, because he iustified himselfe more then God."
Job,32,3,"Also his anger was kindled against his three friends, because they could not finde an answere, and yet condemned Iob."
Job,32,4,(Now Elihu had wayted til Iob had spoken: for they were more ancient in yeeres then he)
Job,32,5,"So when Elihu saw, that there was none answere in the mouth of the three men, his wrath was kindled."
Job,32,6,"Therefore Elihu the sonne of Barachel, the Buzite answered, and sayd, I am yong in yeres, and ye are ancient: therefore I doubted, and was afraide to shewe you mine opinion."
Job,32,7,"For I said, The dayes shall speake, and the multitude of yeeres shall teach wisedome."
Job,32,8,"Surely there is a spirite in man, but the inspiration of the Almightie giueth vnderstanding."
Job,32,9,"Great men are not alway wise, neither doe the aged alway vnderstand iudgement."
Job,32,10,"Therefore I say, Heare me, and I will shew also mine opinion."
Job,32,11,"Behold, I did waite vpon your wordes, and hearkened vnto your knowledge, whiles you sought out reasons."
Job,32,12,"Yea, when I had considered you, lo, there was none of you that reproued Iob, nor answered his wordes:"
Job,32,13,"Lest ye should say, We haue found wisedome: for God hath cast him downe, and no man."
Job,32,14,"Yet hath he not directed his words to me, neyther will I answere him by your wordes."
Job,32,15,"Then they fearing, answered no more, but left off their talke."
Job,32,16,"When I had wayted (for they spake not, but stood still and answered no more)"
Job,32,17,"Then answered I in my turne, and I shewed mine opinion."
Job,32,18,"For I am full of matter, and the spirite within me compelleth me."
Job,32,19,"Beholde, my belly is as the wine, which hath no vent, and like the new bottels that brast."
Job,32,20,"Therefore will I speake, that I may take breath: I will open my lippes, and will answere."
Job,32,21,"I will not now accept the person of man, neyther will I giue titles to man."
Job,32,22,"For I may not giue titles, lest my Maker should take me away suddenly."
Job,33,1,"Wherefore, Iob, I pray thee, heare my talke and hearken vnto all my wordes."
Job,33,2,"Beholde now, I haue opened my mouth: my tongue hath spoken in my mouth."
Job,33,3,"My words are in the vprightnesse of mine heart, and my lippes shall speake pure knowledge."
Job,33,4,"The Spirite of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almightie hath giuen me life."
Job,33,5,"If thou canst giue me answere, prepare thy selfe and stand before me."
Job,33,6,"Beholde, I am according to thy wish in Gods stead: I am also formed of the clay."
Job,33,7,"Beholde, my terrour shall not feare thee, neither shall mine hand be heauie vpon thee."
Job,33,8,"Doubtles thou hast spoken in mine eares, and I haue heard the voyce of thy wordes."
Job,33,9,"I am cleane, without sinne: I am innocent, and there is none iniquitie in me."
Job,33,10,"Lo, he hath found occasions against me, and counted me for his enemie."
Job,33,11,"He hath put my feete in the stockes, and looketh narrowly vnto all my paths."
Job,33,12,"Behold, in this hast thou not done right: I will answere thee, that God is greater then man."
Job,33,13,Why doest thou striue against him? for he doeth not giue account of all his matters.
Job,33,14,"For God speaketh once or twise, and one seeth it not."
Job,33,15,"In dreames and visions of the night, when sleepe falleth vpon men, and they sleepe vpon their beds,"
Job,33,16,"Then he openeth the eares of men, euen by their corrections, which he had sealed,"
Job,33,17,"That he might cause man to turne away from his enterprise, and that he might hide the pride of man,"
Job,33,18,"And keepe backe his soule from the pit, and that his life should not passe by the sword."
Job,33,19,"He is also striken with sorow vpon his bed, and the griefe of his bones is sore,"
Job,33,20,"So that his life causeth him to abhorre bread, and his soule daintie meate."
Job,33,21,"His flesh faileth that it can not be seene, and his bones which were not seene, clatter."
Job,33,22,"So his soule draweth to the graue, and his life to the buriers."
Job,33,23,"If there be a messenger with him, or an interpreter, one of a thousand to declare vnto man his righteousnesse,"
Job,33,24,"Then will he haue mercie vpon him, and will say, Deliuer him, that he go not downe into the pit: for I haue receiued a reconciliation."
Job,33,25,"Then shall his flesh be as fresh as a childes, and shall returne as in the dayes of his youth."
Job,33,26,"He shall pray vnto God, and he will be fauourable vnto him, and he shall see his face with ioy: for he will render vnto man his righteousnes."
Job,33,27,"He looketh vpon men, and if one say, I haue sinned, and peruerted righteousnesse, and it did not profite me,"
Job,33,28,"He will deliuer his soule from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light."
Job,33,29,"Lo, all these things will God worke twise or thrise with a man,"
Job,33,30,"That he may turne backe his soule from the pit, to be illuminate in the light of the liuing."
Job,33,31,"Marke well, O Iob, and heare me: keepe silence, and I will speake."
Job,33,32,"If there be matter, answere me, and speak: for I desire to iustifie thee."
Job,33,33,"If thou hast not, heare me: holde thy tongue, and I will teach thee wisedome."
Job,34,1,"Moreouer Elihu answered, and saide,"
Job,34,2,"Heare my wordes, ye wise men, and hearken vnto me, ye that haue knowledge."
Job,34,3,"For the eare tryeth the words, as the mouth tasteth meate."
Job,34,4,"Let vs seeke iudgement among vs, and let vs knowe among our selues what is good."
Job,34,5,"For Iob hath saide, I am righteous, and God hath taken away my iudgement."
Job,34,6,Should I lye in my right? my wound of the arrowe is grieuous without my sinne.
Job,34,7,"What man is like Iob, that drinketh scornfulnesse like water?"
Job,34,8,"Which goeth in the companie of them that worke iniquitie, and walketh with wicked men?"
Job,34,9,"For he hath saide, It profiteth a man nothing that he should walke with God."
Job,34,10,"Therefore hearken vnto me, ye men of wisedome, God forbid that wickednesse should be in God, and iniquitie in the Almightie."
Job,34,11,"For he will render vnto man according to his worke, and cause euery one to finde according to his way."
Job,34,12,"And certainely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almightie peruert iudgement."
Job,34,13,Whome hath he appointed ouer the earth beside him selfe? or who hath placed the whole worlde?
Job,34,14,"If he set his heart vpon man, and gather vnto him selfe his spirit and his breath,"
Job,34,15,"All flesh shall perish together, and man shall returne vnto dust."
Job,34,16,"And if thou hast vnderstanding, heare this and hearken to the voyce of my wordes."
Job,34,17,"Shal he that hateth iudgement, gouerne? and wilt thou iudge him wicked that is most iust?"
Job,34,18,"Wilt thou say vnto a King, Thou art wicked? or to princes, Ye are vngodly?"
Job,34,19,"How much lesse to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, and regardeth not the rich, more then the poore? for they be all the worke of his handes."
Job,34,20,"They shall die suddenly, and the people shalbe troubled at midnight, and they shall passe foorth and take away the mightie without hand."
Job,34,21,"For his eyes are vpon the wayes of man, and he seeth all his goings."
Job,34,22,"There is no darkenesse nor shadowe of death, that the workers of iniquitie might be hid therein."
Job,34,23,"For he will not lay on man so much, that he should enter into iudgement with God."
Job,34,24,"He shall breake the mightie without seeking, and shall set vp other in their stead."
Job,34,25,"Therefore shall he declare their works: he shall turne the night, and they shalbe destroyed."
Job,34,26,"He striketh them as wicked men in the places of the seers,"
Job,34,27,"Because they haue turned backe from him, and would not consider all his wayes:"
Job,34,28,"So that they haue caused the voyce of the poore to come vnto him, and he hath heard the cry of the afflicted."
Job,34,29,"And when he giueth quietnesse, who can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who can beholde him, whether it be vpon nations, or vpon a man onely?"
Job,34,30,"Because the hypocrite doeth reigne, and because the people are snared."
Job,34,31,"Surely it appertaineth vnto God to say, I haue pardoned, I will not destroy."
Job,34,32,"But if I see not, teach thou me: if I haue done wickedly, I will doe no more."
Job,34,33,"Wil he performe the thing through thee? for thou hast reproued it, because that thou hast chosen, and not I. now speake what thou knowest."
Job,34,34,"Let men of vnderstanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken vnto me."
Job,34,35,"Iob hath not spoken of knowledge, neyther were his wordes according to wisedome."
Job,34,36,"I desire that Iob may be tryed, vnto the ende touching the answeres for wicked men."
Job,34,37,"For he addeth rebellion vnto his sinne: he clappeth his handes among vs, and multiplieth his wordes against God."
Job,35,1,"Elihu spake moreouer, and said,"
Job,35,2,"Thinkest thou this right, that thou hast said, I am more righteous then God?"
Job,35,3,"For thou hast said, What profiteth it thee and what auaileth it me, to purge me from my sinne?"
Job,35,4,"Therefore will I answere thee, and thy companions with thee."
Job,35,5,"Looke vnto the heauen, and see and behold the cloudes which are hyer then thou."
Job,35,6,"If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him, yea, when thy sinnes be many, what doest thou vnto him?"
Job,35,7,"If thou be righteous, what giuest thou vnto him? or what receiueth he at thine hand?"
Job,35,8,Thy wickednesse may hurt a man as thou art: and thy righteousnes may profite ye sonne of man.
Job,35,9,"They cause many that are oppressed, to crye, which crye out for ye violence of the mightie."
Job,35,10,"But none saieth, Where is God that made me, which giueth songs in the nyght?"
Job,35,11,"Which teacheth vs more then the beastes of the earth, and giueth vs more wisdome then the foules of the heauen."
Job,35,12,"Then they crye because of the violence of the wicked, but he answereth not."
Job,35,13,"Surely God will not heare vanitie, neyther will the Almightie regard it."
Job,35,14,"Although thou sayest to God, Thou wilt not regard it, yet iudgement is before him: trust thou in him."
Job,35,15,"But nowe because his anger hath not visited, nor called to count the euill with great extremitie,"
Job,35,16,"Therfore Iob openeth his mouth in vaine, and multiplieth wordes without knowledge."
Job,36,1,"Elihu also proceeded and sayde,"
Job,36,2,"Suffer me a litle, and I will instruct thee: for I haue yet to speake on Gods behalfe."
Job,36,3,"I will fetche my knowledge afarre off, and will attribute righteousnes vnto my Maker."
Job,36,4,"For truely my wordes shall not be false, and he that is perfect in knowledge, speaketh with thee."
Job,36,5,"Behold, the mighty God casteth away none that is mighty and valiant of courage."
Job,36,6,"He mainteineth not the wicked, but he giueth iudgement to the afflicted."
Job,36,7,"He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous, but they are with Kings in ye throne, where he placeth them for euer: thus they are exalted."
Job,36,8,"And if they bee bound in fetters and tyed with the cordes of affliction,"
Job,36,9,"Then will he shewe them their worke and their sinnes, because they haue bene proude."
Job,36,10,"He openeth also their eare to discipline, and commandeth them that they returne from iniquity."
Job,36,11,"If they obey and serue him, they shall end their dayes in prosperity, and their yeres in pleasures."
Job,36,12,"But if they wil not obey, they shall passe by the sworde, and perish without knowledge."
Job,36,13,But the hypocrites of heart increase the wrath: for they call not when he bindeth them.
Job,36,14,"Their soule dyeth in youth, and their life among the whoremongers."
Job,36,15,"He deliuereth the poore in his affliction, and openeth their eare in trouble."
Job,36,16,"Euen so woulde he haue taken thee out of the streight place into a broade place and not shut vp beneath: and that which resteth vpon thy table, had bene full of fat."
Job,36,17,"But thou art ful of the iudgement of the wicked, though iudgement and equitie maintaine all things."
Job,36,18,"For Gods wrath is, least hee should take that away in thine abundance: for no multitude of giftes can deliuer thee."
Job,36,19,"Wil he regard thy riches? he regardeth not golde, nor all them that excel in strength."
Job,36,20,"Be not carefull in the night, howe he destroyeth the people out of their place."
Job,36,21,Take thou heede: looke not to iniquitie: for thou hast chosen it rather then affliction.
Job,36,22,"Beholde, God exalteth by his power: what teacher is like him?"
Job,36,23,"Who hath appointed to him his way? or who can say, Thou hast done wickedly?"
Job,36,24,"Remember that thou magnifie his worke, which men behold."
Job,36,25,"All men see it, and men beholde it afarre off."
Job,36,26,"Beholde, God is excellent, and we knowe him not, neither can the nomber of his yeres bee searched out."
Job,36,27,"When he restraineth the droppes of water, the rayne powreth down by the vapour thereof,"
Job,36,28,Which raine the cloudes do droppe and let fall abundantly vpon man.
Job,36,29,Who can know the diuisions of ye clouds and the thunders of his tabernacle?
Job,36,30,"Beholde, he spreadeth his light vpon it, and couereth the bottome of the sea."
Job,36,31,"For thereby hee iudgeth the people, and giueth meate abundantly."
Job,36,32,"He couereth the light with the clouds, and commandeth them to go against it."
Job,36,33,"His companion sheweth him thereof, and there is anger in rising vp."
Job,37,1,"At this also mine heart is astonied, and is mooued out of his place."
Job,37,2,"Heare the sound of his voyce, and the noyse that goeth out of his mouth."
Job,37,3,"He directeth it vnder the whole heauen, and his light vnto the endes of the world."
Job,37,4,"After it a noyse soundeth: hee thundereth with the voyce of his maiestie, and hee will not stay them when his voyce is heard."
Job,37,5,"God thundereth marueilously with his voyce: he worketh great things, which we know not."
Job,37,6,"For he sayth to the snowe, Be thou vpon the earth: likewise to the small rayne and to the great rayne of his power."
Job,37,7,"With the force thereof he shutteth vp euery man, that all men may knowe his worke."
Job,37,8,"Then the beastes go into the denne, and remaine in their places."
Job,37,9,"The whirlewind commeth out of the South, and the colde from the North winde."
Job,37,10,"At the breath of God the frost is giuen, and the breadth of the waters is made narrowe."
Job,37,11,"He maketh also the cloudes to labour, to water the earth, and scattereth the cloude of his light."
Job,37,12,"And it is turned about by his gouernment, that they may doe whatsoeuer he commandeth them vpon the whole worlde:"
Job,37,13,"Whether it be for punishment, or for his lande, or of mercie, he causeth it to come."
Job,37,14,"Hearken vnto this, O Iob: stand and consider the wonderous workes of God."
Job,37,15,Diddest thou knowe when God disposed them? and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
Job,37,16,"Hast thou knowen the varietie of the cloude, and the wonderous workes of him, that is perfite in knowledge?"
Job,37,17,"Or howe thy clothes are warme, when he maketh the earth quiet through the South winde?"
Job,37,18,"Hast thou stretched out the heaues, which are strong, and as a molten glasse?"
Job,37,19,Tell vs what we shall say vnto him: for we can not dispose our matter because of darknes.
Job,37,20,Shall it be told him when I speake? or shall man speake when he shalbe destroyed?
Job,37,21,"And nowe men see not the light, which shineth in the cloudes, but the winde passeth and clenseth them."
Job,37,22,"The brightnesse commeth out of the North: the praise thereof is to God, which is terrible."
Job,37,23,"It is the Almightie: we can not finde him out: he is excellent in power and iudgement, and aboundant in iustice: he afflicteth not."
Job,37,24,Let men therefore feare him: for he will not regarde any that are wise in their owne conceit.
Job,38,1,"Then answered the Lord vnto Iob out of the whirle winde, and said,"
Job,38,2,Who is this that darkeneth the counsell by wordes without knowledge?
Job,38,3,Girde vp nowe thy loynes like a man: I will demande of thee and declare thou vnto me.
Job,38,4,"Where wast thou when I layd the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast vnderstanding,"
Job,38,5,"Who hath layde the measures thereof, if thou knowest, or who hath stretched the line ouer it:"
Job,38,6,Whereupon are the foundations thereof set: or who layed the corner stone thereof:
Job,38,7,"When the starres of the morning praysed me together, and all the children of God reioyced:"
Job,38,8,"Or who hath shut vp the Sea with doores, when it yssued and came foorth as out of the wombe:"
Job,38,9,"When I made the cloudes as a couering thereof, and darkenesse as the swadeling bands thereof:"
Job,38,10,"When I stablished my commandement vpon it, and set barres and doores,"
Job,38,11,"And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no farther, and here shall it stay thy proude waues."
Job,38,12,"Hast thou commanded the morning since thy dayes? hast thou caused the morning to knowe his place,"
Job,38,13,"That it might take hold of the corners of the earth, and that the wicked might be shaken out of it?"
Job,38,14,"It is turned as clay to facion, and all stand vp as a garment."
Job,38,15,"And from the wicked their light shall be taken away, and the hie arme shalbe broken."
Job,38,16,Hast thou entred into the bottomes of the sea? or hast thou walked to seeke out the depth?
Job,38,17,Haue the gates of death bene opened vnto thee? or hast thou seene the gates of the shadowe of death?
Job,38,18,Hast thou perceiued the breadth of the earth? tell if thou knowest all this.
Job,38,19,"Where is the way where light dwelleth? and where is the place of darkenesse,"
Job,38,20,"That thou shouldest receiue it in the boundes thereof, and that thou shouldest knowe the paths to the house thereof?"
Job,38,21,"Knewest thou it, because thou wast then borne, and because the nomber of thy dayes is great?"
Job,38,22,"Hast thou entred into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seene the treasures of ye haile,"
Job,38,23,"Which I haue hid against the time of trouble, against the day of warre and battell?"
Job,38,24,"By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the East winde vpon the earth?"
Job,38,25,"Who hath deuided the spowtes for the raine? or the way for the lightning of ye thunders,"
Job,38,26,"To cause it to raine on the earth where no man is, and in the wildernes where there is no man?"
Job,38,27,"To fulfil the wilde and waste place, and to cause the bud of the herbe to spring forth?"
Job,38,28,Who is the father of the rayne? or who hath begotten the droppes of the dewe?
Job,38,29,Out of whose wombe came the yee? who hath ingendred the frost of the heauen?
Job,38,30,The waters are hid as with a stone: and the face of the depth is frosen.
Job,38,31,Canst thou restraine the sweete influences of the Pleiades? or loose the bandes of Orion?
Job,38,32,Canst thou bring foorth Mazzaroth in their time? canst thou also guide Arcturus with his sonnes?
Job,38,33,"Knowest thou the course of heauen, or canst thou set the rule thereof in the earth?"
Job,38,34,Canst thou lift vp thy voice to the cloudes that the aboundance of water may couer thee?
Job,38,35,"Canst thou sende the lightenings that they may walke, and say vnto thee, Loe, heere we are?"
Job,38,36,Who hath put wisedome in the reines? or who hath giuen the heart vnderstanding?
Job,38,37,"Who can nomber cloudes by wisedome? or who can cause to cease the bottels of heaue,"
Job,38,38,"When the earth groweth into hardnesse, and the clottes are fast together?"
Job,39,1,"Wilt thou hunt the pray for the lyon? or fill the appetite of the lyons whelpes,"
Job,39,2,"When they couch in their places, and remaine in the couert to lye in waite?"
Job,39,3,"Who prepareth for the rauen his meate, when his birdes crie vnto God, wandering for lacke of meate?"
Job,39,4,Knowest thou the time when the wilde goates bring foorth yong? or doest thou marke when the hindes doe calue?
Job,39,5,Canst thou nomber the moneths that they fulfill? or knowest thou the time when they bring foorth?
Job,39,6,They bow them selues: they bruise their yong and cast out their sorowes.
Job,39,7,"Yet their yong waxe fatte, and growe vp with corne: they goe foorth and returne not vnto them."
Job,39,8,Who hath set the wilde asse at libertie? or who hath loosed the bondes of the wilde asse?
Job,39,9,"It is I which haue made the wildernesse his house, and the salt places his dwellings."
Job,39,10,He derideth the multitude of the citie: he heareth not the crie of the driuer.
Job,39,11,"He seeketh out the mountaine for his pasture, and searcheth after euery greene thing."
Job,39,12,Will the vnicorne serue thee? or will he tary by thy cribbe?
Job,39,13,Canst thou binde the vnicorne with his band to labour in the furrowe? or will he plowe the valleyes after thee?
Job,39,14,"Wilt thou trust in him, because his strength is great, and cast off thy labour vnto him?"
Job,39,15,"Wilt thou beleeue him, that he will bring home thy seede, and gather it vnto thy barne?"
Job,39,16,Hast thou giuen the pleasant wings vnto the peacockes? or winges and feathers vnto the ostriche?
Job,39,17,"Which leaueth his egges in the earth, and maketh them hote in the dust,"
Job,39,18,"And forgetteth that the foote might scatter the, or that the wild beast might breake the."
Job,39,19,"He sheweth himselfe cruell vnto his yong ones, as they were not his, and is without feare, as if he trauailed in vaine."
Job,39,20,"For God had depriued him of wisedom, and hath giuen him no part of vnderstanding."
Job,39,21,"When time is, he mounteth on hie: he mocketh the horse and his rider."
Job,39,22,Hast thou giuen the horse strength? or couered his necke with neying?
Job,39,23,Hast thou made him afraid as the grashopper? his strong neying is fearefull.
Job,39,24,"He diggeth in the valley, and reioyceth in his strength: he goeth foorth to meete the harnest man."
Job,39,25,"He mocketh at feare, and is not afraid, and turneth not backe from the sworde,"
Job,39,26,"Though the quiuer rattle against him, the glittering speare and the shield."
Job,39,27,"He swalloweth the ground for fearcenes and rage, and he beleeueth not that it is the noise of the trumpet."
Job,39,28,"He sayth among the trumpets, Ha, ha: hee smellleth the battell afarre off, and the noyse of the captaines, and the shouting."
Job,39,29,"Shall the hauke flie by thy wisedome, stretching out his wings toward the South?"
Job,39,30,"Doeth the eagle mount vp at thy commandement, or make his nest on hie?"
Job,39,31,"Shee abideth and remaineth in the rocke, euen vpon the toppe of the rocke, and the tower."
Job,39,32,"From thence she spieth for meate, and her eyes beholde afarre off."
Job,39,33,"His young ones also sucke vp blood: and where the slaine are, there is she."
Job,39,34,"Moreouer ye Lord spake vnto Iob, and said,"
Job,39,35,"Is this to learne to striue with the Almightie? he that reprooueth God, let him answere to it."
Job,39,36,"Then Iob answered the Lord, saying,"
Job,39,37,"Beholde, I am vile: what shall I answere thee? I will lay mine hand vpon my mouth."
