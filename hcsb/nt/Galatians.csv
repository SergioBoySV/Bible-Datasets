Galatians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle — not from men or by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead —"
Galatians,1,2,and all the brothers who are with me: To the churches of Galatia.
Galatians,1,3,"Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,"
Galatians,1,4,"who gave Himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father."
Galatians,1,5,To whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Galatians,1,6,I am amazed that you are so quickly turning away from Him who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel —
Galatians,1,7,"not that there is another gospel, but there are some who are troubling you and want to change the good news about the Messiah."
Galatians,1,8,"But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel other than what we have preached to you, a curse be on him!"
Galatians,1,9,"As we have said before, I now say again: If anyone preaches to you a gospel contrary to what you received, a curse be on him!"
Galatians,1,10,"For am I now trying to win the favor of people, or God? Or am I striving to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ."
Galatians,1,11,"Now I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel preached by me is not based on human thought."
Galatians,1,12,"For I did not receive it from a human source and I was not taught it, but it came by a revelation from Jesus Christ."
Galatians,1,13,For you have heard about my former way of life in Judaism: I persecuted God’s church to an extreme degree and tried to destroy it.
Galatians,1,14,"I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries among my people, because I was extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors."
Galatians,1,15,"But when God, who from my birth set me apart and called me by His grace, was pleased"
Galatians,1,16,"to reveal His Son in me, so that I could preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone."
Galatians,1,17,I did not go up to Jerusalem to those who had become apostles before me; instead I went to Arabia and came back to Damascus.
Galatians,1,18,"Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to get to know Cephas, and I stayed with him 15 days."
Galatians,1,19,"But I didn’t see any of the other apostles except James, the Lord’s brother."
Galatians,1,20,Now I am not lying in what I write to you. God is my witness.
Galatians,1,21,"Afterward, I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia."
Galatians,1,22,I remained personally unknown to the Judean churches in Christ;
Galatians,1,23,they simply kept hearing: “He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith he once tried to destroy.”
Galatians,1,24,And they glorified God because of me.
Galatians,2,1,"Then after 14 years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also."
Galatians,2,2,"I went up according to a revelation and presented to them the gospel I preach among the Gentiles — but privately to those recognized as leaders — so that I might not be running, or have run the race, in vain."
Galatians,2,3,"But not even Titus who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised."
Galatians,2,4,"This issue arose because of false brothers smuggled in, who came in secretly to spy on the freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, in order to enslave us."
Galatians,2,5,"But we did not give up and submit to these people for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel would be preserved for you."
Galatians,2,6,Now from those recognized as important (what they really were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism ) — they added nothing to me.
Galatians,2,7,"On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter was for the circumcised,"
Galatians,2,8,since the One at work in Peter for an apostleship to the circumcised was also at work in me for the Gentiles.
Galatians,2,9,"When James, Cephas, and John, recognized as pillars, acknowledged the grace that had been given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to me and Barnabas, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised."
Galatians,2,10,"They asked only that we would remember the poor, which I made every effort to do."
Galatians,2,11,"But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned."
Galatians,2,12,"For he regularly ate with the Gentiles before certain men came from James. However, when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, because he feared those from the circumcision party."
Galatians,2,13,"Then the rest of the Jews joined his hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy."
Galatians,2,14,"But when I saw that they were deviating from the truth of the gospel, I told Cephas in front of everyone, “If you, who are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel Gentiles to live like Jews? ”"
Galatians,2,15,We who are Jews by birth and not “Gentile sinners”
Galatians,2,16,"know that no one is justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ. And we have believed in Christ Jesus so that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no human being will be justified."
Galatians,2,17,"But if we ourselves are also found to be “sinners” while seeking to be justified by Christ, is Christ then a promoter of sin? Absolutely not!"
Galatians,2,18,"If I rebuild the system I tore down, I show myself to be a lawbreaker."
Galatians,2,19,"For through the law I have died to the law, so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ"
Galatians,2,20,"and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me."
Galatians,2,21,"I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing."
Galatians,3,1,"You foolish Galatians! Who has hypnotized you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was vividly portrayed as crucified?"
Galatians,3,2,I only want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?
Galatians,3,3,"Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now going to be made complete by the flesh?"
Galatians,3,4,Did you suffer so much for nothing — if in fact it was for nothing?
Galatians,3,5,"So then, does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law or by hearing with faith?"
Galatians,3,6,"Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness,"
Galatians,3,7,then understand that those who have faith are Abraham’s sons.
Galatians,3,8,"Now the Scripture saw in advance that God would justify the Gentiles by faith and told the good news ahead of time to Abraham, saying, All the nations will be blessed through you."
Galatians,3,9,"So those who have faith are blessed with Abraham, who had faith."
Galatians,3,10,"For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, because it is written: Everyone who does not continue doing everything written in the book of the law is cursed."
Galatians,3,11,"Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because the righteous will live by faith."
Galatians,3,12,"But the law is not based on faith; instead, the one who does these things will live by them."
Galatians,3,13,"Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, because it is written: Everyone who is hung on a tree is cursed."
Galatians,3,14,"The purpose was that the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles by Christ Jesus, so that we could receive the promised Spirit through faith."
Galatians,3,15,"Brothers, I’m using a human illustration. No one sets aside or makes additions to even a human covenant that has been ratified."
Galatians,3,16,"Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say “and to seeds,” as though referring to many, but referring to one, and to your seed, who is Christ."
Galatians,3,17,"And I say this: The law, which came 430 years later, does not revoke a covenant that was previously ratified by God and cancel the promise."
Galatians,3,18,"For if the inheritance is from the law, it is no longer from the promise; but God granted it to Abraham through the promise."
Galatians,3,19,Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise was made would come. The law was put into effect through angels by means of a mediator.
Galatians,3,20,"Now a mediator is not for just one person, but God is one."
Galatians,3,21,"Is the law therefore contrary to God’s promises? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, then righteousness would certainly be by the law."
Galatians,3,22,"But the Scripture has imprisoned everything under sin’s power, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe."
Galatians,3,23,"Before this faith came, we were confined under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith was revealed."
Galatians,3,24,"The law, then, was our guardian until Christ, so that we could be justified by faith."
Galatians,3,25,"But since that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian,"
Galatians,3,26,for you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
Galatians,3,27,For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ like a garment.
Galatians,3,28,"There is no Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
Galatians,3,29,"And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to the promise."
Galatians,4,1,"Now I say that as long as the heir is a child, he differs in no way from a slave, though he is the owner of everything."
Galatians,4,2,"Instead, he is under guardians and stewards until the time set by his father."
Galatians,4,3,"In the same way we also, when we were children, were in slavery under the elemental forces of the world."
Galatians,4,4,"When the time came to completion, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the law,"
Galatians,4,5,"to redeem those under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons."
Galatians,4,6,"And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, “ Abba, Father! ”"
Galatians,4,7,"So you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God."
Galatians,4,8,"But in the past, when you didn’t know God, you were enslaved to things that by nature are not gods."
Galatians,4,9,"But now, since you know God, or rather have become known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and bankrupt elemental forces? Do you want to be enslaved to them all over again?"
Galatians,4,10,"You observe special days, months, seasons, and years."
Galatians,4,11,"I am fearful for you, that perhaps my labor for you has been wasted."
Galatians,4,12,"I beg you, brothers: Become like me, for I also became like you. You have not wronged me;"
Galatians,4,13,you know that previously I preached the gospel to you because of a physical illness.
Galatians,4,14,"You did not despise or reject me though my physical condition was a trial for you. On the contrary, you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus Himself."
Galatians,4,15,"What happened to this sense of being blessed you had? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me."
Galatians,4,16,Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?
Galatians,4,17,"They are enthusiastic about you, but not for any good. Instead, they want to isolate you so you will be enthusiastic about them."
Galatians,4,18,Now it is always good to be enthusiastic about good — and not just when I am with you.
Galatians,4,19,"My children, I am again suffering labor pains for you until Christ is formed in you."
Galatians,4,20,"I would like to be with you right now and change my tone of voice, because I don’t know what to do about you."
Galatians,4,21,"Tell me, those of you who want to be under the law, don’t you hear the law?"
Galatians,4,22,"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave and the other by a free woman."
Galatians,4,23,"But the one by the slave was born according to the impulse of the flesh, while the one by the free woman was born as the result of a promise."
Galatians,4,24,"These things are illustrations, for the women represent the two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai and bears children into slavery — this is Hagar."
Galatians,4,25,"Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children."
Galatians,4,26,"But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother."
Galatians,4,27,"For it is written: Rejoice, childless woman, who does not give birth. Burst into song and shout, you who are not in labor, for the children of the desolate are many, more numerous than those of the woman who has a husband."
Galatians,4,28,"Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise."
Galatians,4,29,"But just as then the child born according to the flesh persecuted the one born according to the Spirit, so also now."
Galatians,4,30,"But what does the Scripture say? Drive out the slave and her son, for the son of the slave will never be a coheir with the son of the free woman."
Galatians,4,31,"Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman."
Galatians,5,1,Christ has liberated us to be free. Stand firm then and don’t submit again to a yoke of slavery.
Galatians,5,2,"Take note! I, Paul, tell you that if you get yourselves circumcised, Christ will not benefit you at all."
Galatians,5,3,Again I testify to every man who gets himself circumcised that he is obligated to keep the entire law.
Galatians,5,4,You who are trying to be justified by the law are alienated from Christ; you have fallen from grace.
Galatians,5,5,"For through the Spirit, by faith, we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness."
Galatians,5,6,For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision accomplishes anything; what matters is faith working through love.
Galatians,5,7,You were running well. Who prevented you from obeying the truth?
Galatians,5,8,This persuasion did not come from the One who called you.
Galatians,5,9,A little yeast leavens the whole lump of dough.
Galatians,5,10,I have confidence in the Lord you will not accept any other view. But whoever it is that is confusing you will pay the penalty.
Galatians,5,11,"Now brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished."
Galatians,5,12,I wish those who are disturbing you might also get themselves castrated!
Galatians,5,13,"For you were called to be free, brothers; only don’t use this freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but serve one another through love."
Galatians,5,14,For the entire law is fulfilled in one statement: Love your neighbor as yourself.
Galatians,5,15,"But if you bite and devour one another, watch out, or you will be consumed by one another."
Galatians,5,16,"I say then, walk by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh."
Galatians,5,17,"For the flesh desires what is against the Spirit, and the Spirit desires what is against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you don’t do what you want."
Galatians,5,18,"But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law."
Galatians,5,19,"Now the works of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, moral impurity, promiscuity,"
Galatians,5,20,"idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambitions, dissensions, factions,"
Galatians,5,21,"envy, drunkenness, carousing, and anything similar. I tell you about these things in advance — as I told you before — that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God."
Galatians,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,"
Galatians,5,23,"gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law."
Galatians,5,24,Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
Galatians,5,25,"Since we live by the Spirit, we must also follow the Spirit."
Galatians,5,26,"We must not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another."
Galatians,6,1,"Brothers, if someone is caught in any wrongdoing, you who are spiritual should restore such a person with a gentle spirit, watching out for yourselves so you also won’t be tempted."
Galatians,6,2,Carry one another’s burdens; in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
Galatians,6,3,"For if anyone considers himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself."
Galatians,6,4,"But each person should examine his own work, and then he will have a reason for boasting in himself alone, and not in respect to someone else."
Galatians,6,5,For each person will have to carry his own load.
Galatians,6,6,The one who is taught the message must share all his good things with the teacher.
Galatians,6,7,"Don’t be deceived: God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows he will also reap,"
Galatians,6,8,"because the one who sows to his flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit."
Galatians,6,9,"So we must not get tired of doing good, for we will reap at the proper time if we don’t give up."
Galatians,6,10,"Therefore, as we have opportunity, we must work for the good of all, especially for those who belong to the household of faith."
Galatians,6,11,Look at what large letters I use as I write to you in my own handwriting.
Galatians,6,12,Those who want to make a good impression in the flesh are the ones who would compel you to be circumcised — but only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.
Galatians,6,13,"For even the circumcised don’t keep the law themselves; however, they want you to be circumcised in order to boast about your flesh."
Galatians,6,14,"But as for me, I will never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. The world has been crucified to me through the cross, and I to the world."
Galatians,6,15,For both circumcision and uncircumcision mean nothing; what matters instead is a new creation.
Galatians,6,16,"May peace come to all those who follow this standard, and mercy to the Israel of God!"
Galatians,6,17,"From now on, let no one cause me trouble, because I bear on my body scars for the cause of Jesus."
Galatians,6,18,"Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
