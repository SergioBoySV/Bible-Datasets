Titus,1,1,"Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to build up the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness,"
Titus,1,2,"in the hope of eternal life that God, who cannot lie, promised before time began."
Titus,1,3,In His own time He has revealed His message in the proclamation that I was entrusted with by the command of God our Savior:
Titus,1,4,"To Titus, my true son in our common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior."
Titus,1,5,"The reason I left you in Crete was to set right what was left undone and, as I directed you, to appoint elders in every town:"
Titus,1,6,"one who is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of wildness or rebellion."
Titus,1,7,"For an overseer, as God’s administrator, must be blameless, not arrogant, not hot-tempered, not addicted to wine, not a bully, not greedy for money,"
Titus,1,8,"but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, righteous, holy, self-controlled,"
Titus,1,9,"holding to the faithful message as taught, so that he will be able both to encourage with sound teaching and to refute those who contradict it."
Titus,1,10,"For there are also many rebellious people, full of empty talk and deception, especially those from Judaism."
Titus,1,11,It is necessary to silence them; they overthrow whole households by teaching what they shouldn’t in order to get money dishonestly.
Titus,1,12,"One of their very own prophets said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."
Titus,1,13,"This testimony is true. So, rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith"
Titus,1,14,and may not pay attention to Jewish myths and the commands of men who reject the truth.
Titus,1,15,"To the pure, everything is pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; in fact, both their mind and conscience are defiled."
Titus,1,16,"They profess to know God, but they deny Him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, and disqualified for any good work."
Titus,2,1,But you must say the things that are consistent with sound teaching.
Titus,2,2,"Older men are to be level headed, worthy of respect, sensible, and sound in faith, love, and endurance."
Titus,2,3,"In the same way, older women are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not addicted to much wine. They are to teach what is good,"
Titus,2,4,"so they may encourage the young women to love their husbands and to love their children,"
Titus,2,5,"to be self-controlled, pure, homemakers, kind, and submissive to their husbands, so that God’s message will not be slandered."
Titus,2,6,"In the same way, encourage the young men to be self-controlled"
Titus,2,7,in everything. Make yourself an example of good works with integrity and dignity in your teaching.
Titus,2,8,"Your message is to be sound beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be ashamed, having nothing bad to say about us."
Titus,2,9,"Slaves are to be submissive to their masters in everything, and to be well-pleasing, not talking back"
Titus,2,10,"or stealing, but demonstrating utter faithfulness, so that they may adorn the teaching of God our Savior in everything."
Titus,2,11,"For the grace of God has appeared with salvation for all people,"
Titus,2,12,"instructing us to deny godlessness and worldly lusts and to live in a sensible, righteous, and godly way in the present age,"
Titus,2,13,"while we wait for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ."
Titus,2,14,"He gave Himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for Himself a people for His own possession, eager to do good works."
Titus,2,15,"Say these things, and encourage and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you."
Titus,3,1,"Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work,"
Titus,3,2,"to slander no one, to avoid fighting, and to be kind, always showing gentleness to all people."
Titus,3,3,"For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another."
Titus,3,4,"But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared,"
Titus,3,5,"He saved us — not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to His mercy — through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit."
Titus,3,6,He poured out this Spirit on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior
Titus,3,7,"so that, having been justified by His grace, we may become heirs with the hope of eternal life."
Titus,3,8,"This saying is trustworthy. I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed God might be careful to devote themselves to good works. These are good and profitable for everyone."
Titus,3,9,"But avoid foolish debates, genealogies, quarrels, and disputes about the law, for they are unprofitable and worthless."
Titus,3,10,"Reject a divisive person after a first and second warning,"
Titus,3,11,"knowing that such a person is perverted and sins, being self-condemned."
Titus,3,12,"When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there."
Titus,3,13,"Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey, so that they will lack nothing."
Titus,3,14,"And our people must also learn to devote themselves to good works for cases of urgent need, so that they will not be unfruitful."
Titus,3,15,All those who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you.
