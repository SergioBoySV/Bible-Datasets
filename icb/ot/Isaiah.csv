Isaiah,1,1,"This is the vision Isaiah son of Amoz saw. God showed Isaiah what would happen to Judah and Jerusalem. Isaiah saw these things while Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah were kings of Judah."
Isaiah,1,2,"Heaven and earth, listen, because the Lord is speaking: “I raised my children and helped them grow. But they have turned against me."
Isaiah,1,3,An ox knows its master. And a donkey knows where its owner feeds it. But the people of Israel do not know me. My people do not understand.”
Isaiah,1,4,"Terrible times are coming for Israel, a nation of sin. The people are loaded down with guilt. They are like a group of children doing evil. They are full of evil. They have left the Lord. They hate God, the Holy One of Israel. They have turned away from him."
Isaiah,1,5,Why should you continue to be punished? Why do you continue to turn against him? Your whole head is hurt. And your whole heart is sick.
Isaiah,1,6,"There is no healthy spot from the bottom of your foot to the top of your head. You are covered with wounds, hurts and open sores. Your wounds are not cleaned and covered. No medicine takes away the pain."
Isaiah,1,7,"Your land is ruined. Your cities have been burned with fire. While you watch, your enemies are stealing everything from your land. Your land is ruined like a country destroyed by enemies."
Isaiah,1,8,Jerusalem is left alone like an empty shelter in a vineyard. It is like a hut left in a field of melons. It is like a city surrounded by enemies.
Isaiah,1,9,The Lord of heaven’s armies allowed a few of our people to live. Otherwise we would have been completely destroyed like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.
Isaiah,1,10,"Jerusalem, your rulers are like those of Sodom. Your people are like those of Gomorrah. Hear the word of the Lord. Listen to the teachings of our God!"
Isaiah,1,11,"The Lord says, “I do not want all these sacrifices you give me. I have had enough of your sacrifices of male sheep and fat from fine animals. I am not pleased by the blood of bulls, sheep and goats."
Isaiah,1,12,You come to meet with me. But who asked you to do all this running in and out?
Isaiah,1,13,"Don’t continue bringing me worthless sacrifices! I hate the incense you burn. I can’t stand your New Moons, Sabbaths and other feast days. I can’t stand the evil you do in holding your holy meetings."
Isaiah,1,14,I hate your New Moon feasts and your other yearly feasts. They have become like heavy weights on me. I am tired of carrying them.
Isaiah,1,15,"You will raise your arms in prayer to me. But I will refuse to look at you. Even if you say many prayers, I will not listen to you. It’s because your hands are full of blood."
Isaiah,1,16,Wash yourselves and make yourselves clean. Stop doing the evil things I see you do. Stop doing wrong!
Isaiah,1,17,Learn to do good. Be fair to other people. Punish those who hurt others. Help the orphans. Stand up for the rights of widows.”
Isaiah,1,18,"The Lord says, “Come, we will talk these things over. Your sins are red like deep red cloth. But they can be as white as snow. Your sins are bright red. But you can be white like wool."
Isaiah,1,19,"If you will obey me, you will eat good crops from the land."
Isaiah,1,20,"But if you refuse to obey and if you turn against me, you will be destroyed by your enemies’ swords.” The Lord himself said these things."
Isaiah,1,21,"The city of Jerusalem once followed the Lord. But she is no longer loyal to the Lord. She used to be filled with fairness. People there lived the way God wanted. But now, murderers live there."
Isaiah,1,22,"Jerusalem, you have become like the scum left when silver is purified. You are like wine mixed with water."
Isaiah,1,23,Your rulers are rebels. They are friends of thieves. They all accept money for doing wrong things. They are paid to cheat people. They don’t try to help the orphans. And they don’t listen to the widows’ needs.
Isaiah,1,24,"The Master, the Lord of heaven’s armies, the Mighty One of Israel, says: “You, my enemies, will not cause me any more trouble. I will pay you back for what you did."
Isaiah,1,25,I will turn against you. I will clean away all your wrongs as if with soap. I will take all the worthless things out of you.
Isaiah,1,26,I will bring back judges as you had long ago. Your counselors will be like the ones you had in the beginning. Then you will be called the City That Is Right with God. You will be called the Loyal City.”
Isaiah,1,27,"Because the Lord does what is fair, he will rescue Jerusalem. Because the Lord does what is right, he will save her people who come back to him."
Isaiah,1,28,But sinners and those who turn against him will be destroyed. Those who have left the Lord will die.
Isaiah,1,29,“You will be ashamed because you have worshiped false gods under the oak trees. You will be disgraced because you have worshiped idols in your gardens.
Isaiah,1,30,You will be like an oak whose leaves are dying. You will be like a garden without water.
Isaiah,1,31,"Powerful people will be like small, dry pieces of wood. And what they do will be like sparks. The people and what they do will burn together. And no one will be able to stop that fire.”"
Isaiah,2,1,Isaiah son of Amoz saw this message about Judah and Jerusalem.
Isaiah,2,2,In the last days the mountain on which the Lord’s Temple stands will become the most important of all mountains. It will be raised above the hills. And people from all nations will come streaming to it.
Isaiah,2,3,"Many nations will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord. Let us go to the Temple of the God of Jacob. Then God will teach us his ways. And we will obey his teachings.” The Lord’s teachings will go out from Jerusalem. The Lord’s message will go out from Jerusalem."
Isaiah,2,4,Then the Lord will settle arguments among many nations. He will make decisions for strong nations that are far away. Then the nations will make their swords into plows. They will make their spears into hooks for trimming trees. Nations will no longer fight other nations. They will not even train for war anymore.
Isaiah,2,5,"Come, family of Jacob. We should follow the way of the Lord."
Isaiah,2,6,"Lord, you have left your people, the family of Jacob. They have become filled with wrong ideas from people in the East. Your people try to tell the future like the Philistines. They have completely accepted those foreign ideas."
Isaiah,2,7,Their land has been filled with silver and gold. There are a great many treasures there. Their land has been filled with horses. There are many chariots there.
Isaiah,2,8,Their land is full of idols. The people worship these idols that they made with their own hands. They worship statues shaped by their fingers.
Isaiah,2,9,"People will not be proud any longer. They will bow low with shame. God, do not forgive them."
Isaiah,2,10,Go into the caves of the cliffs. Dig holes and hide in the ground. Hide from the anger of the Lord and from his great power!
Isaiah,2,11,Proud people will stop being proud. They will bow low with shame. At that time only the Lord will still be praised.
Isaiah,2,12,The Lord of heaven’s armies has a certain day planned. On that day he will punish the proud and those who brag. They will no longer be important.
Isaiah,2,13,He will bring down the tall cedar trees from Lebanon. He will destroy the great oak trees of Bashan.
Isaiah,2,14,He will destroy all the tall mountains and the high hills.
Isaiah,2,15,"He will knock down every tall tower and every high, strong wall."
Isaiah,2,16,He will sink all the trading ships. And he will destroy the beautiful ships.
Isaiah,2,17,At that time proud people will stop being proud. They will bow low with shame. And at that time only the Lord will be praised.
Isaiah,2,18,But all the idols will be gone.
Isaiah,2,19,People will run to caves in the rocky cliffs. They will dig holes and hide in the ground. They will hide from the anger of the Lord and his great power. They will do this when the Lord stands to shake the earth.
Isaiah,2,20,At that time people will throw away their gold and silver idols. They made these idols for themselves to worship. But they will throw them away to the bats and moles.
Isaiah,2,21,Then the people will hide in caves and cracks in the rocks. They will hide from the anger of the Lord and his great power. They will do this when the Lord stands to shake the earth.
Isaiah,2,22,You should stop trusting in people to save you. People are only human. They aren’t able to help you.
Isaiah,3,1,"Understand what I am telling you. The Master, the Lord of heaven’s armies, will take away everything Judah and Jerusalem need. He will take away all the food and water."
Isaiah,3,2,"He will take away all the heroes and great soldiers. He will take away all the judges, prophets, people who do magic and elders."
Isaiah,3,3,"He will take away the military leaders and government leaders. He will take away the counselors, the skilled craftsmen and those who try to tell the future."
Isaiah,3,4,"The Lord says, “I will cause young boys to be your leaders. Foolish children will rule over you."
Isaiah,3,5,Everyone will be against everyone else. Young people will not respect older people. Common people will not respect important people.”
Isaiah,3,6,"At that time a man will grab one of his brothers from his own family and say, “You have a coat. So you will be our leader. You will be the leader over all these ruins.”"
Isaiah,3,7,"But that brother will stand up and say, “I cannot help you. I do not have food or clothes in my house. You will not make me your leader.”"
Isaiah,3,8,This will happen because Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen. The things they say and do are against the Lord. They sin openly against the Lord.
Isaiah,3,9,"The look on their faces shows they are guilty of doing wrong. Like the people of Sodom, they are proud of their sin. They don’t care who sees it. How terrible it will be for them! They have brought much trouble to themselves."
Isaiah,3,10,Tell the good people that good things will happen to them. They will receive a reward for the good they do.
Isaiah,3,11,But how terrible it will be for wicked people! They will be punished for all the wrong they have done.
Isaiah,3,12,"Children treat my people cruelly. Women rule over them. My people, your guides lead you in the wrong way. They turn you away from what is right."
Isaiah,3,13,The Lord takes his place in court. He stands to judge the people.
Isaiah,3,14,"The Lord presents his case against the elders and other leaders of his people. He says, “You have burned my vineyard. Your houses are full of what you took from the poor."
Isaiah,3,15,"What gives you the right to crush my people? How can you grind the faces of the poor into the dirt?” The Master, the Lord of heaven’s armies, said this."
Isaiah,3,16,"The Lord says, “The women of Jerusalem are proud. They walk around with their heads held high. They flirt with their eyes. They take quick, short steps, making noise with their ankle bracelets.”"
Isaiah,3,17,So the Lord will put sores on the heads of those women in Jerusalem. He will make them lose all their hair.
Isaiah,3,18,"At that time the Lord will take away everything that makes them proud. He will take away their beautiful ankle bracelets, their headbands and their necklaces shaped like the moon."
Isaiah,3,19,"He will take away their earrings, bracelets and veils."
Isaiah,3,20,"He will take away their scarves, ankle chains, the cloth belts worn around their waists, their bottles of perfume and charms."
Isaiah,3,21,"He will take away their signet rings, nose rings,"
Isaiah,3,22,"their fine robes, capes, shawls and purses."
Isaiah,3,23,"And he will take away their mirrors, linen dresses, turbans and long shawls."
Isaiah,3,24,"Instead of having sweet-smelling perfume, they will stink. Instead of fine cloth belts, they will have ropes of captives to wear. Instead of having their hair fixed in fancy ways, they will be bald. Instead of fine clothes, they will have rough clothes of sadness. Instead of having beauty, they will have the brand of a captive."
Isaiah,3,25,At that time your men will be killed with swords. Your heroes will die in war.
Isaiah,3,26,There will be crying and sadness in the meeting places near the city gates. Jerusalem will be like a woman who has lost everything and sits on the ground.
Isaiah,4,1,"At that time seven women will grab one man. They will say, “We will make our own bread. And we will make our own clothes. But please marry us! Please, take away our shame.”"
Isaiah,4,2,At that time the Lord’s branch will be very beautiful and great. The people still living in Israel will be proud of what the land grows.
Isaiah,4,3,All the people who are still living in Jerusalem will be called holy. This will be all the people whose names are recorded among the living in Jerusalem.
Isaiah,4,4,The Lord will wash away the filth from the women of Jerusalem. He will wash the bloodstains out of Jerusalem. He will clean Jerusalem with the spirit of fairness and the spirit of fire.
Isaiah,4,5,"As he did when Israel left Egypt, the Lord will cover them with a cloud of smoke during the day. And he will cover them with a bright, flaming fire at night. These proofs will be over Mount Zion. They will be over every meeting of the people there. There will be a covering over every person."
Isaiah,4,6,This covering will be a place of safety. It will protect the people from the heat of the sun. It will be a safe place to hide from the storm and rain.
Isaiah,5,1,Now I will sing a song to my friend. This song is about his vineyard. My friend had a vineyard on a hill with very rich soil.
Isaiah,5,2,He dug and cleared the field of stones. He planted the best grapevines there. And he built a tower in the middle of it. He cut out a winepress as well. He hoped good grapes would grow there. But only bad grapes grew.
Isaiah,5,3,"My friend says, “You people living in Jerusalem, and you men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard."
Isaiah,5,4,What more could I have done for my vineyard? I did everything I could. I hoped for good grapes to grow. But why were there only bad grapes?
Isaiah,5,5,"Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will remove the hedge, and it will be burned. I will break down the stone wall, and it will be walked on."
Isaiah,5,6,I will ruin my field. It will not be trimmed or hoed. Weeds and thorns will grow there. I will command the clouds not to rain on it.”
Isaiah,5,7,"The vineyard belonging to the Lord of heaven’s armies is the nation of Israel. The garden that the Lord loves is the men of Judah. The Lord looked for justice, but there was only killing. The Lord hoped for right living, but there were only cries of pain."
Isaiah,5,8,How terrible it will be for you who add more houses to your houses and more fields to your fields. Finally there is no room left for other people. Then you are left alone in the land.
Isaiah,5,9,The Lord of heaven’s armies said this to me: “The fine houses will be destroyed. The large and beautiful houses will be left empty.
Isaiah,5,10,At that time a ten-acre vineyard will make only six gallons of wine. And ten bushels of seed will grow only half a bushel of grain.”
Isaiah,5,11,"How terrible it will be for people who rise early in the morning to look for strong drink. They stay awake late at night, becoming drunk with wine."
Isaiah,5,12,"At their parties they have lyres, harps, tambourines, flutes and wine. They don’t see what the Lord has done. They don’t notice the work of his hands."
Isaiah,5,13,So my people will be captured and taken away because they don’t really know me. All the great men will die of hunger. The common people will die of thirst.
Isaiah,5,14,So the place where the dead are wants more and more people. It opens its mouth wide. Jerusalem’s important men will go down into it. And the common people will go down into it.
Isaiah,5,15,So the common people and the great people will be humbled. Those who are proud will be humbled.
Isaiah,5,16,The Lord of heaven’s armies will receive glory by judging fairly. The holy God will show himself holy by doing what is right.
Isaiah,5,17,Then the sheep will go anywhere they want. Lambs will feed on the land that rich people once owned.
Isaiah,5,18,How terrible it will be for those people! They pull their guilt and sins behind them as people pull wagons with ropes.
Isaiah,5,19,"They say, “Let’s see God hurry. Let’s see him do his work soon. We want to see it. Let’s see the plan of the Holy One of Israel happen soon. Then we would know what it really is.”"
Isaiah,5,20,How terrible it will be for people who call good things bad and bad things good. They think darkness is light and light is darkness. They think sour is sweet and sweet is sour.
Isaiah,5,21,How terrible it will be for people who think they are wise. They think they are clever.
Isaiah,5,22,How terrible it will be for people who are famous for drinking wine. They are champions at mixing drinks.
Isaiah,5,23,They take money to set the guilty free. But they don’t allow good people to be judged fairly.
Isaiah,5,24,They will be destroyed just as fire burns straw or dry grass. They will be destroyed like a plant whose roots rot and whose flower dies and blows away like dust. They have refused to obey the teachings of the Lord of heaven’s armies. They hated the message from the Holy God of Israel.
Isaiah,5,25,So the Lord has become very angry with his people. And he has raised his hand to punish them. Even the mountains are frightened. Dead bodies lie in the streets like garbage. But the Lord is still angry. His hand is still raised to strike down the people.
Isaiah,5,26,God raises a banner for the nations far away. He is whistling to call those people. The enemy comes quickly!
Isaiah,5,27,Not one of them becomes tired or falls down. Not one of them gets sleepy and falls asleep. Their weapons are close at hand. Their sandal straps are not broken.
Isaiah,5,28,Their arrows are sharp. All of their bows are ready to shoot. The horses’ hooves are hard as rock. Their chariot wheels move like a whirlwind.
Isaiah,5,29,Their shout is like the roar of a lion. It is loud like a young lion. The enemy growls as they grab their captives. There is no one to stop them from taking their captives away.
Isaiah,5,30,"On that day they will roar like the waves of the sea. And when people look at the land, they will see only darkness and pain. All light will become dark in this thick cloud."
Isaiah,6,1,"In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord. He was sitting on a very high throne. His long robe filled the Temple."
Isaiah,6,2,Burning heavenly creatures stood above him. Each creature had six wings. They used two wings to cover their faces. They used two wings to cover their feet. And they used two wings for flying.
Isaiah,6,3,"Each creature was calling to the others: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of heaven’s armies. His glory fills the whole earth.”"
Isaiah,6,4,Their voices caused the frame around the door to shake. The Temple filled with smoke.
Isaiah,6,5,"I said, “Oh, no! I will be destroyed. I am not pure. And I live among people who are not pure. But I have seen the King, the Lord of heaven’s armies.”"
Isaiah,6,6,On the altar there was a fire. One of the burning heavenly creatures used a pair of tongs to take a hot coal from the fire. Then he flew to me with the hot coal in his hand.
Isaiah,6,7,"The creature touched my mouth with the hot coal. Then he said, “Look. Your guilt is taken away because this hot coal has touched your lips. Your sin is taken away.”"
Isaiah,6,8,"Then I heard the Lord’s voice. He said, “Whom can I send? Who will go for us?” So I said, “Here I am. Send me!”"
Isaiah,6,9,"Then the Lord said, “Go and tell this to the people: ‘You will listen and listen, but you will not understand. You will look and look, but you will not learn.’"
Isaiah,6,10,"Make these people stubborn. Make them not able to understand what they hear and see. Otherwise, they might really understand what they see with their eyes and hear with their ears. They might really understand in their minds. If they did this, they would come back to me and be forgiven.”"
Isaiah,6,11,"Then I asked, “Lord, how long should I do this?” He answered, “Do this until the cities are destroyed and the people are gone. Do this until there are no people left living in the houses. Do this until the land is destroyed and left empty."
Isaiah,6,12,I will send the people far away. And the land will be left empty.
Isaiah,6,13,"One-tenth of the people will be left in the land. But the land will be destroyed again. These people will be like an oak tree. When the tree is chopped down, a stump is left. The people who remain will be like a stump that will sprout again.”"
Isaiah,7,1,"Now Ahaz was the son of Jotham, who was the son of Uzziah. When Ahaz was king of Judah, Rezin and Pekah went up to Jerusalem to fight against it. Rezin was king of Aram. And Pekah son of Remaliah was king of Israel. But they were not able to defeat the city."
Isaiah,7,2,"A message was told to Ahaz king of Judah. It said, “The armies of Aram and Israel have joined together.” When Ahaz heard this, he and the people became very frightened. They shook with fear like trees of the forest blown by the wind."
Isaiah,7,3,"Then the Lord told Isaiah, “You and your son Shear-Jashub should go out and talk to Ahaz. Go to the place where the water flows into the upper pool. This is on the road to the Washerman’s Field."
Isaiah,7,4,"Tell Ahaz, ‘Be careful. Be calm, and don’t be afraid. Don’t let those two men, Rezin and Remaliah’s son Pekah, scare you. Don’t be afraid of their anger and Aram’s anger. Those two men are as weak as two barely burning sticks that are ready to go out."
Isaiah,7,5,"They have made plans against you. They said,"
Isaiah,7,6,“Let’s fight against Judah and tear it apart. We will divide Judah for ourselves. We will make the son of Tabeel the new king of Judah.”
Isaiah,7,7,"But I, the Lord God, say, Their plan will not succeed. It will not happen."
Isaiah,7,8,"That is because Aram is led by the city of Damascus. And Damascus is led by its weak king, Rezin. Within 65 years Israel will no longer be a nation."
Isaiah,7,9,"Israel is led by the city of Samaria, and Samaria is led by its weak king, the son of Remaliah. If your faith is not strong, then you will not have strength to last.’”"
Isaiah,7,10,Then the Lord spoke to Ahaz again.
Isaiah,7,11,"The Lord said, “Ask for a sign to prove to yourself that these things are true. It may be a sign from as deep as the place where the dead are or as high as the heavens.”"
Isaiah,7,12,"But Ahaz said, “I will not ask for a sign. I will not test the Lord.”"
Isaiah,7,13,"Then Isaiah said, “Ahaz, descendant of David, listen very carefully! Isn’t it bad enough that you wear out the patience of people? Do you have to wear out the patience of my God also?"
Isaiah,7,14,"But the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be pregnant. She will have a son, and she will name him Immanuel."
Isaiah,7,15,He will be eating milk curds and honey when he learns to reject what is evil and to choose what is good.
Isaiah,7,16,"You are afraid of the kings of Israel and Aram now. But before the child learns what is good and what is evil, the lands of Israel and Aram will be empty."
Isaiah,7,17,The Lord will bring some troubled times to you. Those troubles will come to your people and to the people of your father’s family. The Lord will bring the king of Assyria to fight against you.
Isaiah,7,18,“At that time the Lord will whistle to call for the Egyptians. And they will come like flies from the streams of Egypt. The Lord will call for the Assyrians. And they will come like bees from the land of Assyria.
Isaiah,7,19,These enemies will camp in the deep ravines and in the cliffs. They will camp by the thornbushes and watering holes.
Isaiah,7,20,The Lord will use Assyria to punish Judah. Assyria will be hired and used like a razor. It will be as if the Lord is shaving the hair from Judah’s head and legs and is shaving off Judah’s beard.
Isaiah,7,21,“At that time a person will be able to keep only one young cow and two sheep alive.
Isaiah,7,22,There will be only enough milk for that person to eat milk curds. All who remain in the land will go back to eating only milk curds and honey.
Isaiah,7,23,"In this land there are now vineyards that have 1,000 grapevines. These grapevines are worth about 25 pounds of silver. But these fields will become full of weeds and thorns."
Isaiah,7,24,The land will become wild and useful only as a hunting ground.
Isaiah,7,25,People once worked and grew food on these hills. But at that time people will not go there. The land will be filled with weeds and thorns. Only sheep and cattle will go to those places.”
Isaiah,8,1,"The Lord told me, “Take a large scroll on which to write. Use a pen to write these words: ‘Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.’"
Isaiah,8,2,I will gather some men to be reliable witnesses. They will be Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah.”
Isaiah,8,3,"Then I went to the prophetess. She became pregnant and had a son. Then the Lord told me, “Name the boy Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz."
Isaiah,8,4,The king of Assyria will take away all the wealth and possessions of Damascus and Samaria. This will happen before the boy learns to say ‘my father’ or ‘my mother.’”
Isaiah,8,5,Again the Lord spoke to me.
Isaiah,8,6,"He said, “These people refuse to accept the slow-moving waters of the pool of Shiloah. These people are terrified of Rezin and Remaliah’s son Pekah."
Isaiah,8,7,"So I, the Lord, will bring the king of Assyria and all his power against them. They will come like a powerful flood of water from the Euphrates River. The Assyrians will be like water rising over the banks of the river, flowing over the land."
Isaiah,8,8,"That water will flow into Judah and pass through it. It will rise to Judah’s throat. Immanuel, this army will spread its wings like a bird until it covers your whole country.”"
Isaiah,8,9,"Be broken, all you nations. Be smashed to pieces. Listen, all you faraway countries. Prepare for battle and be smashed to pieces! Prepare for battle and be smashed to pieces!"
Isaiah,8,10,Make your plans for the fight. But your plans will be defeated. Give orders to your armies. But your orders will be useless. This is because God is with us.
Isaiah,8,11,"The Lord spoke to me with his great power. He warned me not to follow the lead of the rest of the people. The Lord said,"
Isaiah,8,12,“People are saying that others make plans against them. You should not believe those things. Don’t be afraid of the things they fear. Do not dread those things.
Isaiah,8,13,But remember that the Lord of heaven’s armies is holy. He is the one you should fear. He is the one you should dread.
Isaiah,8,14,"Then he would be a place of safety for you. But for the two families of Israel, he will be like a stone that causes people to stumble. He will be like a rock that makes them fall. He will be like a trap for the people of Jerusalem. He will catch them in his trap."
Isaiah,8,15,Many people will fall over this rock. They will fall and be broken. They will be trapped and caught.”
Isaiah,8,16,Make an agreement. Seal up the teaching while my followers are watching.
Isaiah,8,17,I will wait for the Lord to help us. The Lord is ashamed of the family of Israel. I will trust the Lord.
Isaiah,8,18,I am here. And with me are the children the Lord has given me. We are signs and proofs for the people of Israel. We have been sent by the Lord of heaven’s armies. He lives on Mount Zion.
Isaiah,8,19,"Some people say, “Ask the mediums and fortune-tellers what to do. They whisper and mutter and ask dead people what to do.” But I tell you that people should ask their God for help. Why should people who are still alive ask something from the dead?"
Isaiah,8,20,You should follow the teachings and the agreement with the Lord. The mediums and fortune-tellers do not speak the word of the Lord. Their words are worth nothing.
Isaiah,8,21,"People will wander through the land troubled and hungry. When they become hungry, they will become angry. Then they will look up and curse their king and their God."
Isaiah,8,22,They will look around them at their land. And they will see only trouble and darkness and awful gloom. And they will be forced into the darkness.
Isaiah,9,1,But suddenly there will be no more gloom for the land that suffered. In the past God made the lands of Zebulun and Naphtali hang their heads in shame. But in the future that land will be made great. That land stretches from the way along the Mediterranean Sea to the land along the Jordan River. And it goes north to Galilee where the people who are not Israelites live.
Isaiah,9,2,Now those people live in darkness. But they will see a great light. They live in a place that is very dark. But a light will shine on them.
Isaiah,9,3,"God, you will cause the nation to grow. You will make the people happy. And they will show their happiness to you. It will be like the joy during harvest time. It will be like the joy of people taking what they have won in war."
Isaiah,9,4,"Like the time you defeated Midian, you will take away their heavy load. You will take away the heavy pole from their backs. You will take away the rod the enemy uses to punish your people."
Isaiah,9,5,Every boot that marched in battle will be destroyed. Every uniform stained with blood will be destroyed. They will be thrown into the fire.
Isaiah,9,6,"A child will be born to us. God will give a son to us. He will be responsible for leading the people. His name will be Wonderful Counselor, Powerful God, Father Who Lives Forever, Prince of Peace."
Isaiah,9,7,"Power and peace will be in his kingdom. It will continue to grow. He will rule as king on David’s throne and over David’s kingdom. He will make it strong, by ruling with goodness and fair judgment. He will rule it forever and ever. The Lord of heaven’s armies will do this because of his strong love for his people."
Isaiah,9,8,The Lord sent a message against the people of Jacob. That message says that God will judge Israel.
Isaiah,9,9,"Then everyone in Israel, even the leaders in Samaria, will know that God punished them. Those people, who are proud and who brag now, say this:"
Isaiah,9,10,"“These bricks have fallen, but we will build again with cut stones. These small trees have been chopped down. But we will put great cedars there.”"
Isaiah,9,11,But the Lord will make the enemies of Rezin strong against them. He will stir up their enemies against them.
Isaiah,9,12,The Arameans come from the east and the Philistines from the west. They will eat up Israel with their armies. But the Lord is still angry. His hand is still raised to punish the people.
Isaiah,9,13,But the people do not return to the one who struck them. They do not follow the Lord of heaven’s armies.
Isaiah,9,14,So the Lord will cut off Israel’s head and tail. He will take away both the branch and stalk in one day.
Isaiah,9,15,The elders and important men are the head. The prophets who speak lies are the tail.
Isaiah,9,16,Those who lead the people lead them in the wrong direction. And those who follow them will be destroyed.
Isaiah,9,17,So the Lord is not happy with the young men. He will not show mercy to the widows and orphans. All the people are separated from God and are very evil. They all speak lies. But the Lord is still angry. His hand is still raised to strike down the people.
Isaiah,9,18,"Evil is like a small fire. First, it burns weeds and thorns. Next, it burns the larger bushes in the forest. They all go up in a column of smoke."
Isaiah,9,19,The Lord of heaven’s armies is angry. So the land will be burned. All the people will be burned in that fire. No one will try to save his brother.
Isaiah,9,20,"People will grab something on the right, but they will still be hungry. They will eat something on the left, but they will not be filled. Then each person will turn and eat his own children."

Isaiah,10,1,How terrible it will be for the lawmakers who write evil laws. They write laws that make life hard for people.
Isaiah,10,2,They are not fair to the poor. They rob my people of their rights. They allow people to steal from widows and to take from orphans what they should get.
Isaiah,10,3,"Lawmakers, how will you explain the things you have done? What will you do when your destruction comes from far away? Where will you run for help? Where will you hide your money and your riches then?"
Isaiah,10,4,You will have to bow down among the captives. You will fall down among the dead bodies. But the Lord is still angry. His hand is still raised to strike down the people.
Isaiah,10,5,"God says, “How terrible it will be for the king of Assyria. I use him like a stick. In anger I use Assyria like a club."
Isaiah,10,6,I send it to fight against a nation that is separated from God. I am angry with those people. So I command Assyria to fight against them. Assyria will take their wealth from them. Judah will become like dirt for them to walk on in the streets.
Isaiah,10,7,But Assyria’s king doesn’t understand that I am using him. He doesn’t know he is a tool for me. He only wants to destroy other people. He plans to destroy many nations.
Isaiah,10,8,"The king of Assyria says to himself, ‘All of my commanders are like kings."
Isaiah,10,9,The city Calno is like the city Carchemish. And the city Hamath is like the city Arpad. The city Samaria is like the city Damascus.
Isaiah,10,10,I defeated those kingdoms that worship idols. And those idols were more than the idols of Jerusalem and Samaria.
Isaiah,10,11,I defeated Samaria and her idols. So I will also defeat Jerusalem and her idols.’”
Isaiah,10,12,The Lord will finish doing what he planned to Mount Zion and Jerusalem. Then he will punish Assyria. The king of Assyria is very proud. His pride made him do these bad things. So God will punish him.

Isaiah,10,14,"I have taken the riches of all these people, like one who reaches into a bird’s nest. I have taken these nations, like a person taking eggs. No one raised a hand against me. No one opened his mouth to stop me.”"
Isaiah,10,15,An ax is not better than the person who swings it. A saw is not better than the person who uses it. A stick cannot control the person who picks it up. A club cannot pick up the person!
Isaiah,10,16,"So the Master, the Lord of heaven’s armies, will send a terrible disease against Assyria’s soldiers. The strength of Assyria will be burned up. It will be like a fire burning until everything is gone."
Isaiah,10,17,"God, the Light of Israel, will be like a fire. The Holy One will be like a flame. He will be like a fire that suddenly burns the weeds and thorns."

Isaiah,10,22,"Israel, your people are very many. They are like the grains of sand by the sea. But only a few of them will be left alive to return to the Lord. God has announced that he will destroy the land completely and fairly."
Isaiah,10,23,"The Master, the Lord of heaven’s armies, will certainly destroy this land. He will destroy it as he has announced."
Isaiah,10,24,"This is what the Master, the Lord of heaven’s armies, says: “My people living in Jerusalem, don’t be afraid of the Assyrians. They beat you with a rod. They raise a stick to hurt you, as Egypt did."
Isaiah,10,25,But after a short time my anger will stop. Then I will turn my anger to destroying them.”
Isaiah,10,26,Then the Lord of heaven’s armies will beat the Assyrians with a whip. He will defeat them as he defeated Midian at the rock of Oreb. He will raise his stick over the waters as he did in Egypt.
Isaiah,10,27,Then the troubles that Assyria puts on you will be removed. The load they make you carry will be taken away.
Isaiah,10,28,The army of Assyria will enter near Aiath. They will walk through Migron. They will store their food in Micmash.
Isaiah,10,29,The army will go over the pass. They will sleep at Geba. The people of Ramah will be afraid. The people at Gibeah of Saul will run away.

Isaiah,10,34,The Lord will cut them down as a forest is cut down with an ax. And the great trees of Lebanon will fall by the power of the Mighty One.
Isaiah,11,1,A branch will grow from a stump of a tree that was cut down. So a new king will come from the family of Jesse.
Isaiah,11,2,"The Spirit of the Lord will rest upon that king. The Spirit gives him wisdom, understanding, guidance and power. And the Spirit teaches him to know and respect the Lord."
Isaiah,11,3,This king will be glad to obey the Lord. He will not judge by the way things look. He will not judge by what people say.
Isaiah,11,4,He will judge the poor honestly. He will be fair in his decisions for the poor people of the land. At his command evil people will be punished. By his words the wicked will be put to death.
Isaiah,11,5,Goodness and fairness will give him strength. They will be like a belt around his waist.
Isaiah,11,6,"Then wolves will live in peace with lambs. And leopards will lie down to rest with goats. Calves, lions and young bulls will eat together. And a little child will lead them."
Isaiah,11,7,Cows and bears will eat together in peace. Their young will lie down together. Lions will eat hay as oxen do.
Isaiah,11,8,A baby will be able to play near a cobra’s hole. A child will be able to put his hand into the nest of a poisonous snake.
Isaiah,11,9,"They will not hurt or destroy each other on all my holy mountain. The earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the sea is full of water."

Isaiah,11,11,"At that time the Lord will again reach out and take his people who are left alive. These are God’s people who are left alive in Assyria, North Egypt, South Egypt, Cush, Elam, Babylonia, Hamath and all the islands of the sea."
Isaiah,11,12,God will raise a banner as a sign for all people. He will gather the people of Israel who were forced from their country. He will gather the scattered people of Judah from all parts of the earth.
Isaiah,11,13,At that time Israel will not be jealous anymore. Judah will have no enemies left. Israel will not be jealous of Judah. And Judah will not hate Israel.
Isaiah,11,14,But Israel and Judah will attack the Philistines on the west. Together they will take the riches from the people of the east. They will conquer Edom and Moab. And the people of Ammon will be under their control.
Isaiah,11,15,The Lord will dry up the Red Sea of Egypt. He will wave his arm over the Euphrates River. He will dry it up with a scorching wind. He will divide it into seven small rivers. And people will be able to walk across them with their sandals on.
Isaiah,11,16,So God’s people who are left alive will have a way to leave Assyria. It will be like the time the Israelites went out of Egypt.
Isaiah,12,1,"At that time you will say: “I praise you, Lord! You were angry with me. But you are not angry with me now! You have comforted me."
Isaiah,12,2,"God is the one who saves me. I trust him. I am not afraid. The Lord, the Lord, gives me strength and makes me sing. He has saved me.”"

Isaiah,12,6,"Shout and sing for joy, you people of Jerusalem. The Holy One of Israel does great things before your eyes.”"
Isaiah,13,1,God showed Isaiah son of Amoz this message about Babylon:
Isaiah,13,2,Raise a flag on the bare mountain. Call out to the men. Raise your hand to signal them. Tell them to enter through the gates for important people.
Isaiah,13,3,I myself have commanded those people whom I have separated as mine. I have called those warriors to carry out my anger. They rejoice and are glad to do my will.
Isaiah,13,4,Listen to the loud noise in the mountains. It sounds like many people. Listen to the noise among the kingdoms. Nations are gathering together. The Lord of heaven’s armies is calling his army together for battle.
Isaiah,13,5,This army is coming from a faraway land. It is coming from the edge of the horizon. In anger the Lord is using this army like a weapon. And it will destroy the whole country.
Isaiah,13,6,"Cry, because the Lord’s day of judging is near. God All-Powerful is sending destruction."
Isaiah,13,7,People will be weak with fear. Their courage will melt away.
Isaiah,13,8,Everyone will be afraid. Pain and hurt will grab them. They will hurt like a woman giving birth to a baby. They will look at each other in fear. Their faces will become red like fire.
Isaiah,13,9,"Look, the Lord’s day of judging is coming. It will be a terrible day. God will be very angry, and he will destroy the country. God will destroy the sinners who live in the land."
Isaiah,13,10,The stars will not show their light. The skies will be dark. The sun will grow dark as it rises. And the moon will not give its light.
Isaiah,13,11,"The Lord says, “I will punish the world for its evil. I will punish wicked people for their sins. I will cause the proud people to lose their pride. I will destroy the pride of those who are cruel to others."
Isaiah,13,12,People will be harder to find than pure gold. There will be fewer people than there is fine gold in Ophir.
Isaiah,13,13,I will make the sky shake. And the earth will be moved from its place. The Lord of heaven’s armies will be very angry. His anger will burn at that time.
Isaiah,13,14,“Then the people from Babylon will run away like hunted deer. They will run like sheep who have no shepherd. Everyone will turn back to his own people. Each will run back to his own land.
Isaiah,13,15,Anyone who is captured will be killed. Everyone who is caught will be killed with a sword.
Isaiah,13,16,Their little children will be beaten to death as their parents watch. Everything in their houses will be stolen. And their wives will be raped.
Isaiah,13,17,"Look, I will cause the armies of Media to attack Babylon. They do not care about silver. They do not delight in gold."
Isaiah,13,18,Their soldiers will shoot the young men with arrows. The soldiers will show no mercy on the children. They will not feel sorry for the little boys.
Isaiah,13,19,Babylon is the most beautiful of all kingdoms. The Babylonians are very proud of it. But God will destroy it like Sodom and Gomorrah.
Isaiah,13,20,No one will ever live there. No one will settle there again. No Arab will put his tent there. No shepherd will bring his sheep there.
Isaiah,13,21,Only animals from the desert will live there. The houses of Babylon will be full of wild dogs. Owls will live there. Wild goats will leap about in the houses.
Isaiah,13,22,Wolves will howl within the strong walls. Wild dogs will bark in the beautiful buildings. The end of Babylon is near. Its time is almost over.”
Isaiah,14,1,The Lord will again show mercy to the people of Jacob. The Lord will again choose the people of Israel. He will settle them in their own land. Then non-Israelite people will join the Israelites. The non-Israelite people will become a part of the family of Jacob.
Isaiah,14,2,Nations will take the Israelites back to their land. Those men and women from the other nations will become slaves to Israel. In the past the Israelites were their slaves. But now the Israelites will defeat those nations and rule over them.
Isaiah,14,3,"The Lord will take away the Israelites’ hard work, and he will comfort them. They will no longer have to work as slaves."
Isaiah,14,4,On that day Israel will sing this song about the king of Babylon: The cruel king who ruled us is finished. His rule is finished!
Isaiah,14,5,The Lord breaks the scepter of evil rulers. He takes away their power.
Isaiah,14,6,The king of Babylon beat people in anger. He beat them again and again. He ruled the people in anger. He kept on doing terrible things to the people.
Isaiah,14,7,"But now, the whole land rests and is quiet. Now the people begin to sing."
Isaiah,14,8,"Even the pine trees are happy. And the cedar trees of Lebanon rejoice. They say, “The king has fallen. No one will ever cut us down again.”"
Isaiah,14,9,The place of the dead is excited to meet you when you come. It wakes the spirits of the dead to greet you. They were the leaders of the world. It makes dead kings stand up from their thrones to greet you. They were rulers of nations.
Isaiah,14,10,"All these leaders will make fun of you. They will say, “Now you are weak, as we are. Now you are just like us.”"
Isaiah,14,11,Your pride has been sent down to where the dead are. The music from your harps goes with it. Flies are spread out like your bed beneath you. And worms cover your body like a blanket.
Isaiah,14,12,"King of Babylon, morning star, you have fallen from heaven, even though you were as bright as the rising sun! In the past all the nations on earth bowed down before you. But now you have been cut down."
Isaiah,14,13,"You told yourself, “I will go up to heaven. I will put my throne above God’s stars. I will sit on the mountain of the gods. I will sit on the slopes of the sacred mountain."
Isaiah,14,14,I will go up above the tops of the clouds. I will be like God Most High.”
Isaiah,14,15,But you were brought down to the grave. You were brought down to the deep places where the dead are.
Isaiah,14,16,"Those who see you stare at you. They think about what has happened to you. They say, “Is this the same man who caused great fear on earth? Is he the one who shook the kingdoms?"
Isaiah,14,17,Is this the man who turned the land into a desert? Is he the one who destroyed its cities? Is he the one who captured people in war and would not let them go home?”
Isaiah,14,18,Every king of the earth has been buried with honor. Every king has his own grave.
Isaiah,14,19,"But you are thrown out of your grave, like an unwanted branch is cut from a tree and thrown away. You are covered by bodies that died in battle. You have been thrown into a rocky pit. And other soldiers walk on you."
Isaiah,14,20,You will not be buried like other people. This is because you ruined your own country. And you killed your own people. So your children will never be mentioned again.
Isaiah,14,21,Prepare to kill his children. Kill them because their father is guilty. They will never again take control of the earth. They will never again fill the world with their cities.
Isaiah,14,22,"The Lord of heaven’s armies says this: “I will fight against those people. I will destroy Babylon and its people. I will destroy its people and their descendants,” says the Lord."

Isaiah,14,26,“This is what I plan to do against all the earth. I will raise my hand to strike down all nations.”
Isaiah,14,27,"When the Lord of heaven’s armies makes a plan, no one can stop it. When the Lord raises his hand to punish people, no one can stop him."
Isaiah,14,28,This message was given the year King Ahaz died:
Isaiah,14,29,"Country of Philistia, don’t be so happy. The king who beat you is now dead. But he is like a snake that will give birth to another dangerous snake. The new king will be like a quick, dangerous snake to bite you."
Isaiah,14,30,Even the poorest of my people will be able to eat safely. People in need will be able to lie down in safety. But I will kill your family with hunger. And all your people who are left will die.
Isaiah,14,31,"People near the city gates, cry out! Philistines, be frightened! A cloud of dust comes from the north. It is an army, full of men ready to fight."
Isaiah,14,32,What shall we tell the messengers from Philistia? Say that the Lord has made Jerusalem strong. Say that his poor people will go there for safety.
Isaiah,15,1,This is a message about Moab: In one night armies took the wealth from Ar in Moab. That night the city was destroyed. In one night armies took the wealth from Kir in Moab. That night the city was destroyed.
Isaiah,15,2,The people of Dibon go to the places of worship to cry. The people of Moab cry for the cities of Nebo and Medeba. Everyone has shaved his head and beard to show how sad he is.
Isaiah,15,3,"In the streets at Moab they wear rough cloth to show their sadness. On the roofs and in the public squares, they are crying loudly."
Isaiah,15,4,People in the cities Heshbon and Elealeh cry out loud. You can hear their voices far away in the city Jahaz. Even the soldiers are frightened. They are shaking from fear.
Isaiah,15,5,My heart cries with sorrow for Moab. Its people run away to Zoar for safety. They run to Eglath Shelishiyah. People are going up the mountain road to Luhith. They are crying as they go. People are going on the road to Horonaim. They cry out loud over their destruction.
Isaiah,15,6,But the water of Nimrim has dried up. The grass has dried up. All the plants are dead. Nothing green is left.
Isaiah,15,7,So the people gather up what they have saved. They carry those things and cross the Ravine of the Poplars.
Isaiah,15,8,Crying is heard everywhere in Moab. Their crying is heard as far away as the city Eglaim. Their crying is heard as far away as Beer Elim.
Isaiah,15,9,"The water of the city Dibon is full of blood. And I, the Lord, will bring even more troubles to Dibon. A few people living in Moab have escaped the enemy. But I will send lions to kill them."
Isaiah,16,1,Send the king of the land the payment he demands. Send a lamb from Sela through the desert to the mountain of Jerusalem.
Isaiah,16,2,The women of Moab try to cross the river Arnon. They are like little birds that have fallen from their nest.
Isaiah,16,3,They say: “Help us. Tell us what to do. Protect us from our enemies as shade protects us from the noon sun. Hide us because we are running for safety! Don’t give us to our enemies.
Isaiah,16,4,Let those of us who were forced out of Moab live in your land. Hide us from our enemies.” The robbing of Moab will stop. The enemy will be defeated. The men who hurt others will disappear from the land.
Isaiah,16,5,Then a new loyal king will come. This faithful king will be from the family of David. He will judge fairly. He wants to do what is right.
Isaiah,16,6,We have heard that the people of Moab are proud and very conceited. They are very proud and angry. But their bragging means nothing.
Isaiah,16,7,So the people of Moab will cry. They will all be sad. They will moan and groan for the raisin cakes they had in Kir Hareseth.
Isaiah,16,8,But the fields of Heshbon and the vines of Sibmah cannot grow grapes. Foreign rulers have destroyed the grapevines. The grapevines once spread as far as the city of Jazer and into the desert. They had spread as far as the sea.
Isaiah,16,9,"I cry with the people of Jazer for the grapevines of Sibmah. I will cry with the people of Heshbon and Elealeh. There will be no shouts of joy, because there will be no harvest or ripe fruit."
Isaiah,16,10,There will be no joy and happiness in the orchards. There will be no songs or shouts of joy in the vineyards. No one makes wine in the winepresses. I have put an end to shouts of joy.

Isaiah,17,3,"The strong, walled cities of Israel will be destroyed. The government in Damascus will end. Those left alive of Aram will be like the glory of Israel,” says the Lord of heaven’s armies."
Isaiah,17,4,“At that time Israel’s wealth will all be gone. Israel will be like a man who has lost much weight from sickness.
Isaiah,17,5,That time will be like the grain harvest in the Valley of Rephaim. The workers cut the wheat. Then they cut the heads of grain from the plants. And they collect the grain.
Isaiah,17,6,"That time will also be like the olive harvest, when a few olives are left. Two or three olives are left in the top branches. Four or five olives are left on full branches,” says the Lord, the God of Israel."
Isaiah,17,7,"At that time people will look to God, their Maker. Their eyes will see the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,17,8,They will not trust the altars they have made. They will not trust what their hands have made. They will not respect the Asherah idols and altars they have made.
Isaiah,17,9,In that day all their strong cities will be empty. They will be like the cities that the Hivites and the Amorites left. They left their cities when the Israelites came to take the land. Everything will be ruined.
Isaiah,17,10,You have forgotten the God who saves you. You have not remembered that God is your place of safety. You plant the finest grapevines. You plant grapevines from faraway places.
Isaiah,17,11,You will plant your grapevines one day and try to make them grow. The next day they will begin to grow. But at harvest time everything will be dead. A sickness will kill all the plants.
Isaiah,17,12,Listen to the many people! They are crying loud like the noise from the sea. Listen to the noise! The crying is like the crashing of great waves.

Isaiah,17,14,"At night the people will be very frightened. Before morning, no one will be left. So our enemies will come to our land, but they will become nothing."
Isaiah,18,1,How terrible it will be for the land beyond the rivers of Cush. It is filled with the sound of wings.
Isaiah,18,2,"That land sends people across the sea. They go on the water in boats made of reeds. Quick messengers, go to the people who are tall and smooth-skinned. They are feared everywhere. They are a powerful nation with strange speech. They defeat the other nations. Their land is divided by rivers."
Isaiah,18,3,"All you people of the world, look! Everyone who lives in the world, look! You will see a banner raised on a mountain. You will hear a trumpet sound."
Isaiah,18,4,"The Lord said to me, “I will quietly watch from where I live. I will be like heat in the sunshine. I will be like the dew in the heat of harvest time.”"
Isaiah,18,5,The time will be after the flowers have bloomed and before the harvest. The new grapes will be budding and growing. Then the enemy will cut the plants with knives. He will cut down the vines and take them away.
Isaiah,18,6,They will be left for the birds of the mountains to eat. They will be left for the wild animals to eat. Birds will feed on them all summer. And that winter wild animals will eat them.
Isaiah,18,7,At that time gifts will be brought to the Lord of heaven’s armies. They will come from the people who are tall and smooth-skinned. They are feared everywhere. They are a powerful nation with strange speech. Their land is divided by rivers. These gifts will be brought to the place of the Lord of heaven’s armies. They will be brought to Mount Zion.

Isaiah,19,3,The Egyptians will be afraid. I will ruin their plans. They will ask their idols and spirits of the dead what they should do. They will ask their mediums and fortune-tellers.”
Isaiah,19,4,"The Master, the Lord of heaven’s armies, says, “I will give Egypt to a hard master. A powerful king will rule over them.”"
Isaiah,19,5,The sea will become dry. The water will disappear from the Nile River.

Isaiah,19,9,All the people who make cloth from flax will be sad. Those who weave linen will lose hope.
Isaiah,19,10,Those who weave cloth will be broken. All those who work for money will be sad.
Isaiah,19,11,The officers of the city of Zoan are fools. The wise men who advise the king of Egypt give wrong advice. How can they say to him they are wise? How can they say they are from the old family of the kings?
Isaiah,19,12,"Egypt, where are your wise men? Let them show you what the Lord of heaven’s armies has planned for Egypt."
Isaiah,19,13,The officers of Zoan have been fooled. The leaders of Memphis have believed false things. So the leaders of Egypt lead her the wrong way.
Isaiah,19,14,The Lord has made the leaders confused. They wander and lead Egypt in the wrong ways. They are like drunk people stumbling in their own vomit.
Isaiah,19,15,There is nothing Egypt can do. No one in Egypt can help.
Isaiah,19,16,In that day the people of Egypt will be like frightened women. They will be afraid of the Lord of heaven’s armies. He will raise his hand to strike them down.
Isaiah,19,17,The land of Judah will bring fear to the people in Egypt. Anyone in Egypt who hears the name Judah will be afraid. This will happen because the Lord of heaven’s armies has planned terrible things for Egypt.
Isaiah,19,18,"At that time five cities in Egypt will speak Hebrew, the language of Canaan. They will promise to be loyal to the Lord of heaven’s armies. One of these cities will be named the City of Destruction."
Isaiah,19,19,At that time there will be an altar for the Lord in the middle of Egypt. At the border of Egypt there will be a monument to the Lord.
Isaiah,19,20,"This will be a sign. It will show that the Lord of heaven’s armies is powerful. When the people cry to the Lord for help, he will send help. He will send someone to save and defend the people. He will rescue them from those who hurt them."
Isaiah,19,21,"So the Lord will show himself to the Egyptians. Then they will say he is the Lord. They will serve God and offer many sacrifices. They will make promises to the Lord, and they will keep them."

Isaiah,19,25,"The Lord of heaven’s armies will bless them. He will say, “Egypt, you are my people. Assyria, I made you. Israel, I own you. You are all blessed!”"
Isaiah,20,1,Sargon was the king of Assyria. He sent a military commander to Ashdod to attack that city. So the commander attacked and captured it.
Isaiah,20,2,"Then the Lord spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz. The Lord said, “Take the rough cloth off your body. Take your sandals off your feet.” So Isaiah obeyed the Lord. He walked around without his clothes of rough cloth or his sandals."
Isaiah,20,3,"Then the Lord said, “Isaiah my servant has walked around without his clothes of rough cloth or his sandals for three years. This is a sign for Egypt and Cush."
Isaiah,20,4,The king of Assyria will defeat Egypt and Cush. Assyria will take prisoners and lead them away from their countries. The old people and young people will be led away naked. They will go without clothes and without sandals. So the Egyptians will be shamed.
Isaiah,20,5,People who looked to Cush for help will be afraid. People who were amazed by Egypt’s glory will be shamed.
Isaiah,20,6,"Those people who live near the sea will say, ‘We trusted those countries to help us. We ran to them so they would save us from the king of Assyria. But look at them. They have been captured. So how will we be able to escape?’”"
Isaiah,21,1,The message about the Desert by the Sea: Disaster is coming from the desert. It is coming like wind blowing in the south. It is coming from a terrible country.
Isaiah,21,2,"I have seen a terrible vision. I see traitors turning against you. I see people taking your wealth. Elam, attack the people! Media, surround the city and attack it! I will bring an end to the pain the city causes."
Isaiah,21,3,"I saw those terrible things, and now I am in pain. My pains are like the pains of giving birth. What I hear makes me very afraid. What I see causes me to shake with fear."
Isaiah,21,4,"I am worried, and I am shaking with fear. My pleasant evening has become a night of fear."
Isaiah,21,5,"They set the table. They spread the rugs. They eat and drink! Leaders, stand up. Prepare the shields for battle!"
Isaiah,21,6,"The Lord said to me, “Go. Have a man be a lookout for the city. Have him report what he sees."
Isaiah,21,7,"If he sees chariots and teams of horses, donkeys or camels, he should pay very close attention.”"
Isaiah,21,8,"Then the lookout called out, “My Master, each day I stand in the watchtower watching. Every night I have been on guard."
Isaiah,21,9,"Look. I see a man coming in a chariot with a team of horses.” The man gives back the answer, “Babylon has fallen. It has fallen! All the statues of her gods lie broken on the ground.”"
Isaiah,21,10,"My people are crushed like grain on the threshing floor. My people, I tell you what I have heard from the Lord. He is the Lord of heaven’s armies, the God of Israel."
Isaiah,21,11,"The message about Dumah: Someone calls to me from Edom. He says, “Watchman, how much of the night is left? Watchman, how much longer will it be night?”"
Isaiah,21,12,"The watchman answered, “Morning is coming, but then night will come again. If you have something to ask, then come back and ask.”"
Isaiah,21,13,The message about Arabia: A group of traders from Dedan spent the night near some trees in Arabia.
Isaiah,21,14,They gave water to thirsty travelers. The people of Tema gave food to those who were escaping.

Isaiah,21,16,This is what the Lord said to me: “In one year all the glory of the country of Kedar will be gone. (This is a year as a hired helper counts time.)

Isaiah,22,1,The message about the Valley of Vision: What is wrong with you people? Why are you on your roofs?
Isaiah,22,2,"This city was a very busy city. It was full of noise and wild parties. But your people have been killed, but not with swords. They did not die in battle."
Isaiah,22,3,All your leaders ran away together. But they all have been captured without using a bow. All you who were captured tried to run away before the enemy came near.
Isaiah,22,4,"So I say, “Don’t look at me. Let me cry loudly. Don’t hurry to comfort me about the destruction of Jerusalem.”"
Isaiah,22,5,"The Master, the Lord of heaven’s armies, has chosen a special day. There will be riots and confusion. People will trample each other in the Valley of Vision. The city walls will be knocked down. The people will cry out to the mountain."
Isaiah,22,6,The soldiers from Elam will take their bags of arrows. Men in chariots and on horses will attack. Kir will prepare their shields.
Isaiah,22,7,Your nicest valleys will be filled with chariots. Horsemen will be ordered to guard the gates of the city.
Isaiah,22,8,The walls protecting Judah will fall. At that time the people of Jerusalem depended on the weapons kept at the Palace of the Forest.
Isaiah,22,9,You saw that the walls of Jerusalem had many cracks that needed repairing. You stored up water in the lower pool.
Isaiah,22,10,You counted the houses of Jerusalem. You tore them down to fix the walls with their stones.
Isaiah,22,11,You made a pool between the two walls. It was to save water from the old pool. But you did not trust the God who made these things. You did not respect the One who planned them long ago.
Isaiah,22,12,"The Master, the Lord of heaven’s armies, told the people to cry and be sad. He told them to shave their heads and wear rough cloth."
Isaiah,22,13,"But look. The people are happy. There are wild parties. They kill the cattle and the sheep. They eat the food and drink the wine. They say, “Let us eat and drink, because tomorrow we will die.”"
Isaiah,22,14,"The Lord of heaven’s armies said to me: “You people will die before this guilt is forgiven.” The Master, the Lord of heaven’s armies, said this."
Isaiah,22,15,"This is what the Master, the Lord of heaven’s armies, says: “Go to this servant Shebna. He is the manager of the palace."
Isaiah,22,16,"Say to him, ‘What are you doing here? Who said you could cut out a tomb for yourself here? Why are you preparing your tomb in a high place? Why are you carving out a tomb from the rock?"
Isaiah,22,17,"Look, mighty man! The Lord will throw you away. He will take firm hold of you."
Isaiah,22,18,He will roll you tightly into a ball and throw you into another country. There you will die. Your fine chariots will remain there. You are a disgrace to your master’s house.
Isaiah,22,19,I will force you out of your important job here. You will be thrown down from your important place.’
Isaiah,22,20,“At that time I will call for my servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah.
Isaiah,22,21,I will take your robe and put it on him. I will give him your belt. I will give him the important job you have. He will be like a father to the people of Jerusalem and the family of Judah.
Isaiah,22,22,"I will put the key to the house of David around his neck. If he opens a door, no one will be able to close it. If he closes a door, no one will be able to open it."
Isaiah,22,23,He will be like an honored chair in his father’s house. I will make him strong like a peg that is hammered into a strong board.
Isaiah,22,24,All the honored and important things of his family will depend on him. All the adults and little children will depend on him. They will be like bowls and jars hanging on him.
Isaiah,22,25,"“At that time,” says the Lord of heaven’s armies, “the peg hammered into the strong board will weaken. It will break and fall. And everything hanging on it will be destroyed.” The Lord says this."
Isaiah,23,1,"The message about Tyre: You ships of Tarshish, cry! The houses and harbor of Tyre are destroyed. This news came to the ships from the land of Cyprus."
Isaiah,23,2,"Be silent, you who live on the island of Tyre. You merchants of Sidon, be silent. Seamen have made you rich."
Isaiah,23,3,They traveled the sea to bring grain from Egypt. The men of Tyre brought grain from the Nile Valley and sold it to other nations.
Isaiah,23,4,"Sidon, be ashamed. Strong city of the sea, be ashamed. The sea says: “I have not felt the pain of giving birth. I have not reared young men or women.”"
Isaiah,23,5,Egypt will hear the news about Tyre. And it will make Egypt hurt with sorrow.
Isaiah,23,6,You ships should return to Tarshish. You people living near the sea should be sad.
Isaiah,23,7,"Look at your once happy city! Look at your old, old city! People from that city have traveled far away to live."
Isaiah,23,8,Who planned Tyre’s destruction? Tyre made others rich. Her merchants were treated like princes. Her traders were greatly respected.
Isaiah,23,9,It was the Lord of heaven’s armies who planned this! He decided to make these proud men unimportant. He decided to disgrace those who were greatly respected.
Isaiah,23,10,"Go through your land, Tarshish, like the Nile goes through Egypt. There is no harbor for you now!"
Isaiah,23,11,The Lord has stretched his hand over the sea. He makes its kingdoms tremble. He commands that Canaan’s places of safety be destroyed.
Isaiah,23,12,"The Lord said, “Sidon, you will not rejoice any longer. You are destroyed. Even if you cross the sea to Cyprus, you will not find a place to rest.”"
Isaiah,23,13,Look at the land of the Babylonians. Babylonia is not a country now. Assyria has made it a place for wild animals. Assyria built towers to attack it. The soldiers took all the treasures from its cities. They turned it into ruins.
Isaiah,23,14,"So be sad, you trading ships. Your place of safety is destroyed."
Isaiah,23,15,"At that time people will forget about Tyre for 70 years. That is the length of a king’s life. After 70 years, Tyre will be like the prostitute in this song:"
Isaiah,23,16,"“Oh woman, you are forgotten. Take your harp and walk through the city. Play your harp well. Sing your song often. Then people will remember you.”"
Isaiah,23,17,After 70 years the Lord will deal with Tyre. Tyre will again have trade. It will be like a prostitute for all the nations of the earth.
Isaiah,23,18,The profits will be saved for the Lord. Tyre will not keep the money she earns. It will give them to the people who serve the Lord. So they will have plenty of food and nice clothes.
Isaiah,24,1,Look! The Lord will destroy the earth and leave it empty. He will ruin the surface of the land and scatter its people.
Isaiah,24,2,"At that time the same thing will happen to everyone: to common people and priests, to slaves and masters, to women slaves and their women masters, to buyers and sellers, to those who borrow and those who lend, and to bankers and those who owe the bank."
Isaiah,24,3,The earth will be completely empty. The wealth will all be taken. This will happen because the Lord commanded it.
Isaiah,24,4,The earth will dry up and die. The world will grow weak and die. The great leaders in this land will become weak.
Isaiah,24,5,The people of the earth have ruined it. They do not follow God’s teachings. They do not obey God’s laws. They break their agreement with God that was to last forever.
Isaiah,24,6,A curse will destroy the earth. The people of the world are guilty. So they will be burned up. Only a few will be left.
Isaiah,24,7,"The new wine will be bad, and the grapevines will die. People who were happy will be sad."
Isaiah,24,8,The happy music of the tambourines will end. The happy sounds of wild parties will stop. The joyful music from the harps will end.
Isaiah,24,9,People will no longer sing while they drink their wine. The beer will taste bitter to those who drink it.
Isaiah,24,10,The ruined city will be empty. People will hide behind closed doors.
Isaiah,24,11,People in the streets will ask for wine. But joy will have turned to sadness. All the happiness will have left.
Isaiah,24,12,The city will be left in ruins. Its gates will be smashed to pieces.
Isaiah,24,13,This is what will happen all over the earth. This will happen to all the nations. The earth will be like an olive tree after the harvest. It will be like the few grapes left on a vine after harvest.
Isaiah,24,14,The people shout for joy. From the west they praise the greatness of the Lord.
Isaiah,24,15,"People in the east, praise the Lord. People in the islands of the sea, praise the name of the Lord, the God of Israel."
Isaiah,24,16,"We hear songs from every part of the earth. These songs praise God, the Righteous One. But I said, “I am dying! I am dying! How terrible it will be for me! Traitors turn against people. With their dishonesty, they turn against people.”"
Isaiah,24,17,"There are terrors, holes and traps for the people of the earth."
Isaiah,24,18,Anyone who tries to escape from the sound of terror will fall into a hole. Anyone who climbs out of the hole will be caught in a trap. The clouds in the sky will pour out rain. The foundations of the earth will shake.
Isaiah,24,19,The earth will be broken up. And the earth will split open. The earth will shake violently.
Isaiah,24,20,The earth will stumble around like a man who is drunk. It will shake like a hut in a storm. Its sin is like a heavy weight on its back. The earth will fall and never rise again.
Isaiah,24,21,At that time the Lord will punish the powers in the sky above and the rulers on earth below.
Isaiah,24,22,They will be gathered together. They will be thrown into a pit as prisoners. They will be shut up in prison. After much time they will be punished.
Isaiah,24,23,The moon will be embarrassed. The sun will be ashamed. This will happen because the Lord of heaven’s armies will rule as king on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. Jerusalem’s leaders will see his greatness.
Isaiah,25,1,"Lord, you are my God. I honor you and praise you. You have done amazing things. You have always done what you said you would. You have done what you planned long ago."
Isaiah,25,2,You have made the city a pile of rocks. You have destroyed her walls. The city our enemies built with strong walls is gone. It will never be built again.
Isaiah,25,3,People from powerful nations will honor you. Cruel people from strong cities will fear you.
Isaiah,25,4,You help the poor people. You help the helpless when they are in danger. You are like a shelter from storms. You are like shade that protects them from the heat. The cruel people attack like a rainstorm beating against the wall.
Isaiah,25,5,"The cruel people burn like the heat in the desert. But you, God, stop their violent attack. As a cloud cools a hot day, Lord, you silence the songs of those who have no mercy."
Isaiah,25,6,The Lord of heaven’s armies will give a feast. It will be on this mountain for all people. It will be a feast with the best food and wine. The meat and wine will be the finest.
Isaiah,25,7,"On this mountain God will destroy the veil that covers all nations. This veil, called “death,” covers all peoples."
Isaiah,25,8,But God will destroy death forever. The Lord God will wipe away every tear from every face. God will take away the shame of his people from the earth. The Lord has spoken.
Isaiah,25,9,"At that time people will say, “Our God is doing this! We have trusted in him, and he has come to save us. We have been trusting our Lord. So we will rejoice and be happy when he saves us.”"
Isaiah,25,10,The Lord will protect Jerusalem. But the Lord will crush our enemy Moab. Moab will be like straw that is trampled down in the manure.
Isaiah,25,11,They will spread their arms in it like a person who is swimming. The Lord will bring down their pride. All the clever things they have made will mean nothing.
Isaiah,25,12,Moab’s high walls protect them. But the Lord will destroy these walls. The Lord will throw them down on the ground. The stones will lie in the dust.
Isaiah,26,1,At that time people will sing this song in Judah: We have a strong city. God protects us with its strong walls and defenses.
Isaiah,26,2,"Open the gates, and the good people will enter. They follow God’s good way of living."
Isaiah,26,3,"You, Lord, give true peace. You give peace to those who depend on you. You give peace to those who trust you."
Isaiah,26,4,"So, trust the Lord always. Trust the Lord because he is our Rock forever."
Isaiah,26,5,But the Lord will destroy the proud city. And he will punish the people living there. He will bring that high city down to the ground. He throws it down into the dust.
Isaiah,26,6,Then those who were hurt by the city will walk on its ruins. Those who were made poor by the city will trample it under their feet.
Isaiah,26,7,"The path of life of the people who are right with God is level. Lord, you make the way of life smooth for those people."
Isaiah,26,8,"But, Lord, we are waiting for your way of justice. Our souls want to remember you and your name."
Isaiah,26,9,"My soul wants to be with you at night. And my spirit wants to be with you at the dawn of every day. When your way of justice comes to the land, people of the world will learn the right way of living."
Isaiah,26,10,"An evil person will not learn to do good even if you show him kindness. He will continue doing evil, even if he lives in a good world. He never sees the Lord’s greatness."
Isaiah,26,11,"Lord, you are ready to punish those people. But they do not see that. Lord, show them your strong love for your people. Then the evil people will be ashamed. Burn them in the fire you have prepared for your enemies."
Isaiah,26,12,"Lord, all our success is because of what you have done. So give us peace."
Isaiah,26,13,"Lord, our God, other masters besides you have ruled us. But we honor only you."
Isaiah,26,14,Those masters are now dead. Their ghosts will not rise from death. You decided to destroy them. And you destroyed any memory of them.
Isaiah,26,15,"Lord, you multiplied the number of your people. You multiplied them and brought honor to yourself. You made the borders of the land wide."
Isaiah,26,16,"Lord, people remember you when they are in trouble. They say quiet prayers to you when you punish them."
Isaiah,26,17,"Lord, when we are with you, we are like a woman giving birth to a baby. She cries and has pain from the birth."
Isaiah,26,18,"In the same way, we had pain. We gave birth, but only to wind. We don’t bring salvation to the land. We don’t make new people for the world."
Isaiah,26,19,"Your people have died, but they will live again. Their bodies will rise from death. Dead people in the ground, get up and be happy! The dew covering you is like the dew of a new day. The ground will give birth to the dead buried in it."
Isaiah,26,20,"My people, go into your rooms. Shut your doors behind you. Hide in your rooms for a short time. Hide until God’s anger is finished."
Isaiah,26,21,The Lord will leave his place. He will punish the people of the world for their sins. The earth will show the blood of the people who have been killed. It will not cover the dead any longer.
Isaiah,27,1,"At that time the Lord will judge Leviathan, the gliding snake. He will punish Leviathan, the coiled snake. The Lord will use his great sword, his hard and powerful sword. He will kill the monster in the sea."
Isaiah,27,2,In that day people will sing about the pleasant vineyard.
Isaiah,27,3,"“I, the Lord, will care for that vineyard. I will water it at the right time. No one will hurt it. I will guard it day and night."
Isaiah,27,4,"I am not angry. If anyone builds a wall of thornbushes in war, I will march to it and burn it."
Isaiah,27,5,"But if anyone comes to me for safety and wants to make peace with me, he should come and make peace with me.”"
Isaiah,27,6,"In the days to come, the people of Jacob will be like a plant with good roots. Israel will grow like a plant beginning to bloom. Then the world will be filled with their children."
Isaiah,27,7,The Lord has not hurt his people as he hurt their enemies. His people have not been killed like those who tried to kill them.
Isaiah,27,8,"The Lord will settle his argument with Israel by sending it far away. Like a hot desert wind, he will drive Israel away."
Isaiah,27,9,This is how Israel’s guilt will be forgiven. This is how its sins will be taken away. Israel will crush the rocks of the altar to dust. No statues or altars will be left standing for the Asherah idols.
Isaiah,27,10,"At that time the strong, walled city will be empty. It will be like a desert. Calves will eat grass there. They will lie down there. They will eat leaves from the branches."
Isaiah,27,11,The limbs will become dry and break off. Women will use them for firewood. The people refuse to understand. So God will not comfort them. Their Maker will not be kind to them.
Isaiah,27,12,At that time the Lord will begin gathering his people one by one. He will gather all his people from the Euphrates River to the brook of Egypt. He will separate them from others as grain is separated from chaff.
Isaiah,27,13,Many of my people are now lost in Assyria. Some of my people have run away to Egypt. But at that time a great trumpet will be blown. And all those people will come back to Jerusalem. They will bow down before the Lord on that holy mountain.
Isaiah,28,1,"How terrible it will be for Samaria, the pride of Israel’s drunken people! That beautiful crown of flowers is just a dying plant. It sits on a hill above a rich valley where drunkards live."
Isaiah,28,2,"Look, the Lord has someone who is strong and full of power. That person will come like a storm of hail and strong wind. He will come like a sudden flood of water pouring over the country. He will throw Samaria down to the ground."
Isaiah,28,3,"That city, the pride of Israel’s drunken people, will be trampled underfoot."
Isaiah,28,4,"That beautiful crown of flowers is just a dying plant. It sits on a hill above a rich valley. That city will be like the first fig of summer. When a person sees it, he quickly picks it and eats it."
Isaiah,28,5,At that time the Lord of heaven’s armies will be like a beautiful crown. He will be like a wonderful crown of flowers for his people who are left alive.
Isaiah,28,6,Then the Lord will give wisdom to the judges who rule his people. The Lord will give strength to those who battle at the city gate.
Isaiah,28,7,But now those leaders are drunk with wine. They stumble from drinking too much beer. The priests and prophets are drunk with beer. They are filled with wine. They stumble from too much beer. The prophets are drunk when they see their visions. The judges stumble when they make their decisions.
Isaiah,28,8,Every table is covered with vomit. There is not a clean place anywhere.
Isaiah,28,9,The Lord is trying to teach the people a lesson. He is trying to make them understand his teachings. But the people are like little babies. They are like babies who just nursed at their mother’s breast.
Isaiah,28,10,"So they make fun of the Lord’s prophet and say: “A command here, a command there. A rule here, a rule there. A lesson here, a lesson there.”"
Isaiah,28,11,So the Lord will use strange words and foreign languages to speak to these people.
Isaiah,28,12,"God said to them, “Here is a place of rest. Let the tired people come and rest. This is the place of peace.” But the people would not listen."
Isaiah,28,13,"So the words of the Lord will be, “A command here, a command there. A rule here, a rule there. A lesson here, a lesson there.” They will fall back and will be defeated. They will be trapped and captured."
Isaiah,28,14,"You who brag should listen to the Lord’s message. Pay attention, you leaders in Jerusalem."
Isaiah,28,15,"You say, “We have made an agreement with death. We have a contract with death. When punishment passes by, it won’t hurt us. We will be safe with our lies. We will hide behind our tricks.”"
Isaiah,28,16,"Because of these things, this is what the Lord God says: “I will put a stone in the ground in Jerusalem. This will be a tested stone. Everything will be built on this important and precious rock. Anyone who trusts in it will never be disappointed."
Isaiah,28,17,I will use justice as a measuring line. I will use goodness to measure by. The lies you hide behind will be destroyed as if by hail. They will be washed away as if in a flood.
Isaiah,28,18,"Your agreement with death will be erased. Your contract with death will not help you. When punishment comes, you will be crushed by it."
Isaiah,28,19,"Whenever punishment comes, it will take you away. It will come morning after morning. It will defeat you by day and by night. Those who hear of this punishment will be terrified.”"
Isaiah,28,20,You will be like the man who tried to sleep on a bed that was too short for him. And his blanket was too narrow to wrap around himself.
Isaiah,28,21,"The Lord will fight as he did at Mount Perazim. He will be angry as he was in the Valley of Gibeon. Then the Lord will do his work, his strange work. He will finish his job, his strange job."
Isaiah,28,22,"Now, you must not make fun of these things. If you do, the ropes around you will become tighter. The Lord of heaven’s armies has told me these things. He has told me how the whole earth will be destroyed."
Isaiah,28,23,Listen closely to what I tell you. Listen carefully to what I say.
Isaiah,28,24,A farmer does not plow his field all the time. He does not go on working the soil.
Isaiah,28,25,"He prepares the ground. Then he plants the dill seed and scatters the cummin seed. He plants the wheat in rows. He plants barley in its special place, and other wheat in its own field."
Isaiah,28,26,His God teaches him and shows him the right way.
Isaiah,28,27,A farmer doesn’t use heavy boards to crush dill. He doesn’t use a wagon to crush cummin. He uses a small stick to break open the dill. With a stick he opens the cummin.
Isaiah,28,28,The grain is ground to make bread. People do not ruin it by crushing it forever. The farmer separates the wheat from the chaff with his cart. But he does not let his horses grind it.
Isaiah,28,29,This lesson comes from the Lord of heaven’s armies. He gives wonderful advice. He is very wise.
Isaiah,29,1,"How terrible it will be for you, Jerusalem. You are the city where David camped. Her festivals have continued year after year."
Isaiah,29,2,I will attack Jerusalem. That city will be filled with sadness and crying. It will be like an altar to me.
Isaiah,29,3,"I will put armies all around you, Jerusalem. I will surround you with towers. I will build devices around you to attack you."
Isaiah,29,4,You will be pulled down and will speak from the ground. I will hear your voice rising from the ground. It will sound like the voice of a ghost. Your words will come like a whisper from the dirt.
Isaiah,29,5,Your many enemies will become like fine dust. The groups of cruel people will be like chaff that is blown away. Everything will happen very quickly.
Isaiah,29,6,"The Lord of heaven’s armies will come. He will come with thunder, earthquakes and great noises. He will come with storms, strong winds and a fire that destroys."
Isaiah,29,7,Then all the nations that fight against Jerusalem will be like a dream. All the nations that surround and attack her will be like a vision in the night.
Isaiah,29,8,"They will be like a hungry man who dreams he is eating. But when he wakes up, he is still hungry. They will be like a thirsty man who dreams he is drinking. But when he wakes up, he is still weak and thirsty. It will be the same way with all the nations who fight against Mount Zion."
Isaiah,29,9,"Be surprised and amazed. Blind yourselves so that you cannot see. Become drunk, but not from wine. Trip and fall, but not from beer."
Isaiah,29,10,The Lord has made you go into a deep sleep. He has closed your eyes. (The prophets are your eyes.) He has covered your heads. (The seers are your heads.)
Isaiah,29,11,"This vision is like the words of a book that is closed and sealed. You may give the book to someone who can read. And you may tell that person to read it. But he will say, “I can’t read the book. It is closed, and I can’t open it.”"
Isaiah,29,12,"Or you may give the book to someone who cannot read. You may tell him to read the book. But he will say, “I can’t read it because I don’t know how to read.”"
Isaiah,29,13,The Lord says: “These people say they love me. They show honor to me with words. But their hearts are far from me. The honor they show me is nothing but human rules they have memorized.
Isaiah,29,14,So I will continue to amaze these people by doing more and more miracles. Their wise men will lose their wisdom. Their wise men will not be able to understand.”
Isaiah,29,15,How terrible it will be for those who try to hide things from the Lord. How terrible it will be for those who do their work in darkness. They think no one will see them or know what they do.
Isaiah,29,16,"You are confused. You think the clay is equal to the potter. You think that an object can tell the person who made it, “You didn’t make me.” This is like a pot telling its maker, “You don’t know anything.”"
Isaiah,29,17,"In a very short time, Lebanon will become rich farmland. And the rich farmland will seem like a forest."
Isaiah,29,18,"At that time the deaf will hear the words in a book. Instead of having darkness and gloom, the blind will see."
Isaiah,29,19,The Lord will make the poor people happy. They will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah,29,20,Then the people without mercy will come to an end. Those who do not respect God will disappear. Those who enjoy doing evil will be gone.
Isaiah,29,21,Those who lie about others in court will be gone. Those who trap people in court will be gone. Those who lie and take justice from innocent people in court will be gone.
Isaiah,29,22,The Lord set Abraham free. This Lord speaks to the family of Jacob. “Now the people of Jacob will not be ashamed. They will not be disgraced any longer.
Isaiah,29,23,"They will see all their children, the children I made with my hands. And they will say my name is holy. The people will agree that the Holy One of Jacob is holy. They will respect the God of Israel."
Isaiah,29,24,People who do wrong will now understand. Those who complain will accept being taught.”
Isaiah,30,1,"The Lord said, “How terrible it will be for these stubborn children. They make plans, but they don’t ask me to help them. They make agreements with other nations, without asking my Spirit. They are adding more and more sins to themselves."
Isaiah,30,2,"They go down to Egypt for help, but they didn’t ask me about it first. They hope they will be saved by the king of Egypt. They want Egypt to protect them."
Isaiah,30,3,But hiding in Egypt will bring you only shame. Egypt’s protection will only disappoint you.
Isaiah,30,4,Your officers have gone to Zoan. Your messengers have gone to Hanes.
Isaiah,30,5,"But they will be put to shame, because Egypt is useless to them. Egypt will give no help and be of no use. It will cause them only shame and embarrassment.”"
Isaiah,30,6,"This is the message about the animals in southern Judah: Southern Judah is a dangerous place. It is full of lions and lionesses, poisonous snakes and darting snakes. The messengers travel through there with their wealth on donkeys’ backs. They have put their treasure on the backs of camels. They carry them to a nation that cannot help them."
Isaiah,30,7,They go to Egypt whose help is useless. So I call that country Rahab the Do-Nothing.
Isaiah,30,8,Now write this on a sign for the people. Write this on a scroll. Write these things for the days to come. Write them so they will last forever.
Isaiah,30,9,These people are like children who lie and refuse to obey. They refuse to listen to the Lord’s teachings.
Isaiah,30,10,"They tell the seers, “Don’t see any more visions!” They say to the prophets, “Don’t tell us the truth! Say things that will make us feel good. See only good things for us."
Isaiah,30,11,"Stop blocking our path. Get out of our way. Stop telling us about God, the Holy One of Israel.”"
Isaiah,30,12,So this is what the Holy One of Israel says: “You people have refused to accept this message from the Lord. You depended on cruelty and lies to help you.
Isaiah,30,13,You are guilty of these things. So you are like a high wall with cracks in it. It will fall suddenly and break into small pieces.
Isaiah,30,14,You will be like a clay jar that breaks. It breaks into many pieces. Those pieces will be too small to take coals from the fire or to get water from a well.”
Isaiah,30,15,"This is what the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, says: “If you come back to me and trust me, you will be saved. If you will be calm and trust me, you will be strong.” But you don’t want to do that."
Isaiah,30,16,"You say, “No, we need horses to run away on.” So you will run away on horses. You say, “We will ride away on fast horses.” So those who chase you will be fast."
Isaiah,30,17,"One enemy will make threats, and 1,000 of your men will run away. Five enemies will make threats, and all of you will run from them. You will be left alone like a flagpole on a hilltop. You will be like a banner on a hill."
Isaiah,30,18,The Lord wants to show his mercy to you. He wants to rise and comfort you. The Lord is a fair God. And everyone who waits for his help will be happy.
Isaiah,30,19,"You people who live on Mount Zion in Jerusalem will not cry anymore. The Lord will hear your crying, and he will comfort you. The Lord will hear you, and he will help you."
Isaiah,30,20,"The Lord has given you sorrow and hurt. It was like the bread and water you ate every day. But he is your teacher, and he will not continue to hide from you. You will see your teacher with your own eyes."
Isaiah,30,21,"If you go the wrong way—to the right or to the left—you will hear a voice behind you. It will say, “This is the right way. You should go this way.”"
Isaiah,30,22,"You have statues covered with silver and gold. But you will ruin them for further use. You will throw them away like filthy rags. You will say, “Go away!”"
Isaiah,30,23,"At that time the Lord will send rain for you. You will plant seeds in the ground, and the ground will grow food for you. The harvest will be very great. You will have plenty of food in the fields for your animals. There will be large fields for your sheep."
Isaiah,30,24,Your oxen and donkeys will work the soil. They will have all the food they need. You will have to use shovels and pitchforks to spread all the food for your animals to eat.
Isaiah,30,25,Every mountain and hill will have streams filled with water. These things will happen after many people are killed and the towers are pulled down.
Isaiah,30,26,At that time the light from the moon will be bright like the sun. The light from the sun will be seven times brighter than now. The light from the sun in one day will be like a full week. These things will happen when the Lord bandages his broken people and heals the hurts he gave them.
Isaiah,30,27,"Look! The Lord comes from far away. His anger is like a fire with thick clouds of smoke. His mouth is filled with anger, and his tongue is like a burning fire."
Isaiah,30,28,The Lord’s breath is like a rushing river. It rises until it reaches the throat. He will judge the nations as if he is sifting them through the strainer of destruction. He will place in their mouths a bit that will lead them the wrong way.
Isaiah,30,29,You will sing happy songs as on the nights you begin a festival. You will be happy as people listening to flutes as they go to the mountain of the Lord. The Lord is the Rock of Israel.
Isaiah,30,30,The Lord will cause all people to hear his great voice. He will cause them to see his powerful arm come down. It will come with anger like a great fire that burns everything. It will be like a great storm with much rain and hail.
Isaiah,30,31,Assyria will be afraid when it hears the voice of the Lord. The Lord will beat Assyria with a rod.
Isaiah,30,32,The Lord will punish Assyria with a rod. He will beat them to the music of tambourines and harps. The Lord will fight against them with his mighty weapons.
Isaiah,30,33,Topheth has been made ready for a long time. It is ready for the king. It was made deep and wide. There is much wood and fire there. And the Lord’s breath will come like a stream of burning sulfur and burn it.
Isaiah,31,1,"How terrible it will be for those people who go down to Egypt for help. They think horses will save them. They think their many chariots and strong horsemen will save them. They don’t trust God, the Holy One of Israel. They don’t ask the Lord for help."
Isaiah,31,2,But it is the Lord who is wise and who can bring them trouble. He does not change his warnings. He will rise up and fight against the evil people. And he will fight against those who try to help evil people.
Isaiah,31,3,"The Egyptians are only people and are not God. Their horses are only animals and are not spirit. The Lord will stretch out his arm, and the one who helps will stumble. The people who wanted help will fall. All of them will be destroyed together."
Isaiah,31,4,"The Lord says this to me: “When a lion or a lion’s cub kills an animal to eat, it stands over the dead animal and roars. A band of shepherds may be assembled against it. But the lion will not be afraid of their yelling. It will not be upset by their noise. So the Lord of heaven’s armies will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its hill."
Isaiah,31,5,The Lord of heaven’s armies will defend Jerusalem. He will defend it like birds flying over their nests. He will defend and save it. He will ‘pass over’ and save Jerusalem.”
Isaiah,31,6,"You children of Israel, come back to the God that you fought against."
Isaiah,31,7,The time is coming when each of you will stop worshiping the idols of gold and silver that you made. You truly sinned when you made them.
Isaiah,31,8,"“Assyria will be defeated by a sword, but not the sword of a man. Assyria will be destroyed, but not by a man’s sword. Assyria will run away from the sword of God. But their young men will be caught and made slaves."
Isaiah,31,9,"They will panic, and their place of safety will be destroyed. Their commanders will be terrified when they see God’s battle flag.” The Lord said all these things. The Lord’s fire is in Jerusalem. His furnace is in Jerusalem."
Isaiah,32,1,A king will rule in a way that brings justice. Leaders will make fair decisions.
Isaiah,32,2,Then each ruler will be like a shelter from the wind. He will be like a safe place in a storm. He will be like streams of water in a dry land. He will be like a cool shadow from a large rock in a hot land.
Isaiah,32,3,People will look to the king for help. And they will truly listen to what he says.
Isaiah,32,4,People who are now worried will be able to understand. Those who cannot speak clearly now will then be able to speak clearly and quickly.
Isaiah,32,5,Fools will not be called great men. People will not respect wicked men.
Isaiah,32,6,A fool says foolish things. And in his mind he plans to do evil things. A fool wants to do things that are wrong. He says wrong things about the Lord. A fool does not feed the hungry. He does not let thirsty people drink water.
Isaiah,32,7,"The wicked man uses evil like a tool. He plans ways to take everything from poor people. He destroys the poor with lies, even when the poor man is in the right."
Isaiah,32,8,But a good leader plans good things to do. And those good things make him a good leader.
Isaiah,32,9,"You women who are calm now, stand up and listen to me. You women who feel safe now, hear what I say."
Isaiah,32,10,"You women feel safe now, but after one year you will be afraid. There will be no grape harvest. There will not be any summer fruit to gather."
Isaiah,32,11,"Women, you are calm now, but you should shake with fear. Women, you feel safe now, but you should tremble. Take off your nice clothes. Then put rough cloth around your waist to show your sadness."
Isaiah,32,12,Beat your breasts in grief because the fields that were pleasant are now empty. Cry because the vines that once had fruit now have no more grapes.
Isaiah,32,13,Cry for the land of my people. Cry because only thorns and weeds grow there now. Cry for the city that once was happy. And cry for all the houses that once were filled with joy.
Isaiah,32,14,The palace will be empty. People will leave the noisy city. Strong cities and towers will be empty. Wild donkeys will love to live there. Sheep will go there to eat.
Isaiah,32,15,This will continue until God puts his Spirit from above into us. Then the desert will be like a fertile field. And the fertile field will be like a forest.
Isaiah,32,16,Justice will be found even in the desert. And fairness will be found in the fertile fields.
Isaiah,32,17,That fairness will bring peace. And fairness will bring calm and safety forever.
Isaiah,32,18,My people will live in peaceful places. They will have safe homes. They will live in calm places of rest.
Isaiah,32,19,Hail will destroy the forest. And the city will be completely destroyed.
Isaiah,32,20,But you will be happy as you plant seeds near every stream. You will let your cattle and donkeys wander freely.
Isaiah,33,1,"How terrible it will be for you who destroy others. But you have not been destroyed yet. How terrible it will be for you, traitor. But no one has turned against you yet. When you stop destroying, others will destroy you. When you stop turning against others, they will turn against you."
Isaiah,33,2,"Lord, be kind to us. We have waited for your help. Lord, give us strength every morning. Save us when we are in trouble."
Isaiah,33,3,Your powerful voice makes people run away in fear. Your greatness causes the nations to run away.

Isaiah,33,6,"The Lord will be your safety. He is full of salvation, wisdom and knowledge. Respect for the Lord is the greatest treasure."
Isaiah,33,7,"See, brave men are crying out in the streets. Those who tried to bring peace are crying loudly."
Isaiah,33,8,There is no one on the roads. No one is walking in the paths. People have broken the agreements they made. People refuse to believe the proof from witnesses. No one respects other people.
Isaiah,33,9,The land is sick and dying. Lebanon is ashamed and dying. The Plain of Sharon is dry like the desert. The trees of Bashan and Carmel are dying.
Isaiah,33,10,"The Lord says, “Now, I will stand up and show my greatness. Now, I will become important to the people."
Isaiah,33,11,You people do useless things. These things are like hay and straw. A destructive wind will burn you like fire.
Isaiah,33,12,People will be burned until their bones become like lime. They will burn quickly like dry thornbushes.”
Isaiah,33,13,"You people in faraway lands, hear what I have done. You people who are near me, learn about my power."
Isaiah,33,14,"The sinners in Jerusalem are afraid. The people who are separated from God shake with fear. They say, “Can any of us live through this fire that destroys? Who can live near this fire that burns on and on?”"
Isaiah,33,15,A person might do what is right. He might speak what is right. He might refuse to take money unfairly. He might refuse to take money to hurt others. He might not listen to plans of murder. He might refuse to think about evil.
Isaiah,33,16,"This is the kind of person who will be safe. He will be protected as he would be in a high, walled city. He will always have bread, and he will not run out of water."
Isaiah,33,17,Your eyes will see the king in his beauty. You will see the land that stretches far away.
Isaiah,33,18,"You will think about the terror of the past. You will think, “Where is that officer? Where is the one who collected the taxes? Where is the officer in charge of our defense towers?”"
Isaiah,33,19,You will not see those proud people from other countries anymore. No more will you hear their strange language that you couldn’t understand.
Isaiah,33,20,"Look at Jerusalem, the city of our festivals. Look at Jerusalem, that beautiful place of rest. It is like a tent that will never be moved. The pegs that hold her in place will never be moved. Her ropes will never be broken."
Isaiah,33,21,There the Lord will be our Mighty One. That land is a place with streams and wide rivers. But there will be no enemy boats on those rivers. No powerful ship will sail on those rivers.
Isaiah,33,22,This is because the Lord is our judge. The Lord makes our laws. The Lord is our king. He will save us.
Isaiah,33,23,"You sailors from other lands, hear: The ropes on your boats hang loose. The mast is not held firm. The sails are not spread open. The Lord will give us your wealth. There will be so much wealth even the crippled people will carry off a share."
Isaiah,33,24,"No one living in Jerusalem will say, “I am sick.” The people who live there will have their sins forgiven."
Isaiah,34,1,"All you nations, come near and listen. Pay attention, you peoples! The earth and all the people in it should listen. The world and everything in it should listen."
Isaiah,34,2,The Lord is angry with all the nations. He is angry with their armies. He will destroy them and kill them all.
Isaiah,34,3,"Their bodies will be thrown outside. The stink will rise from the bodies, and the blood will flow down the mountains."
Isaiah,34,4,"The sun, moon and stars will dissolve. The sky will be rolled up like a scroll. The stars will fall like dead leaves from a vine or dried-up figs from a fig tree."
Isaiah,34,5,The Lord’s sword in the sky is covered with blood. It will cut through Edom. He will destroy these people as an offering to the Lord.
Isaiah,34,6,The Lord’s sword will be covered with blood. It will be covered with fat. It is the blood from lambs and goats. It is the fat from the kidneys of male sheep. This is because the Lord decided there will be a sacrifice in Bozrah. He has decided there will be much killing in Edom.
Isaiah,34,7,The oxen will be killed. And the cattle and the strong bulls will be killed. The land will be filled with their blood. The dirt will be covered with their fat.
Isaiah,34,8,The Lord has chosen a time for punishment. He has chosen a year when people must pay for the wrongs they did to Jerusalem.
Isaiah,34,9,Edom’s rivers will be like hot tar. The dirt of Edom will be like burning sulfur. The land of Edom will be like burning tar.
Isaiah,34,10,The fires will burn night and day. The smoke will rise from Edom forever. Year after year that land will be empty. No one will ever travel through that land again.
Isaiah,34,11,Birds and small animals will own that land. Owls and ravens will live there. God will make it an empty wasteland. It will have nothing left in it.
Isaiah,34,12,The important men will have no one left to rule them. The leaders will all be gone.
Isaiah,34,13,Thorns will take over the strong towers. Wild bushes will grow in the walled cities. Wild dogs will live there. Owls will live in those homes.
Isaiah,34,14,Desert animals will live with the hyenas there. And wild goats will call to their friends. Night animals will live there. They will find a place of rest there.
Isaiah,34,15,"Owls will nest there and lay eggs. When the eggs open, the owls will gather their young under their wings. Hawks will gather with their own kind."
Isaiah,34,16,Look at the Lord’s scroll. Read what is written there: None of these will be missing. Every one will have its mate. God said he will gather them together. So his Spirit will gather them together.
Isaiah,34,17,God has divided the land among them. And he has given them each their land. So they will own that land forever. They will live there year after year.
Isaiah,35,1,"The desert and dry land will become happy. The desert will be glad and will produce flowers. Like a flower,"
Isaiah,35,2,"it will have many blooms. It will show its happiness, as if it is shouting with joy. It will be beautiful like the forest of Lebanon. It will be as beautiful as the hill of Carmel and the Plain of Sharon. All people will see the glory of the Lord. They will see the splendor of our God."
Isaiah,35,3,Make the weak hands strong. Make the weak knees strong.
Isaiah,35,4,"Say to people who are afraid and confused, “Be strong. Don’t be afraid. Look, your God will come, and he will punish your enemies. He will make them pay for the wrongs they did. He will come and save you.”"
Isaiah,35,5,Then the blind people will see again. Then the deaf will hear.
Isaiah,35,6,Crippled people will jump like deer. And those who can’t talk now will shout with joy. Springs of water will flow in the desert. Streams will flow in the dry land.
Isaiah,35,7,"The burning desert will have pools of water. The dry ground will have springs. Where wild dogs once lived, grass and water plants will grow."
Isaiah,35,8,A road will be there. This highway will be called “The Road to Being Holy.” Evil people will not be allowed to walk on that road. Only good people will walk on that road. No fools will go on it.
Isaiah,35,9,No lions will be there. No dangerous animals will be on that road. They will not be found there. That road will be for the people God saves.
Isaiah,35,10,The people the Lord has freed will return there. They will enter Jerusalem with joy. Their happiness will last forever. Their gladness and joy will fill them completely. Sorrow and sadness will go far away.
Isaiah,36,1,"During Hezekiah’s fourteenth year as king, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked Judah. He attacked all the strong, walled cities of Judah and defeated them."
Isaiah,36,2,"The king of Assyria sent out his field commander. He went with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. When the commander came near the waterway from the upper pool, he stopped. The upper pool is on the road to the Washerman’s Field."
Isaiah,36,3,"Eliakim, Shebna and Joah went out to meet him. Eliakim son of Hilkiah was the palace manager. Shebna was the royal assistant. And Joah son of Asaph was the recorder."
Isaiah,36,4,"The field commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah this: “‘The great king, the king of Assyria, says: You have nothing to trust in to help you."
Isaiah,36,5,You say you have battle plans and power for war. But your words mean nothing. Whom are you trusting for help so that you turn against me?
Isaiah,36,6,"Look, you are depending on Egypt to help you. Egypt is like a splintered walking stick. If you lean on it for help, it will stab you and hurt you. The king of Egypt will hurt those who depend on him."
Isaiah,36,7,"You might say, “We are depending on the Lord our God.” But Hezekiah destroyed the Lord’s altars and the places of worship. Hezekiah told Judah and Jerusalem, “You must worship only at this one altar.”"
Isaiah,36,8,"“‘Now make an agreement with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you 2,000 horses if you can find enough men to ride them."
Isaiah,36,9,You cannot defeat one of my master’s least important officers. So why do you depend on Egypt to give you chariots and horsemen?
Isaiah,36,10,I have not come to attack and destroy this country without an order from the Lord. The Lord himself told me to come to this country and destroy it.’”
Isaiah,36,11,"Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah spoke to the field commander. They said, “Please speak to us in the Aramaic language. We understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew because the people on the city wall can hear you.”"
Isaiah,36,12,"But the commander said, “No. My master did not send me to tell these things only to you and your king. My master sent me to tell them also to those people sitting on the wall. They will have to eat their own dung and drink their own urine like you.”"
Isaiah,36,13,"Then the commander stood and shouted loudly in the Hebrew language. He said, “Listen to the words from the great king, the king of Assyria!"
Isaiah,36,14,The king says you should not let Hezekiah fool you. Hezekiah can’t save you.
Isaiah,36,15,"Don’t let Hezekiah talk you into trusting the Lord. Hezekiah says, ‘The Lord will surely save us. This city won’t be given over to the king of Assyria.’"
Isaiah,36,16,"“Don’t listen to Hezekiah. The king of Assyria says, ‘Make peace with me. Come out of the city to me. Then everyone will be free to eat the fruit from his own grapevine and fig tree. Everyone will be free to drink water from his own well."
Isaiah,36,17,Then I will come and take you to a land like your own. It is a land with grain and new wine. It has bread and vineyards.’
Isaiah,36,18,"“Don’t let Hezekiah fool you. He says, ‘The Lord will save us.’ The god of any other nation has not saved his people from the power of the king of Assyria."
Isaiah,36,19,Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? They did not save Samaria from my power.
Isaiah,36,20,Not one of all the gods of these countries has saved his people from me. Then the Lord cannot save Jerusalem from my power.”
Isaiah,36,21,"The people were silent. They didn’t answer the commander at all. This was because King Hezekiah had ordered, “Don’t answer him.”"
Isaiah,36,22,"Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah tore their clothes to show how upset they were. (Eliakim son of Hilkiah was the palace manager. Shebna was the royal assistant. And Joah son of Asaph was the recorder.) The three men went to Hezekiah and told him what the field commander had said."
Isaiah,37,1,"When King Hezekiah heard the message, he tore his clothes. And he put on rough cloth to show how sad he was. Then he went into the Temple of the Lord."
Isaiah,37,2,"Hezekiah sent Eliakim, Shebna and the older priests to Isaiah. Eliakim was the palace manager, and Shebna was the royal assistant. The men were all wearing the rough cloth when they came to Isaiah. He was a prophet, the son of Amoz."
Isaiah,37,3,"These men told Isaiah, “This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day of sorrow and punishment and disgrace. It is sad, as when a child should be born, but the mother is not strong enough to give birth to it."
Isaiah,37,4,The king of Assyria sent his field commander to make fun of the living God. Maybe the Lord your God will hear what the commander said. Maybe the Lord your God will punish him for what he said. So pray for the few people of Israel who are left alive.”
Isaiah,37,5,"When Hezekiah’s officers came to Isaiah,"
Isaiah,37,6,"he said to them, “Tell your master this: The Lord says, ‘Don’t be afraid of what you have heard. Don’t be frightened by the words the servants of the king of Assyria said against me."
Isaiah,37,7,Listen! I am going to put a spirit in the king of Assyria. He will hear a report that will make him return to his own country. And I will cause him to die by the sword there.’”
Isaiah,37,8,The field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish. So the commander left and found the king fighting against the city of Libnah.
Isaiah,37,9,"The king received a report that Tirhakah was coming to attack him. Tirhakah was the Cushite king of Egypt. When the king of Assyria heard this, he sent messengers to Hezekiah. The king said:"
Isaiah,37,10,“Say this to Hezekiah king of Judah: Don’t be fooled by the god you trust. Don’t believe him when he says Jerusalem will not be defeated by the king of Assyria.
Isaiah,37,11,You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done. They have completely defeated every country. Do not think you will be saved.
Isaiah,37,12,"The gods of those people did not save them. My ancestors destroyed them. My ancestors defeated the cities of Gozan, Haran and Rezeph. They defeated the people of Eden living in Tel Assar."
Isaiah,37,13,Where are the kings of Hamath and Arpad? Where is the king of the city of Sepharvaim? Where are the kings of Hena and Ivvah?”
Isaiah,37,14,Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the Temple of the Lord. Hezekiah spread the letter out before the Lord.
Isaiah,37,15,And he prayed to the Lord:
Isaiah,37,16,"“Lord of heaven’s armies, you are the God of Israel. Your throne is between the gold creatures with wings. Only you are the God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heavens and the earth."
Isaiah,37,17,"Hear, Lord, and listen. Open your eyes, Lord, and see. Listen to all the words Sennacherib has said to insult the living God."
Isaiah,37,18,"“It is true, Lord. The kings of Assyria have destroyed all these countries and their lands."
Isaiah,37,19,These kings have thrown the gods of these nations into the fire. But they were only wood and rock statues that men made. So the kings have destroyed them.
Isaiah,37,20,"Now, Lord our God, save us from the king’s power. Then all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you, Lord, are the only God.”"
Isaiah,37,21,"Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah. Isaiah said, “The Lord, the God of Israel, says this: ‘You prayed to me about Sennacherib king of Assyria."
Isaiah,37,22,So this is what the Lord has said against Sennacherib: The people of Jerusalem hate you and make fun of you. The people of Jerusalem laugh at you as you run away.
Isaiah,37,23,"You have insulted me and spoken against me. You have raised your voice against me. You have a proud look on your face. You disobey me, the Holy One of Israel!"
Isaiah,37,24,"You have used your messengers to insult the Lord. You have said, “I have many chariots. With them I have gone to the tops of the mountains. I have climbed the highest mountains of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars. I have cut down its best pine trees. I have gone to its greatest heights. I have gone to its best forests."
Isaiah,37,25,"I have dug wells in foreign countries. I have drunk water there. By the soles of my feet, I have dried up all the rivers of Egypt.”"
Isaiah,37,26,"“‘King of Assyria, surely you have heard. Long ago I, the Lord, planned these things. Long ago I planned them. Now I have made them happen. I allowed you to turn those strong, walled cities into piles of rocks."
Isaiah,37,27,"The people living in those cities were weak. They were frightened and put to shame. They were like grass in the field. They were like tender, young grass. They were like grass that grows on the housetop. It is burned by the wind before it can grow."
Isaiah,37,28,“‘I know when you rest and when you come and go. I know how you speak against me.
Isaiah,37,29,You speak strongly against me. And I have heard your proud words. So I will put my hook in your nose. And I will put my bit in your mouth. Then I will force you to leave my country the same way that you came.’
Isaiah,37,30,"“Then the Lord said, ‘Hezekiah, I will give you this sign: This year you will eat the grain that grows wild. And the second year you will eat what grows wild from that. But in the third year, plant grain and harvest it. Plant vineyards and eat their fruit."
Isaiah,37,31,"The people left alive in the family of Judah will be saved. Like plants that take root, they will grow strong and have many children."
Isaiah,37,32,A few people will come out of Jerusalem alive. There will be a few from Mount Zion who will live. The strong love of the Lord of heaven’s armies will cause this to happen.’
Isaiah,37,33,“So this is what the Lord says about the king of Assyria: ‘He will not enter this city. He will not even shoot an arrow here. He will not fight against it with shields. He will not build a ramp to attack the city walls.
Isaiah,37,34,"He will return to his country the same way he came. He will not enter this city,’ says the Lord."
Isaiah,37,35,"The Lord says, ‘I will defend and save this city. I will do this for myself and for David, my servant.’”"
Isaiah,37,36,"Then the angel of the Lord went out. He killed 185,000 men in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up early the next morning, they saw all the dead bodies!"
Isaiah,37,37,So Sennacherib king of Assyria left. He went back to Nineveh and stayed there.
Isaiah,37,38,"One day Sennacherib was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch. While he was there, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with a sword. Then they escaped to the land of Ararat. So Sennacherib’s son Esarhaddon became king of Assyria."
Isaiah,38,1,"At that time Hezekiah became very sick. He was almost dead. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to see him. Isaiah told him, “This is what the Lord says: You are going to die. So you should give your last orders to everyone. You will not get well.”"
Isaiah,38,2,Hezekiah turned toward the wall and prayed to the Lord.
Isaiah,38,3,"He said, “Lord, please remember that I have always obeyed you. I have given myself completely to you. I have done what you said was right.” And Hezekiah cried loudly."
Isaiah,38,4,Then the Lord spoke his word to Isaiah:
Isaiah,38,5,"“Go to Hezekiah and tell him: ‘This is what the Lord, the God of your ancestor David, says: I have heard your prayer. And I have seen your tears. I will add 15 years to your life."
Isaiah,38,6,I will save you and this city from the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.’”
Isaiah,38,7,"Isaiah said, “The Lord will do what he says. This is the sign from the Lord to show you:"
Isaiah,38,8,The sun has made a shadow go down the stairway of Ahaz. I will make it go back ten steps.” So the shadow made by the sun went back up the ten steps it had gone down.
Isaiah,38,9,"After Hezekiah king of Judah got well, he wrote this song:"
Isaiah,38,10,"I said, “I am in the middle of my life. Do I have to go through the gates where the dead are now? Will I have the rest of my life taken away from me?”"
Isaiah,38,11,"I said, “I will not see the Lord in the land of the living again. I will not again see the people who live on the earth."
Isaiah,38,12,"Like a shepherd’s tent, my home has been pulled down and taken from me. I am finished like the cloth a weaver rolls up and cuts from the loom. In one day you brought me to this end."
Isaiah,38,13,"All night I cried loudly. Like a lion, he crushed all my bones. In one day you brought me to this end."
Isaiah,38,14,"I cried like a bird. I moaned like a dove. My eyes became tired as I looked to the heavens. Lord, I have troubles. Please help me.”"
Isaiah,38,15,What can I say? The Lord told me what would happen and then made it happen. I have had these troubles in my soul. So now I will be humble all my life.
Isaiah,38,16,"Lord, because of you, men live. Because of you, my spirit also lives. You made me well and let me live."
Isaiah,38,17,"It was for my own good that I had such troubles. Because you love me very much, you did not let me die. You threw my sins far away."
Isaiah,38,18,People in the place where the dead are cannot praise you. Those who have died cannot sing praises to you. Those who die don’t trust you to help them.
Isaiah,38,19,The people who are alive are the ones who praise you. They praise you as I praise you today. A father should tell his children that you provide help.
Isaiah,38,20,The Lord saved me. So we will sing and play songs. We will make music in the Temple of the Lord all the days of our lives.
Isaiah,38,21,"Then Isaiah said, “Make a paste from figs. Put it on Hezekiah’s boil. Then he will get well.”"
Isaiah,38,22,"Hezekiah asked Isaiah, “What will be the sign? What will show that I will go up to the Temple of the Lord?”"
Isaiah,39,1,At that time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan was king of Babylon. He sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah. He did this because he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick and was now well.
Isaiah,39,2,"Hezekiah was happy to see the messengers. So he showed them what was in his storehouses: the silver, gold, spices and expensive perfumes. He showed them his swords and shields. He showed them all his wealth. He showed them everything in his palace and in his kingdom."
Isaiah,39,3,"Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah. He asked Hezekiah, “What did these men say? Where did they come from?” Hezekiah said, “They came from a faraway country. They came to me from Babylon.”"
Isaiah,39,4,"So Isaiah asked him, “What did they see in your palace?” Hezekiah said, “They saw everything in my palace. I showed them all my wealth.”"
Isaiah,39,5,Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah: “Listen to the words of the Lord of heaven’s armies:
Isaiah,39,6,"‘In the future everything in your palace will be taken away to Babylon. Everything your ancestors have stored up until this day will be taken away. Nothing will be left,’ says the Lord."
Isaiah,39,7,Some of your own children will be taken away. Those who will be born to you will be taken away. And they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
Isaiah,39,8,"Hezekiah told Isaiah, “These words from the Lord are good.” He said this because he thought, “There will be peace and security while I am king.”"
Isaiah,40,1,"Your God says, “Comfort, comfort my people."
Isaiah,40,2,Speak kindly to the people of Jerusalem. Tell them that their time of service is finished. Tell them that they have paid for their sins. Tell them that the Lord has punished Jerusalem twice for every sin they did.”
Isaiah,40,3,This is the voice of a man who calls out: “Prepare in the desert the way for the Lord. Make the road in the dry lands straight for our God.
Isaiah,40,4,Every valley should be raised up. Every mountain and hill should be made flat. The rough ground should be made level. The rugged ground should be made smooth.
Isaiah,40,5,Then the glory of the Lord will be shown. All people together will see it. The Lord himself said these things.”
Isaiah,40,6,"A voice says, “Cry out!” Then I said, “What shall I cry out?” “Say all people are like the grass. And all their strength is like the flowers of the field."
Isaiah,40,7,"The grass dies, and the flowers fall. This is because the breath of the Lord blows on them. Surely the people are like grass."
Isaiah,40,8,"The grass dies, and the flowers fall. But the word of our God will live forever.”"
Isaiah,40,9,"Jerusalem, you have good news to tell. Go up on a high mountain. Jerusalem, you have good news to tell. Shout out loud the good news. Shout it out and don’t be afraid. Say to the towns of Judah, “Here is your God.”"
Isaiah,40,10,"Look, the Lord God is coming with power. He will use his power to rule all the people. Look, he will bring reward for his people. He will have their payment with him."
Isaiah,40,11,The Lord takes care of his people like a shepherd. He gathers the people like lambs in his arms. He carries them close to him. He gently leads the mothers of the lambs.
Isaiah,40,12,Who has measured the oceans in the palm of his hand? Who has used his hand to measure the sky? Who has used a bowl to measure all the dust of the earth? Who has used scales to weigh the mountains and hills?
Isaiah,40,13,Who has known the mind of the Lord? Who has been able to give the Lord advice?
Isaiah,40,14,Whom did the Lord ask for help? Who taught him the right way? Who taught the Lord knowledge? Who showed him the way to understanding?
Isaiah,40,15,The nations are like one small drop in a bucket. They are no more than the dust on his measuring scales. To him the islands are no more than fine dust on his scales.
Isaiah,40,16,All the trees in Lebanon are not enough for the altar fires. And all the animals in Lebanon are not enough for burnt offerings.
Isaiah,40,17,Compared to the Lord all the nations are worth nothing. To him they are less than nothing.
Isaiah,40,18,Can you compare God to anything? Can you compare him to an image of anything?
Isaiah,40,19,An idol is formed by a man. And another man covers it with gold. And he makes silver chains for it.
Isaiah,40,20,A poor man cannot buy those expensive statues. So he finds a tree that will not rot. And he finds a skilled workman to make it into an idol that will not fall over.
Isaiah,40,21,Surely you know. Surely you have heard. Surely in the beginning someone told you. Surely you understand how the earth was created.
Isaiah,40,22,"God sits on his throne above the circle of the earth. And compared to him, people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the skies like a piece of cloth. He spreads them out like a tent to sit under."
Isaiah,40,23,He makes rulers unimportant. He makes the judges of this world worth nothing.
Isaiah,40,24,"They are like plants that are placed in the ground. They are like seeds that are planted. As soon as they begin to grow strong, he blows on them and they die. The wind blows them away like chaff."
Isaiah,40,25,"God, the Holy One, says, “Can you compare me to anyone? Is anyone equal to me?”"
Isaiah,40,26,Look up to the skies. Who created all these stars? He leads out all the army of heaven one by one. He calls all the stars by name. He is very strong and full of power. So not one of them is missing.
Isaiah,40,27,"People of Jacob, why do you complain? People of Israel, why do you say, “The Lord does not see what happens to me. He does not care if I am treated fairly”?"
Isaiah,40,28,Surely you know. Surely you have heard. The Lord is the God who lives forever. He created all the world. He does not become tired or need to rest. No one can understand how great his wisdom is.
Isaiah,40,29,The Lord gives strength to those who are tired. He gives more power to those who are weak.
Isaiah,40,30,Even boys become tired and need to rest. Even young men trip and fall.

Isaiah,41,2,"“Who caused the man to come from the east? Who gives the man victories everywhere he goes? The one who brought him gives nations over to him. He defeats kings for him. The man uses his sword, and the kings become like dust. He uses his bow, and they are blown away like chaff."
Isaiah,41,3,He chases them and is never hurt. He goes places where he has never been before.
Isaiah,41,4,"Who caused this to happen? Who has controlled history since the beginning? I, the Lord, am the one. I was here at the beginning. And I will be here when all things are finished.”"
Isaiah,41,5,"All you faraway places, look and be afraid. All you places far away on the earth, shake with fear. Come close and listen to me."
Isaiah,41,6,"The workers help each other. They say to each other, “Be strong!”"
Isaiah,41,7,"The man who carves wood encourages the man who works with gold. The workman who smooths the metal with a hammer encourages the man who shapes the metal. This last workman says, “This metal work is good.” He nails the statue to a base so it can’t fall over."
Isaiah,41,8,"The Lord says, “People of Israel, you are my servants. People of Jacob, I chose you. You are from the family of my friend Abraham."
Isaiah,41,9,"You were far away on the earth. I called you from a faraway country. I said, ‘You are my servants.’ I have chosen you, and I have not turned against you."
Isaiah,41,10,"So don’t worry, because I am with you. Don’t be afraid, because I am your God. I will make you strong and will help you. I will support you with my right hand that saves you."
Isaiah,41,11,“All those people who are angry with you will be ashamed and disgraced. Those who are against you will disappear and be lost.

Isaiah,41,19,"I will make trees grow in the desert. There will be cedars, acacia, myrtle and olive trees. I will put pine, fir and cypress trees growing together in the desert."

Isaiah,41,21,"The Lord says, “Present your case.” The Lord, the King of Jacob, says, “Tell me your arguments."
Isaiah,41,22,Bring in your idols to tell us what is going to happen. Have them tell us what happened in the beginning. Then we will think about these things. Then we will know how they will turn out. Tell us what will happen in the future.
Isaiah,41,23,"Tell us what is coming next. Then we will believe that you are gods. Do something, whether it is good or bad. Make us afraid of you."
Isaiah,41,24,You false gods are less than nothing. You can’t do anything. Those who worship you should be hated.”
Isaiah,41,25,"“I have brought someone to come out of the north. I have called by name a man from the east, and he knows me. He walks on kings as if they were mud. He walks on them as a potter walks on the clay."
Isaiah,41,26,"Who told us about this before it happened? Who told us ahead of time so we could say, ‘He was right’? None of you told us anything. None of you told us before it happened. No one heard you tell about it."
Isaiah,41,27,"I, the Lord, was the first one to tell Jerusalem that the people were coming home. I sent a messenger to Jerusalem with the good news."
Isaiah,41,28,"I look at the idols, but there is not one that can answer. None of them can give advice. None of them can answer my questions."
Isaiah,41,29,"Look, all these idols are false gods. They cannot do anything. They are worth nothing."
Isaiah,42,1,"“Here is my servant, the one I support. He is the one I chose, and I am pleased with him. I will put my Spirit in him. And he will bring justice to all nations."
Isaiah,42,2,He will not cry out or yell. He will not speak loudly in the streets.
Isaiah,42,3,He will not break a crushed blade of grass. He will not put out even a weak flame. He will bring justice and find what is true.
Isaiah,42,4,He will not lose hope or give up until he brings justice to the world. And people far away will trust his teachings.”
Isaiah,42,5,"God, the Lord, said these things. He created the skies and stretched them out. He spread out the earth and everything on it. He gives life to all people on earth. He gives life to everyone who walks on the earth."
Isaiah,42,6,"The Lord says, “I called you to do right. And I will hold your hand. I will protect you. You will be the sign of my agreement with the people. You will be a light to shine for all people."
Isaiah,42,7,You will help the blind to see. You will free those who are in prison. You will lead those who live in darkness out of their prison.

Isaiah,42,20,"Israel, you have seen much, but you have not obeyed. You have heard, but you refuse to listen.”"
Isaiah,42,21,The Lord made his teachings wonderful. He did this because he is good.
Isaiah,42,22,"These people have been defeated and robbed. They are trapped in pits. They are locked up in prison. Like robbers, enemies have taken them away. There is no one to save them. Enemies carried them off. And no one said, “Bring them back.”"
Isaiah,42,23,Will any of you listen to this? Will you listen carefully in the future?
Isaiah,42,24,Who let the people of Jacob be carried off? Who let robbers take Israel away? The Lord allowed this to happen because we sinned against him. We did not live the way the Lord wanted us to live. We did not obey his teaching.
Isaiah,42,25,So the Lord became very angry with us. He brought terrible wars against us. It was as if the people of Israel had fire all around them. But they didn’t know what was happening. It was as if they were burning. But they didn’t pay any attention.

Isaiah,43,6,I will tell the north: Give my people to me. I will tell the south: Don’t keep my people in prison. Bring my sons from far away. Bring my daughters from faraway places.
Isaiah,43,7,Bring to me all the people who are mine. I made them for my glory. I formed them; I made them.”

Isaiah,43,9,"All the nations should gather together. All the people should come together. Which of their gods said that this would happen? Which of their gods can tell what happened in the beginning? They should bring their witnesses to prove they were right. Then others will say, “It is true.”"
Isaiah,43,10,"The Lord says, “You are my witnesses. You are the servant I chose. I chose you so you would know and believe me. I chose you so you would understand that I am the true God. There was no God before me, and there will be no God after me."

Isaiah,43,17,"He is the one who defeated the chariots and horses. He defeated the mighty armies. They fell together, and they will never rise again. They were destroyed as a flame is put out."
Isaiah,43,18,"The Lord says, “Forget what happened before. Do not think about the past."
Isaiah,43,19,Look at the new thing I am going to do. It is already happening. Don’t you see it? I will make a road in the desert. I will make rivers in the dry land.
Isaiah,43,20,"Even the wild animals will be thankful to me. The wild dogs and owls will honor me. They will honor me when I put water in the desert. They will honor me when I make rivers in the dry land. I will do this to give water to my people, the ones I chose."
Isaiah,43,21,These are the people I made. And they will sing songs to praise me.
Isaiah,43,22,"“People of Jacob, you have not called to me. People of Israel, you have become tired of me."
Isaiah,43,23,You have not brought your sacrifices of sheep to me. You have not honored me by bringing sacrifices to me. I did not force you to give sacrifices to me. I did not force you to burn incense until you became tired.
Isaiah,43,24,So you did not buy incense for me. You did not freely bring fat from your sacrifices to me. Instead you have weighed me down with your many sins. You have made me tired of your many wrongs.
Isaiah,43,25,"“I, I am the One who forgives all your sins. I do this to please myself. I will not remember your sins."
Isaiah,43,26,But you should remind me. Let’s meet and decide what is right. Tell what you have done and show you are right.
Isaiah,43,27,Your first father sinned. And your leaders have turned against me.
Isaiah,43,28,So I will make your holy rulers not holy. And I will bring destruction on the people of Jacob. And I will let Israel be insulted.”
Isaiah,44,1,"The Lord says, “People of Jacob, you are my servants. Listen to me! People of Israel, I chose you.”"
Isaiah,44,2,"This is what the Lord says. He made you. He formed you when you were in your mother’s body. And he will help you. The Lord says, “People of Jacob, my servants, don’t be afraid. Israel, I chose you."
Isaiah,44,3,I will pour out water for the thirsty land. I will make streams flow on dry land. I will put my Spirit into your children. My blessing will be like a stream of water flowing over your family.
Isaiah,44,4,Your children will grow like a tree in the grass. They will be like poplar trees growing beside streams of water.
Isaiah,44,5,"One person will say, ‘I belong to the Lord.’ Another will use the name Jacob. Another will sign his name ‘I am the Lord’s.’ And another will use the name Israel.”"
Isaiah,44,6,"The Lord is the king of Israel. The Lord of heaven’s armies saves Israel. The Lord says, “I am the beginning and the end. I am the only God."

Isaiah,44,8,Don’t be afraid! Don’t worry! I have always told you what will happen. You are my witnesses. There is no other God. I know of no other Rock. I am the only One.”
Isaiah,44,9,"Some people make idols, but they are worth nothing. People love them, but they are useless. Those people are witnesses for the statues. But those people cannot see. They know nothing. They don’t know enough to be ashamed."
Isaiah,44,10,Who made these false gods? Who made these useless idols?
Isaiah,44,11,"The workmen who made those gods will be ashamed! Those workmen are only human. If they all would come together, they would all be ashamed and afraid."
Isaiah,44,12,"One workman uses tools to heat iron. He works over hot coals. He uses his hammer to beat the metal and make a statue. He uses his powerful arms. But when he becomes hungry, he loses his power. If he does not drink water, he becomes tired."
Isaiah,44,13,"Another workman uses a line and a compass to draw lines on the wood. Then he uses his chisels to cut a statue from wood. He uses his calipers to measure the statue. This way, the workman makes the wood look exactly like a man. And this statue of a man sits in the house."
Isaiah,44,14,"A man cuts down cedar or gets cypress or oak trees. Those trees grew by their own power in the forest. Or he plants a pine tree, and the rain makes it grow."
Isaiah,44,15,Then he burns the tree. He uses some of the wood for a fire to keep himself warm. He also starts a fire to bake his bread. But he uses part of the wood to make a god. Then he worships it! He makes the idol and bows down to it!
Isaiah,44,16,"The man burns half of the wood in the fire. He uses the fire to cook his meat. And he eats the meat until he is full. He burns the wood to keep himself warm. He says, “Good! Now I am warm. I can see because of the fire’s light.”"
Isaiah,44,17,"But the man makes a statue from the wood that is left. He calls it his god. He bows down to it and worships it. He prays to it and says, “You are my god. Save me!”"
Isaiah,44,18,Those people don’t know what they are doing. They don’t understand! It is as if their eyes are covered so they can’t see. Their minds don’t understand.
Isaiah,44,19,"They have not thought about these things. They don’t understand. They have never thought to themselves, “I burned half of the wood in the fire. I used the hot coals to bake my bread. I cooked and ate my meat. And I used the wood that was left to make this hated thing. I am worshiping a block of wood!”"
Isaiah,44,20,"He doesn’t know what he is doing. His confused mind leads him the wrong way. He cannot save himself. He cannot say, “This statue I am holding is a false god.”"
Isaiah,44,21,"The Lord says, “People of Jacob, remember these things! People of Israel, remember you are my servants. I made you. You are my servants. So Israel, I will not forget you."
Isaiah,44,22,I have swept away your sins like a big cloud. I have removed your sins like a cloud that disappears into the air. Come back to me because I saved you.”
Isaiah,44,23,"Skies, sing for joy because the Lord did great things! Earth, shout for joy, even in your deepest parts! Sing, you mountains, with thanks to God. Sing, too, you trees in the forest! The Lord saved the people of Jacob! The Lord showed his greatness when he saved Israel."
Isaiah,44,24,"The Lord saved you. He formed you while you were still in your mother’s body. The Lord says, “I, the Lord, made everything! I alone stretched out the skies. I spread out the earth by myself."
Isaiah,44,25,"I show that the lying prophets’ signs are false. I make fools of those who do magic. I confuse even wise men. They think they know much, but I make them look foolish."
Isaiah,44,26,"I make the messages of my servants come true. I make the advice of my messengers come true. I say to Jerusalem, ‘People will live in you again!’ I say to the towns of Judah, ‘You will be built again!’ I say to Jerusalem’s ruins, ‘I will repair you.’"
Isaiah,44,27,"I tell the deep waters, ‘Become dry! I will make your streams become dry!’"
Isaiah,44,28,"I say of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd. He will do all that I want him to do. He will say to Jerusalem, “You will be built again!” He will tell the Temple, “Your foundations will be rebuilt.”’”"
Isaiah,45,1,"This is what the Lord says to Cyrus, his appointed king: “I hold your right hand. I will help you defeat nations. I will help you take other kings’ power away. I will open doors for you so city gates will not stop you."
Isaiah,45,2,I will go before you. And I will make the mountains flat. I will break down the bronze gates of the cities. I will cut through the iron bars on the gates.

Isaiah,54,13,All your children will be taught by the Lord. And they will have much peace.
Isaiah,54,14,I will build you using fairness. You will be safe from those who would hurt you. So you will have nothing to fear. Nothing will come to make you afraid.

Isaiah,54,16,"“See, I made the blacksmith. He fans the fire to make it hotter. And he makes the kind of tool he wants. In the same way I have made the destroyer to destroy."
Isaiah,54,17,"So no weapon that is used against you will defeat you. You will show that those who speak against you are wrong. These are the good things my servants receive. Their victory comes from me,” says the Lord."
Isaiah,55,1,"The Lord says, “All you who are thirsty, come and drink. Those of you who do not have money, come, buy and eat! Come buy wine and milk. You don’t need money; it will cost you nothing."
Isaiah,55,2,"Why spend your money on something that is not real food? Why work for something that doesn’t really satisfy you? Listen closely to me, and you will eat what is good. You will enjoy the food that satisfies your soul."
Isaiah,55,3,Come to me and listen. Listen to me so you may live. I will make an agreement with you that will last forever. I will give you the blessings I promised to David.
Isaiah,55,4,I made David a witness of my power for all nations. I made him a ruler and commander of many nations.
Isaiah,55,5,You will call for nations that you don’t yet know. And these nations will run to you. This will happen because of the Lord your God. The Holy One of Israel honors you.”

Isaiah,55,8,"The Lord says, “Your thoughts are not like my thoughts. Your ways are not like my ways."
Isaiah,55,9,"Just as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways. And my thoughts are higher than your thoughts."
Isaiah,55,10,Rain and snow fall from the sky. They don’t return without watering the ground. They cause the plants to sprout and grow. And the plants make seeds for the farmer. And from these seeds people have bread to eat.
Isaiah,55,11,The words I say do the same thing. They will not return to me empty. They make the things happen that I want to happen. They succeed in doing what I send them to do.
Isaiah,55,12,“So you will go out with joy. You will be led out in peace. The mountains and hills will burst into song before you. All the trees in the fields will clap their hands.
Isaiah,55,13,Large cypress trees will grow where thornbushes were. Myrtle trees will grow where weeds were. These things will be a reminder of the Lord’s promise. And this reminder will never be destroyed.”

Isaiah,56,4,This is what the Lord says: “The eunuchs should obey the law about the Sabbath. They should do what I want. They should keep my agreement.
Isaiah,56,5,"If they do, I will make their names remembered within my Temple and its walls. It will be better for them than children. I will give them a name that will last forever. It will never be forgotten."
Isaiah,56,6,Foreigners will join the Lord to serve him. They will worship and love him. They will worship him. They will obey the law about the Sabbath. They will keep the agreement with the Lord.

Isaiah,56,9,"All you animals of the field, come to eat. All you animals of the forest, come to eat."
Isaiah,56,10,The leaders who are to guard the people are blind. They don’t know what they are doing. All of them are like quiet dogs. They don’t know how to bark. They lie down and dream. They love to sleep.
Isaiah,56,11,They are like hungry dogs. They are never satisfied. They are like shepherds who don’t know what they are doing. They each have gone their own way. All they want to do is satisfy themselves.
Isaiah,56,12,"They say, “Come, let’s drink some wine. Let’s drink all the beer we want. And tomorrow we will do this again. Or, maybe we will have even a better time.”"
Isaiah,57,1,"Those right with God may die, but no one pays attention. Good people are taken away, but no one understands. The people who do right are being taken away because of evil."

Isaiah,57,3,"“Come here, you magicians! Come here, you sons of prostitutes and those who take part in adultery!"
Isaiah,57,4,"Whom are you making fun of? Whom are you insulting? At whom do you stick out your tongue? You turn against God, and you are liars."
Isaiah,57,5,You sin sexually under every green tree to worship your false gods. You kill children in the ravines and sacrifice them in the rocky places.
Isaiah,57,6,You take the smooth rocks from the ravines. They are your portion. You pour drink offerings on them to worship them. You give grain offerings to them. Do you think this makes me want to forgive you?
Isaiah,57,7,You make your bed on every hill and mountain. And there you offer sacrifices.
Isaiah,57,8,"You have hidden your idols behind your doors and doorposts. You have left me, and you have uncovered yourself. You have pulled back the covers and climbed into bed. You have made an agreement with the ones whose beds you love. And you have looked at their nakedness."
Isaiah,57,9,You use your oils and perfumes to look nice for Molech. You have sent your messengers to faraway lands. You even tried to send them to where the dead are.
Isaiah,57,10,You have worked hard to do these things. But you never gave up. You found new strength. So you did not quit.
Isaiah,57,11,“Whom were you so afraid of that you lied to me? You have not remembered me or even thought about me. I have been quiet for a long time. Is that why you are not afraid of me?
Isaiah,57,12,I will tell about your ‘goodness’ and what you do. And those things will do you no good.
Isaiah,57,13,"When you cry out for help, let the false gods you have gathered help you. The wind will blow them all away. Just a puff of wind will take them away. But the person who depends on me will receive the land. He will have my holy mountain.”"
Isaiah,57,14,"The Lord says, “Build a road! Build a road! Prepare the way! Make the way clear for my people.”"
Isaiah,57,15,"God lives forever and is holy. He is high and lifted up, and he says, “I live in a high and holy place. But I also live with people who are sad and humble. I give new life to those who are humble. I give new life to those whose hearts are broken."

Isaiah,57,19,"I will give peace, real peace, to those far and near. And I will heal them,” says the Lord."
Isaiah,57,20,But evil people are like the angry sea. It cannot rest. Its waves toss up waste and mud.
Isaiah,57,21,"“There is no peace for evil people,” says my God."
Isaiah,58,1,"The Lord says, “Shout out loud. Don’t hold back. Shout out loud like a trumpet. Tell the people about the things they have done against God. Tell the family of Jacob about their sins."
Isaiah,58,2,Then they will come every day looking for me. And they will want to learn my ways. They will become a nation that does what is right. They will obey the commands of their God. They will ask me to judge them fairly. They will want God to be near them.
Isaiah,58,3,"They say, ‘To honor you we had special days when we gave up eating. But you didn’t see. We humbled ourselves to honor you. But you didn’t notice.’” But the Lord says, “You do what pleases yourselves on these special days. And you are unfair to your workers."
Isaiah,58,4,"On these special days when you do not eat, you argue and fight. You hit each other with your fists. You cannot do these things as you do now and believe I will listen to your prayers."
Isaiah,58,5,This kind of special day is not what I want. This is not the way I want people to be sorry for what they have done. I don’t want people just to bow their heads like a plant. I don’t want them to wear rough cloth and lie in ashes to show their sadness. This is what you do on your special days when you do not eat. But do you think this is what the Lord wants?
Isaiah,58,6,“I will tell you the kind of special day I want. I want you to free the people you have put in prison unfairly. Undo their chains. Free those to whom you are unfair. Free them from their hard labor.
Isaiah,58,7,"I want you to share your food with hungry people. I want you to bring poor, homeless people into your own homes. When you see someone who has no clothes, give him yours. Don’t refuse to help your own relatives."
Isaiah,58,8,"If you do these things, your light will shine like the dawn. Then your wounds will quickly heal. Your God will walk before you, and the glory of the Lord will protect you from behind."
Isaiah,58,9,"Then you will call to the Lord, and the Lord will answer you. You will cry out to the Lord, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’ “You should stop making trouble for others. You should stop using cruel words and pointing your finger at others."
Isaiah,58,10,You should feed those who are hungry. You should take care of the needs of those who are troubled. Then your light will shine in the darkness. And you will be bright like sunshine at noon.
Isaiah,58,11,The Lord will always lead you. He will satisfy your needs in dry lands. He will give strength to your bones. You will be like a garden that has much water. You will be like a spring that never runs dry.
Isaiah,58,12,Your people will rebuild the old cities that are now in ruins. You will rebuild the foundations of these ancient cities. You will be known for repairing the broken places. You will be known for rebuilding the roads and houses.
Isaiah,58,13,“You must obey God’s law about the Sabbath. You must not do what pleases yourselves on that holy day. You should call the Sabbath a joyful day. You should honor the Lord’s holy day. You should honor it by not doing whatever you please on that day. You should not say whatever you please on that day.
Isaiah,58,14,"Then you will find joy in the Lord. And I, the Lord, will carry you to the high places above the earth. I will let you eat the crops of the land your ancestor Jacob had.” The Lord has said these things."
Isaiah,59,1,Surely the Lord’s power is enough to save you. He can hear you when you ask him for help.
Isaiah,59,2,It is your evil that has separated you from your God. Your sins cause him to turn away from you. And then he does not hear you.
Isaiah,59,3,With your hands you have killed others. Your fingers are covered with blood from killing people. With your lips you have lied. With your tongue you say evil things.
Isaiah,59,4,People take each other to court unfairly. No one tells the truth in arguing his case. They accuse each other falsely and tell lies. They cause trouble and create more evil.
Isaiah,59,5,"They hatch evil like eggs from poisonous snakes. If you eat one of those eggs, you will die. And if you break one open, a poisonous snake comes out. People tell lies as they would spin a spider’s web."
Isaiah,59,6,The webs they make cannot be used for clothes. You can’t cover yourself with those webs. The things they do are evil. They use their hands to hurt others.
Isaiah,59,7,They eagerly run to do evil. They are always ready to kill innocent people. They think evil thoughts. Everywhere they go they cause ruin and destruction.
Isaiah,59,8,They don’t know how to live in peace. There is no fairness in their lives. They are dishonest. Anyone who lives as they live will never have peace.
Isaiah,59,9,"Fairness has gone far away. Goodness is nowhere to be found. We wait for the light, but there is only darkness now. We hope for a bright light, but all we have is darkness."
Isaiah,59,10,We are like blind people feeling our way along a wall. We have to feel our way as if we had no eyes. In the brightness of day we trip as if it were night. We are like dead men among the strong.
Isaiah,59,11,"All of us growl like the bears. We call out sadly like the doves. We look for justice, but there isn’t any. We want to be saved, but salvation is far away."
Isaiah,59,12,We have done many wrong things against our God. Our sins show we are wrong. We know we have turned against God. We know the evil things we have done.
Isaiah,59,13,We have sinned and turned against the Lord. We have turned away from our God. We have planned to hurt others and to disobey God. We have planned and spoken lies.
Isaiah,59,14,We have driven away justice. We have kept away from what is right. Truth is not spoken in the streets. What is honest is not allowed to enter the city.
Isaiah,59,15,Truth cannot be found anywhere. And people who refuse to do evil are attacked. The Lord looked and could not find any justice. And he was displeased.
Isaiah,59,16,He could not find anyone to help the people. He was surprised that there was no one to help. So the Lord used his own power to save the people. His own goodness gave him strength.
Isaiah,59,17,The Lord covered himself with goodness like armor. He put on the helmet of salvation. He put on the clothes of punishment. And he put on the coat of his strong love.
Isaiah,59,18,The Lord will pay back his enemies for what they have done. He will show his anger to those who were against him. He will punish the people in faraway places. He will give them the punishment they should have.
Isaiah,59,19,"Then people from the west will fear the Lord. People in the east will fear his glory. The Lord will come quickly like a fast-flowing river, driven by the breath of the Lord."

This will happen to honor the Lord your God. He is the Holy One of Israel. And he does wonderful things for you.
Isaiah,60,10,"“Jerusalem, foreigners will rebuild your walls. Their kings will serve you. When I was angry, I hurt you. But now I want to be kind to you and comfort you."

Isaiah,60,14,"The people who have hurt you will bow down to you. Those who hated you will bow down at your feet. They will call you The City of the Lord. They will call you Jerusalem, city of the Holy One of Israel."
Isaiah,60,15,“You have been hated and left empty. No one has even passed through. But I will make you great from now on. You will be a place of happiness forever and ever.

Isaiah,63,10,But they turned against the Lord. They made his Holy Spirit very sad. So the Lord became their enemy. And he fought against them.
Isaiah,63,11,But then his people remembered what happened long ago. They remembered Moses. Where is the Lord who brought the people through the sea? Where is the one who brought them with the leaders of his people? Where is the one who put his Holy Spirit among them?

Isaiah,65,2,All day long I stood ready to accept people who turned against me. But the way they continue to live is not good. They do anything they want to do.
Isaiah,65,3,Right in front of me they continue to do things that make me angry. They offer sacrifices to their false gods in their gardens. They burn incense on altars of brick.
Isaiah,65,4,They sit among the graves. They spend their nights waiting to get messages from the dead. They eat the meat of pigs. Their pots are full of soup made from meat that is wrong to eat.
