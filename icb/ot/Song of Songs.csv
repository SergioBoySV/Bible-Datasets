Song of Songs,1,2,Kiss me with the kisses of your mouth! Your love is better than wine.
Song of Songs,1,3,The smell of your perfume is pleasant. Your name is pleasant like expensive perfume! That’s why the young women love you.
Song of Songs,1,4,"Take me with you; let’s run. The king takes me into his rooms. We will rejoice and be happy with you. We praise your love more than wine. With good reason, the young women love you, my lover."
Song of Songs,1,5,"I’m dark but lovely, women of Jerusalem. I’m dark like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon."
Song of Songs,1,6,"Don’t look at how dark I am, at how dark the sun has made me. My brothers were angry with me. They made me tend the vineyards. So I haven’t tended my own vineyard!"
Song of Songs,1,7,"Tell me, you whom I love, where do you feed your sheep? Where do you make them rest at noon? Why should I look for you near your friend’s sheep? Am I like a woman who wears a veil?"

Song of Songs,1,16,"You are so handsome, my lover. You are so pleasant! Our bed is the grass."
Song of Songs,1,17,The boards of our house are cedar trees. And the wood of our ceiling is juniper trees.
Song of Songs,2,1,I am a rose in the Plain of Sharon. I am a lily in the valleys.
Song of Songs,2,2,"Among the young women, my darling is like a lily among thorns!"
Song of Songs,2,3,"Among young men, my lover is like an apple tree among the trees in the woods! I enjoy sitting in his shadow. His fruit is sweet to my taste."

Song of Songs,2,14,"My beloved is like a dove that hides in the cracks of the rock. She hides in the secret places of the cliff. Show me your face. Let me hear your voice. Your voice is very sweet, and your face is lovely."
Song of Songs,2,15,Catch the foxes for us— the little foxes that ruin the vineyards. Our vineyards are in blossom.
Song of Songs,2,16,"My lover is mine, and I am his. He feeds among the lilies"
Song of Songs,2,17,"until the day dawns and the shadows disappear. Turn, my lover. Be like a gazelle or a young deer on the rugged mountains."
Song of Songs,3,1,"At night on my bed, I looked for the one I love. I looked for him, but I could not find him."
Song of Songs,3,2,"I will get up now. I will go around the city, in the streets and squares. I will look for the one I love. I looked for him, but I could not find him."
Song of Songs,3,3,"The watchmen found me as they patrolled the city. I asked, “Have you seen the one I love?”"
Song of Songs,3,4,As soon as I had left them I found the one I love. I held him. I would not let him go until I had brought him to my mother’s house. I brought him into the room where I was born.

Song of Songs,3,8,These soldiers all carry swords. They have been trained in war. Every man wears his sword at his side. He is ready for the dangers of the night.
Song of Songs,3,9,King Solomon had a couch made for himself. It is made of wood from Lebanon.
Song of Songs,3,10,He made its posts of silver and its braces of gold. The seat was covered with purple cloth. The women of Jerusalem wove it with love.
Song of Songs,3,11,"Women of Jerusalem, go out and see King Solomon. He is wearing the crown his mother put on his head. It was his wedding day, when his heart was happy!"
Song of Songs,4,1,"How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, you are beautiful! Your eyes behind your veil are like doves. Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down Mount Gilead."
Song of Songs,4,2,Your teeth are white like newly-sheared sheep just coming from their bath. Each one has a twin. None of them is alone.
Song of Songs,4,3,Your lips are like red silk thread. Your mouth is lovely. Your cheeks behind your veil are like slices of a pomegranate.
Song of Songs,4,4,Your neck looks like David’s tower. The tower was built with rows of stones. A thousand shields hang on its walls. Each shield belongs to a strong soldier.

Song of Songs,4,12,"My sister, my bride, you are like a garden locked up. You are like a spring with a wall around it, a fountain that is closed."
Song of Songs,4,13,Your limbs are like an orchard of pomegranates and all the best fruit. It is filled with flowers and nard.
Song of Songs,4,14,"It also has saffron, calamus and cinnamon. It is filled with trees of incense, myrrh and aloes— all the best spices."
Song of Songs,4,15,You are like a garden fountain— a well of fresh water flowing down from the mountains of Lebanon.
Song of Songs,4,16,"Awake, north wind! Come, you south wind! Blow on my garden. Let its sweet smells flow out. Let my lover enter the garden. And let him eat its best fruits."
Song of Songs,5,1,"I have entered my garden, my sister, my bride. I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey. I have drunk my wine and my milk. Eat, friends, and drink. Yes, drink deeply, lovers."
Song of Songs,5,2,"I sleep, but my heart is awake. I hear my lover knocking. “Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my perfect one. My head is wet with dew. And my hair is wet with the dampness of the night.”"
Song of Songs,5,3,I have taken off my garment. I don’t want to put it on again! I have washed my feet. I don’t want to get them dirty again!
Song of Songs,5,4,My lover put his hand through the door opening. I felt excited inside.
Song of Songs,5,5,"I got up to open the door for my lover. Myrrh was dripping from my hands. Myrrh was flowing from my fingers, onto the handles of the lock."
Song of Songs,5,6,"I opened the door for my lover. But my lover had left. He was gone. When he had spoken, he had taken my breath away. I looked for him, but I could not find him. I called for him, but he did not answer me."
Song of Songs,5,7,The watchmen found me as they patrolled the city. They hit me; they hurt me. The guards on the wall took away my coat.

Song of Songs,6,13,"Come back, come back, woman of Shulam. Come back, come back, so we may look at you! Why do you want to look at the woman of Shulam as you would at the dance of two groups?"
Song of Songs,7,1,"Your feet are beautiful in sandals, you daughter of a prince. Your round thighs are like jewels shaped by an artist."
Song of Songs,7,2,Your navel is like a round drinking cup always filled with wine. Your stomach is like a pile of wheat with lilies around it like a fence.
Song of Songs,7,3,Your breasts are like two fawns. They are like twins of a gazelle.
Song of Songs,7,4,Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon near the gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.
Song of Songs,7,5,Your head is like Mount Carmel. And your hair is like purple cloth. The king is captured in its folds.

Song of Songs,7,10,"I belong to my lover, and he desires only me."
Song of Songs,7,11,"Come, my lover. Let’s go out into the country. Let’s spend the night in the fields."
Song of Songs,7,12,Let’s go early to the vineyards. Let’s see if the buds are on the vines. Let’s see if the blossoms have already opened and if the pomegranates have bloomed. There I will give you my love.
Song of Songs,7,13,"The mandrake flowers give their sweet smell. And at our gates there are all the best fruits. I have saved them for you, my lover, the old delights and the new."
Song of Songs,8,1,"I wish you were like my brother who was fed at my mother’s breasts! If I found you outside, I would kiss you. And no one would look down on me."
