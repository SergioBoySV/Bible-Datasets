1 Chronicles,21,3,"But Joab answered, “May the Lord make the nation 100 times as large. My master the king, all the Israelites are your servants. Why do you want to do this, my master? You will make Israel guilty of sin.”"
1 Chronicles,21,4,"But King David made Joab follow his order. So Joab left and went through all Israel, counting the people. Then he returned to Jerusalem."
1 Chronicles,21,5,"He told David how many people there were. In Israel there were 1,100,000 men who could use a sword. And there were 470,000 men in Judah who could use a sword."
1 Chronicles,21,6,But Joab did not count the tribes of Levi and Benjamin. He didn’t count them because he didn’t like King David’s order.
1 Chronicles,21,7,David had done something God had said was wrong. So God punished Israel.
1 Chronicles,21,8,"Then David said to God, “I have done something very foolish. It was a terrible sin. Now, I beg you to forgive me, your servant.”"
1 Chronicles,21,9,"Gad was David’s seer. The Lord said to Gad,"
1 Chronicles,21,10,"“Go and tell David: ‘This is what the Lord says: I am going to give you three choices. Choose one, and I will punish you in that way.’”"
1 Chronicles,21,11,"So Gad went to David and said to him, “This is what the Lord says: ‘Choose which punishment you want."
1 Chronicles,21,12,"You may choose three years without enough food for the nation. Or choose three months of running from your enemies as they chase you with their swords. Or choose three days of punishment from the Lord. A terrible disease will spread through the country. The angel of the Lord will go through Israel destroying the people.’ Now, David, decide which answer I will give to the Lord, who sent me.”"
1 Chronicles,21,13,"David said to Gad, “I am in trouble. I don’t want some man to punish me. The Lord is very merciful. So let the Lord punish me.”"
1 Chronicles,21,14,"So the Lord sent a terrible disease on Israel, and 70,000 people died."
1 Chronicles,21,15,"God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But when the angel started to destroy it, the Lord saw it and felt sorry. So he said to the angel who was destroying, “That is enough! Stop!” The angel of the Lord was then standing at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
1 Chronicles,21,16,David looked up and saw the angel of the Lord in the sky. The angel was holding his sword over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders bowed facedown on the ground. They were wearing rough cloth to show their sadness.
1 Chronicles,21,17,"David said to God, “I am the one who sinned. I gave the order for the people to be counted. I have done wrong. These people are only sheep. What wrong have they done? Lord my God, punish me and my family. But stop the terrible disease that is killing your people.”"
1 Chronicles,21,18,Then the angel of the Lord gave an order to Gad. He told Gad to tell David to build an altar to worship the Lord. It was to be at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles,21,19,Gad told David these things from the Lord. So David went to Araunah’s threshing floor.
1 Chronicles,21,20,"Araunah was separating the straw from the wheat. When he turned around, he saw the angel. Araunah’s four sons who were with him hid."
1 Chronicles,21,21,"David went to Araunah. When Araunah saw David, he left the threshing floor. He bowed facedown on the ground before David."
1 Chronicles,21,22,"David said to him, “Sell me your threshing floor. Then I can build an altar to worship the Lord here. Then the terrible disease will be stopped. Sell it to me for the full price.”"
1 Chronicles,21,23,"Araunah said to David, “Take this threshing floor. You are my master the king. Do anything you want. Look, I will also give you oxen for the burnt offering. I will give you boards as wood for the fire. And I will give the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this to you.”"
1 Chronicles,21,24,"But King David answered Araunah, “No, I must pay the full price. I won’t take anything that is yours and give it to the Lord. I won’t give an offering that costs me nothing.”"
1 Chronicles,21,25,So David paid Araunah about 15 pounds of gold for the place.
1 Chronicles,21,26,David built an altar to worship the Lord there. He offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. David prayed to the Lord. And the Lord answered him by sending down fire from heaven. It came down on the altar of burnt offering.
1 Chronicles,21,27,Then the Lord commanded the angel to put his sword back into its holder.
1 Chronicles,21,28,David saw that the Lord had answered him on the threshing floor of Araunah. So he offered sacrifices to the Lord there.
1 Chronicles,21,29,The Holy Tent and the altar of burnt offerings were in Gibeon. They were at the place of worship there. Moses had made the Holy Tent while the Israelites were in the desert.
1 Chronicles,21,30,But David could not go to the Holy Tent to speak with God. He was afraid of the angel of the Lord and his sword.
1 Chronicles,22,1,"David said, “The Temple of the Lord God will be built here. And the altar for burnt offerings for Israel will be built here.”"
1 Chronicles,22,2,So David gave an order for all foreigners living in Israel to be gathered together. From that group David chose stonecutters. Their job was to cut stones to be used in building the Temple of God.
1 Chronicles,22,3,David supplied a large amount of iron. It was used for making nails and hinges for the gate doors. He also supplied more bronze than could be weighed.
1 Chronicles,22,4,And he supplied more cedar logs than could be counted. Much of the cedar had been brought to David by the people from Sidon and Tyre.
1 Chronicles,22,5,"David said, “We should build a great Temple for the Lord. It should be famous everywhere for its greatness and beauty. But my son Solomon is young. He hasn’t yet learned what he needs to know. So I will prepare for the building of it.” So David got many of the materials ready before he died."
1 Chronicles,22,6,"Then David called for his son Solomon. He told Solomon to build the Temple for the Lord, the God of Israel."
1 Chronicles,22,7,"David said to him, “My son, I wanted to build a temple for worshiping the Lord my God."
1 Chronicles,22,8,"But the Lord spoke his word to me, ‘David, you have killed too many people. You have fought too many wars. So you cannot build a temple for worship to me. You have killed too many people."
1 Chronicles,22,9,"But, you will have a son. He will be a man of peace and rest. I will give him rest from all his enemies around him. His name will be Solomon. And I will give Israel peace and quiet while he is king."
1 Chronicles,22,10,"Solomon will build a temple for worship to me. He will be my son, and I will be his father. I will make his kingdom strong. Someone from his family will rule Israel forever.’”"
1 Chronicles,22,11,"David also said, “Now, my son, may the Lord be with you. May you build a temple for the Lord your God, as he said you would."
1 Chronicles,22,12,The Lord will make you the king of Israel. May the Lord give you wisdom and understanding. Then you will be able to obey the teachings of the Lord your God.
1 Chronicles,22,13,"Be careful to obey the rules and laws the Lord gave Moses for Israel. If you obey them, you will have success. Be strong and brave. Don’t be afraid or discouraged."
1 Chronicles,22,14,"“Solomon, I have worked hard getting many of the materials for building the Temple of the Lord. I have supplied about seven and a half million pounds of gold. And I have supplied about seventy-five million pounds of silver. I have supplied so much bronze and iron it cannot be weighed. And I have supplied wood and stone. And you may add to them."
1 Chronicles,22,15,"You have many workmen. You have stonecutters, stoneworkers and carpenters. You have men skilled in every kind of work."
1 Chronicles,22,16,"They are skilled in working with gold, silver, bronze and iron. You have more craftsmen than can be counted. Now begin the work. And may the Lord be with you.”"
1 Chronicles,22,17,Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon.
1 Chronicles,22,18,"David said to them, “The Lord your God is with you. He has given you rest from our enemies. He helped me to defeat the people living around us. The Lord and his people are in control of this land."
1 Chronicles,22,19,Now give yourself completely to obeying the Lord your God. Build the holy place of the Lord God. Build the Temple for worship to the Lord. Then bring the Ark of the Covenant with the Lord into the Temple. And bring in the holy things that belong to God.”
1 Chronicles,23,1,David had lived long and was old. Then he made his son Solomon the new king of Israel.
1 Chronicles,23,2,"David gathered all the leaders of Israel, along with the priests and Levites."
1 Chronicles,23,3,"David counted the Levites who were 30 years old and older. In all, there were 38,000 Levites."
