2 Kings,1,1,"After Ahab died, Moab broke away from Israel’s rule."
2 Kings,1,2,"Ahaziah fell down through the wooden bars in his upstairs room in Samaria. He was badly hurt. He sent messengers and told them, “Go. Ask Baal-Zebub god of Ekron if I will get well from my injuries.”"
2 Kings,1,3,"But the Lord’s angel said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Get up. Go meet the messengers sent by the king of Samaria. Say to them, ‘Why are you going to ask questions of Baal-Zebub god of Ekron? Is it because you think there is no God in Israel?’"
2 Kings,1,4,So this is what the Lord says: ‘You will not get up from the bed you are lying on. You will die.’” Then Elijah left.
2 Kings,1,5,"The messengers came back to Ahaziah. He asked them, “Why have you come back?”"
2 Kings,1,6,"They said, “A man came to meet us. He said, ‘Go back to the king who sent you. Tell him what the Lord says: “Why do you send men to ask questions of Baal-Zebub god of Ekron? Is it because you think there is no God in Israel? This is why you will not get up from your bed. You will die.”’”"
2 Kings,1,7,"Ahaziah asked them, “What did the man look like who met you and told you this?”"
2 Kings,1,8,"They answered, “He wore a hairy coat and a leather belt around his waist.” Ahaziah said, “It was Elijah the Tishbite.”"
2 Kings,1,9,"Then he sent a captain with his 50 men to Elijah. The captain went to Elijah, who was sitting on top of the hill. He said to Elijah, “Man of God, the king says, ‘Come down!’”"
2 Kings,1,10,"Elijah answered the captain, “I am a man of God. So let fire come down from heaven and burn up you and your 50 men.” Then fire came down from heaven. It burned up the captain and his 50 men."
2 Kings,1,11,"Ahaziah sent another captain and 50 men to Elijah. The captain said to him, “Man of God, this is what the king says: ‘Come down quickly!’”"
2 Kings,1,12,"Elijah answered, “I am a man of God. So let fire come down from heaven and burn up you and your 50 men!” Then fire came down from heaven. It burned up the captain and his 50 men."
2 Kings,1,13,"Ahaziah sent a third captain with his 50 men. The third captain came and fell down on his knees before Elijah. He begged Elijah, “Man of God, I ask you. Please let my life and the lives of your 50 servants be valuable to you!"
2 Kings,1,14,"See, fire came down from heaven. It burned up the first two captains of 50 with all their men. But now, let my life be valuable to you.”"
2 Kings,1,15,"The Lord’s angel said to Elijah, “Go with him. Don’t be afraid of him.” So Elijah got up and went with him to see the king."
2 Kings,1,16,"Elijah told Ahaziah, “This is what the Lord says: ‘You have sent messengers to ask questions of Baal-Zebub god of Ekron. Is it because you think there is no God in Israel to ask? Because of this, you will not get up from your bed. You will die.’”"
2 Kings,1,17,"So he died, just as the Lord, through Elijah, had said he would. Joram became king in Ahaziah’s place. This was during the second year Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat was king of Judah. Joram ruled because Ahaziah had no son to take his place."
2 Kings,1,18,The other things Ahaziah did are written down. They are in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,2,1,It was near the time for the Lord to take Elijah. He was going to take him by a whirlwind up into heaven. Elijah and Elisha were at Gilgal.
2 Kings,2,2,"Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here. The Lord has told me to go to Bethel.” But Elisha said, “As the Lord lives, and as you live, I won’t leave you.” So they went down to Bethel."
2 Kings,2,3,"A group of the prophets at Bethel came to Elisha. They said to him, “Do you know the Lord will take your master away from you today?” Elisha said, “Yes, I know. But don’t talk about it.”"
2 Kings,2,4,"Elijah said to him, “Stay here, because the Lord has sent me to Jericho.” But Elisha said, “As the Lord lives, and as you live, I won’t leave you.” So they went to Jericho."
2 Kings,2,5,"A group of the prophets at Jericho came to Elisha. They said, “Do you know that the Lord will take your master away from you today?” Elisha answered, “Yes, I know. But don’t talk about it.”"
2 Kings,2,6,"Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here. The Lord has sent me to the Jordan River.” Elisha answered, “As the Lord lives, and as you live, I won’t leave you.” So the two of them went on."
2 Kings,2,7,Fifty men from a group of the prophets came. They stood far from where Elijah and Elisha were by the Jordan.
2 Kings,2,8,Elijah took off his coat. Then he rolled it up and hit the water. The water divided to the right and to the left. Then Elijah and Elisha crossed over on dry ground.
2 Kings,2,9,"After they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “What can I do for you before I am taken from you?” Elisha said, “Leave me a double share of your spirit.”"
2 Kings,2,10,"Elijah said, “You have asked a hard thing. But if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours. If you don’t, it won’t happen.”"
2 Kings,2,11,Elijah and Elisha were still walking and talking. Then a chariot and horses of fire appeared. The chariot and horses of fire separated Elijah from Elisha. Then Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.
2 Kings,2,12,"Elisha saw it and shouted, “My father! My father! The chariots of Israel and their horsemen!” Elisha did not see him anymore. Elisha grabbed his own clothes and tore them to show how sad he was."
2 Kings,2,13,He picked up Elijah’s coat that had fallen from him. Then Elisha returned and stood on the bank of the Jordan.
2 Kings,2,14,"Elisha hit the water with Elijah’s coat. He said, “Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah?” When he hit the water, it divided to the right and to the left. Then Elisha crossed over."
2 Kings,2,15,"A group of the prophets at Jericho were watching. They said, “Elisha now has the spirit Elijah had.” They came to meet him. And they bowed down to the ground before him."
2 Kings,2,16,"They said to him, “There are 50 strong men with us! Please let them go and look for your master. Maybe the Spirit of the Lord has taken Elijah up and set him down. He may be on some mountain or in some valley.” But Elisha answered, “No. Don’t send them.”"
2 Kings,2,17,"The group of prophets begged Elisha until he hated to refuse them anymore. Then he said, “Send them.” So they sent 50 men who looked for three days. But they could not find Elijah."
2 Kings,2,18,"Then they came back to Elisha at Jericho where he was staying. He said to them, “I told you not to go, didn’t I?”"
2 Kings,2,19,"The men of the city said to Elisha, “Look, master, this city is a nice place to live. You can see that. But the water is bad. That’s why the land cannot grow crops.”"
2 Kings,2,20,"Elisha said, “Bring me a new bowl and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him."
2 Kings,2,21,"Then Elisha went out to the spring of water and threw the salt in it. He said, “This is what the Lord says: ‘I have healed this water. From now on it won’t cause death. And it won’t keep the land from growing crops.’”"
2 Kings,2,22,The water was healed. It is still good today. It happened just as Elisha had said.
2 Kings,2,23,"From there Elisha went up to Bethel. On the way some young men came out of the city. They made fun of Elisha. They said to him, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!”"
2 Kings,2,24,Elisha turned around and looked at them. He put a curse on them in the name of the Lord. Then two female bears came out of the woods. They tore to pieces 42 of the young men.
2 Kings,2,25,Then Elisha left and went on to Mount Carmel. From there he went back to Samaria.
2 Kings,3,1,Joram son of Ahab became king over Israel at Samaria. He began to rule in Jehoshaphat’s eighteenth year as king of Judah. Joram ruled 12 years.
2 Kings,3,2,Joram did what the Lord said was wrong. But he was not like his father and mother. He removed the stone pillars his father had made for Baal.
2 Kings,3,3,But he continued to do the same sins Jeroboam son of Nebat had done. Jeroboam had caused the people of Israel to sin. And Joram did not stop doing these same sins.
2 Kings,3,4,"Mesha king of Moab raised sheep. He had to give 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 male sheep to the king of Israel."
2 Kings,3,5,"But when Ahab died, the king of Moab turned against the king of Israel."
2 Kings,3,6,So King Joram went out from Samaria and gathered all Israel.
2 Kings,3,7,"He sent messengers to Jehoshaphat king of Judah. He said, “The king of Moab has turned against me. Will you go with me against Moab in battle?” Jehoshaphat said, “I will go with you. I am ready to join you. My soldiers and my horses are ready to join with your army.”"
2 Kings,3,8,"Jehoshaphat asked, “Which way should we go to attack?” Joram answered, “Through the Desert of Edom.”"
2 Kings,3,9,So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. They marched seven days. There was no more water for the army or for their animals that were with them.
2 Kings,3,10,"The king of Israel said, “How terrible this is! Has the Lord called us three kings together so the Moabites can defeat us?”"
2 Kings,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there a prophet of the Lord here? We can ask the Lord through a prophet.” An officer of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He was Elijah’s servant.”"
2 Kings,3,12,"Jehoshaphat said, “He speaks the Lord’s truth.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to see Elisha."
2 Kings,3,13,"Elisha spoke to the king of Israel. He said, “I have nothing to do with you! Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother!” The king of Israel said to Elisha, “No. The Lord has called us three kings together to let the Moabites defeat us.”"
2 Kings,3,14,"Elisha said, “I serve the Lord of heaven’s armies. As surely as he lives, I tell you the truth. I wouldn’t even look at you or notice you if Jehoshaphat king of Judah were not here. I respect him!"
2 Kings,3,15,"Now bring me someone who plays the harp.” While the harp was being played, the Lord gave Elisha power."
2 Kings,3,16,"Then Elisha said, “The Lord says to dig holes in the valley."
2 Kings,3,17,"He says that you won’t see wind or rain. But the valley will be filled with water. Then you, your cattle and other animals will drink."
2 Kings,3,18,This is easy for the Lord to do. He will also let you defeat Moab.
2 Kings,3,19,"You will destroy every strong, walled city and every important town. You will cut down every good tree. You will stop up all springs of water. You will ruin every good field with rocks.”"
2 Kings,3,20,"The next morning, about the time the sacrifice was offered, there was water! It came from the direction of Edom and filled the valley."
2 Kings,3,21,All the Moabites had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them. They gathered everyone old enough to put on armor. And they waited at the border.
2 Kings,3,22,"But when the Moabites got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water. They saw the water across from them. It looked as red as blood."
2 Kings,3,23,"The Moabites said, “This is blood! Surely the kings have fought and killed each other! Come, Moabites, let’s take what is valuable from the dead bodies!”"
2 Kings,3,24,The Moabites came to the camp of the Israelites. But the Israelites came out and fought them until they ran away. The Israelites went on into the land to fight the Moabites.
2 Kings,3,25,"They tore down the cities. They threw rocks on every good field and filled it. They stopped up all the springs of water. And they cut down all the good trees. Kir Hareseth was the only city with its stones still in place. But the men with slings surrounded Kir Hareseth and conquered it, too."
2 Kings,3,26,The king of Moab saw that the battle was too strong for him. So he took 700 men with swords to break through to the king of Edom. But they could not break through.
2 Kings,3,27,"Then the king of Moab took his oldest son, who would have become king after him. And he offered his son as a burnt offering on the wall. So there was great anger against the Israelites. They left and went back to their own land."
2 Kings,4,1,"The wife of a man from a group of the prophets came to Elisha. She said, “Your servant, my husband, is dead! You know he honored the Lord. But now the man he owes money to is coming to take my two boys. He will make them his slaves!”"
2 Kings,4,2,"Elisha answered, “How can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?” The woman said, “I don’t have anything there except a pot of oil.”"
2 Kings,4,3,"Then Elisha said, “Go and get empty jars from all your neighbors. Don’t ask for just a few."
2 Kings,4,4,Then you must go into your house and close the door. Only you and your sons will be there. Then pour oil into all the jars. Set the full ones to one side.”
2 Kings,4,5,"She left Elisha and shut the door. Only she and her sons were in the house. As they brought the jars to her, she poured the oil."
2 Kings,4,6,"When the jars were all full, she said to her son, “Bring me another jar.” But he said, “There are no more jars.” Then the oil stopped flowing."
2 Kings,4,7,"She went and told Elisha. Elisha said to her, “Go. Sell the oil and pay what you owe. You and your sons can live on what is left.”"
2 Kings,4,8,"One day Elisha went to Shunem. An important woman lived there. She begged Elisha to stay and eat. So every time Elisha passed by, he stopped there to eat."
2 Kings,4,9,"The woman said to her husband, “I know that Elisha is a holy man of God. He passes by our house all the time."
2 Kings,4,10,"Let’s make a small room on the roof. Let’s put a bed in the room for Elisha. And we can put a table, a chair and a lampstand there. Then when he comes by, he can stay there.”"
2 Kings,4,11,One day Elisha came to the woman’s house. He went to his room and rested.
2 Kings,4,12,"He said to his servant Gehazi, “Call the Shunammite.” When the servant called her, she stood in front of him."
2 Kings,4,13,"Elisha told his servant, “Now say to her, ‘You have gone to all this trouble for us. What can I do for you? Do you want me to speak to the king or the commander of the army for you?’ ” The woman answered, “I live among my own people.”"
2 Kings,4,14,"Elisha said, “But what can we do for her?” Gehazi answered, “She has no son, and her husband is old.”"
2 Kings,4,15,"Then Elisha said, “Call her.” So he called her, and she stood in the doorway."
2 Kings,4,16,"Then Elisha said, “About this time next year, you will hold a son in your arms.” The woman said, “No, master, man of God. Don’t lie to me!”"
2 Kings,4,17,But the woman became pregnant. And she gave birth to a son at that time the next year as Elisha had told her.
2 Kings,4,18,"The child grew. One day he went out to his father, who was with the men harvesting grain."
2 Kings,4,19,"The boy said to his father, “My head! My head!” The father said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother!”"
2 Kings,4,20,The servant took him to his mother. He lay on his mother’s lap until noon. Then he died.
2 Kings,4,21,She took him up and laid him on Elisha’s bed. Then she shut the door and went out.
2 Kings,4,22,"She called to her husband. She said, “Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys. Then I can go quickly to the man of God and come back.”"
2 Kings,4,23,"The woman’s husband said, “Why do you want to go to him today? It isn’t the New Moon or the Sabbath day.” She said, “It will be all right.”"
2 Kings,4,24,"Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, “Lead on. Don’t slow down for me unless I tell you.”"
2 Kings,4,25,"So she went to Elisha at Mount Carmel. He saw her coming from far away. So he said to his servant Gehazi, “Look, there’s the Shunammite woman!"
2 Kings,4,26,"Run to meet her! Say to her, ‘Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is the child all right?’” She answered, “Everything is all right.”"
2 Kings,4,27,"Then she came to Elisha at the hill. She caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to pull her away. But Elisha said to him, “Let her alone. She’s very upset, and the Lord has not told me about it. He has hidden it from me.”"
2 Kings,4,28,"She said, “Master, I didn’t tell you I wanted a son. I told you, ‘Don’t fool me.’”"
2 Kings,4,29,"Then Elisha said to Gehazi, “Get ready. Take my walking stick in your hand and go quickly. If you meet anyone, don’t greet him. If anyone greets you, don’t answer him. Lay my walking stick on the face of the boy.”"
2 Kings,4,30,"But the child’s mother said, “As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I won’t leave you!” So he got up and followed her."
2 Kings,4,31,"Gehazi went on ahead. He laid the walking stick on the child’s face. But the child did not talk or move. Then Gehazi went back to meet Elisha. He told Elisha, “The child has not awakened.”"
2 Kings,4,32,"Elisha came into the house. There was the child, lying dead on his bed."
2 Kings,4,33,"When Elisha entered the room, he shut the door. Only he and the child were in the room. Then Elisha prayed to the Lord."
2 Kings,4,34,He went to the bed and lay on the child. He put his mouth on the child’s mouth. He put his eyes on the child’s eyes and his hands on the child’s hands. He stretched himself out on top of the child. Then the child’s skin became warm.
2 Kings,4,35,Elisha turned away and walked around the room. Then he went back and put himself on the child again. Then the child sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
2 Kings,4,36,"Elisha called Gehazi and said, “Call the Shunammite!” And he did. When she came, Elisha said, “Pick up your son.”"
2 Kings,4,37,She came in and fell at Elisha’s feet. She bowed facedown to the floor. Then she picked up her son and went out.
2 Kings,4,38,"Elisha came to Gilgal again. There was a time of hunger in the land. A group of prophets was sitting in front of him. He said to his servant, “Put the large pot on the fire. Boil some stew for these men.”"
2 Kings,4,39,One of them went out into the field to gather plants. He found a wild vine. He picked fruit from the vine and filled his robe with it. Then he came and cut up the fruit into the pot. But they did not know what kind of fruit it was.
2 Kings,4,40,"Then they poured out the stew for the men to eat. But when they began to eat it, they shouted out, “Man of God! There’s death in the pot!” They could not eat it."
2 Kings,4,41,"Elisha told them to bring some flour. Then he threw it into the pot. He said, “Pour it out for the people to eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot."
2 Kings,4,42,"A man from Baal Shalishah came to Elisha. He brought 20 loaves of barley bread from the first harvest to Elisha. He also brought fresh grain in his sack. Then Elisha said, “Give it to the people to eat.”"
2 Kings,4,43,"Elisha’s servant said, “How can I feed 100 men with so little?” But Elisha said, “Give the bread to the people to eat. This is what the Lord says: ‘They will eat and will have food left over.’”"
2 Kings,4,44,"Then he gave it to them. The people ate and had food left over, as the Lord had said."
2 Kings,5,1,Naaman was commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was a great man to his master. He had much honor because the Lord had used him to give victory to Aram. He was a mighty and brave man. But he had a harmful skin disease.
2 Kings,5,2,The Arameans had gone out to steal from the Israelites. And they had taken a little girl as a captive from Israel. This little girl served Naaman’s wife.
2 Kings,5,3,"She said to her mistress, “I wish that my master would meet the prophet who lives in Samaria. He would heal Naaman of his disease.”"
2 Kings,5,4,Naaman went to the king. He told him what the girl from Israel had said.
2 Kings,5,5,"The king of Aram said, “Go now. And I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So Naaman left and took about 750 pounds of silver. He also took about 150 pounds of gold and ten changes of clothes with him."
2 Kings,5,6,"He brought the letter to the king of Israel. It read, “I am sending my servant Naaman to you. I’m sending him so you can heal him of his skin disease.”"
2 Kings,5,7,"The king of Israel read the letter. Then he tore his clothes to show how upset he was. He said, “I’m not God! I can’t kill and make alive again! Why does this man send someone with a harmful skin disease for me to heal? You can see that the king of Aram is trying to start trouble with me!”"
2 Kings,5,8,"Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes. So he sent a message to the king. It said, “Why have you become so upset that you tore your clothes? Let Naaman come to me. Then he will know there is a prophet in Israel!”"
2 Kings,5,9,So Naaman went with his horses and chariots to Elisha’s house. And he stood outside the door.
2 Kings,5,10,"Elisha sent a messenger to Naaman. The messenger said, “Go and wash in the Jordan River seven times. Then your skin will be healed, and you will be clean.”"
2 Kings,5,11,"Naaman became angry and left. He said, “I thought Elisha would surely come out and stand before me. I thought he would call on the name of the Lord his God. I thought he would wave his hand over the place and heal the disease!"
2 Kings,5,12,"Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, are better than all the waters of Israel! Why can’t I wash in them and become clean?” So Naaman went away very angry."
2 Kings,5,13,"But Naaman’s servants came near and talked to him. They said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, wouldn’t you have done it? Doesn’t it make more sense just to do it? After all, he only told you, ‘Wash, and you will be clean.’”"
2 Kings,5,14,So Naaman went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times. He did just as Elisha had said. Then Naaman’s skin became new again. It was like the skin of a little boy. And Naaman was clean!
2 Kings,5,15,"Naaman and all his group came back to Elisha. He stood before Elisha and said, “Look. I now know there is no God in all the earth except in Israel! Now please accept a gift from me.”"
2 Kings,5,16,"But Elisha said, “I serve the Lord. As surely as the Lord lives, I won’t accept anything.” Naaman urged him to take the gift, but he refused."
2 Kings,5,17,"Then Naaman said, “If you won’t take the gift, then please give me some dirt. Give me as much as two of my mules can carry. From now on I’ll not offer any burnt offering or sacrifice to any other gods. I’ll only offer sacrifices to the Lord."
2 Kings,5,18,"But let the Lord pardon me for this: My master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship. When he goes, he will lean on my arm. Then I must bow in that temple. May the Lord pardon me when I do that.”"
2 Kings,5,19,"Elisha said to him, “Go in peace.” Naaman left Elisha and went a short way."
2 Kings,5,20,"Gehazi was the servant of Elisha the man of God. Gehazi thought, “My master has not accepted what Naaman the Aramean brought. As surely as the Lord lives, I’ll run after him. I’ll get something from him.”"
2 Kings,5,21,"So he went after him. Naaman saw someone running after him. So he got off the chariot to meet Gehazi. He said, “Is everything all right?”"
2 Kings,5,22,"Gehazi said, “Everything is all right. My master has sent me. He said, ‘Two young men just came to me. They are from the group of the prophets in the mountains of Ephraim. Please give them 75 pounds of silver and two changes of clothes.’”"
2 Kings,5,23,"Naaman said, “Please take 150 pounds.” He urged Gehazi to take it. He tied 150 pounds of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes. Then he gave them to two of his servants. They carried them for Gehazi."
2 Kings,5,24,"When they came to the hill, Gehazi took these things from Naaman’s servants. And he put them in the house. He let Naaman’s servants go, and they left."
2 Kings,5,25,"Then he came in and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?” Gehazi said, “I didn’t go anywhere.”"
2 Kings,5,26,"But Elisha said to him, “My spirit was with you. I knew when the man turned from his chariot to meet you. This isn’t a time to receive money, clothes, olives and grapes. It isn’t a time to receive sheep, oxen, male servants and female servants."
2 Kings,5,27,"Naaman’s skin disease will come on you and your children forever.” When Gehazi left Elisha, he had the disease. He was as white as snow."
2 Kings,6,1,"The group of the prophets said to Elisha, “The place where we meet with you is too small for us."
2 Kings,6,2,"Let’s go to the Jordan River. There every man can get a pole. And let’s build a place there to live.” Elisha said, “Go.”"
2 Kings,6,3,"One of them said, “Please go with us.” Elisha said, “I will go.”"
2 Kings,6,4,"So he went with them. When they arrived at the Jordan, they cut down some trees."
2 Kings,6,5,"As one man was cutting down a tree, the head of his ax fell into the water. He yelled, “Oh, my master! I borrowed that ax!”"
2 Kings,6,6,"Elisha asked, “Where did it fall?” The man showed Elisha the place. Then Elisha cut down a stick and threw it into the water. It made the iron head float."
2 Kings,6,7,"Elisha said, “Pick up the axhead.” Then the man reached out and took it."
2 Kings,6,8,"The king of Aram was at war with Israel. He had a council meeting with his officers. He said, “I will set up my camp in this place.”"
2 Kings,6,9,"But Elisha sent a message to the king of Israel. It said, “Be careful! Don’t pass that place. The Arameans are going down there!”"
2 Kings,6,10,The king of Israel checked the place about which Elisha had warned him. Elisha warned him several times. So the king added guards in those places.
2 Kings,6,11,"The king of Aram was angry about this. He called his officers together. He said to them, “Tell me who of us is working for the king of Israel.”"
2 Kings,6,12,"One of the officers of the king of Aram said, “No, my master and king. It’s Elisha, the prophet from Israel. He can tell you what you speak in your bedroom.”"
2 Kings,6,13,"The king said, “Go and find him. Then I can send men and catch him.” The servants came back and reported, “He is in Dothan.”"
2 Kings,6,14,"Then the king sent horses, chariots and a large army to Dothan. They arrived at night and surrounded the city."
2 Kings,6,15,"The servant of Elisha got up early. When he went out, he saw an army with horses and chariots all around the city. The servant said to Elisha, “Oh, my master, what can we do?”"
2 Kings,6,16,"Elisha said, “Don’t be afraid. The army that fights for us is larger than the one against us.”"
2 Kings,6,17,"Then Elisha prayed, “Lord, open my servant’s eyes. Let him see.” The Lord opened the eyes of the young man. And he saw that the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha."
2 Kings,6,18,"As the enemy came down toward Elisha, he prayed to the Lord. He said, “Make these people blind.” So the Lord made the Aramean army blind, as Elisha had asked."
2 Kings,6,19,"Elisha said to them, “This is not the right road. This is not the right city. Follow me. I’ll take you to the man you are looking for.” Then Elisha led them to Samaria."
2 Kings,6,20,"After they entered Samaria, Elisha said, “Lord, open these men’s eyes so they can see.” So the Lord opened their eyes. And the Aramean army saw that they were inside the city of Samaria!"
2 Kings,6,21,"The king of Israel saw the Aramean army. He said to Elisha, “My father, should I kill them? Should I kill them?”"
2 Kings,6,22,"Elisha answered, “Don’t kill them. You wouldn’t kill people whom you captured with your sword and bow. Give them food and water. And let them eat and drink. Then let them go home to their master.”"
2 Kings,6,23,So he prepared a great feast for the Aramean army. They ate and drank. Then the king sent them away. They went home to their master. The soldiers of Aram did not come anymore into the land of Israel.
2 Kings,6,24,"Later, Ben-Hadad king of Aram gathered all his army. He went to surround and attack Samaria."
2 Kings,6,25,There was a time of terrible hunger in Samaria. It was so bad that a donkey’s head was sold for about two pounds of silver. Half of a pint of dove’s dung sold for about two ounces of silver.
2 Kings,6,26,"The king of Israel was passing by on the wall. A woman yelled out to him, “Help me, my master and king!”"
2 Kings,6,27,"The king said, “If the Lord doesn’t help you, how can I? Can I get help from the threshing floor or from the winepress?”"
2 Kings,6,28,"Then the king said to her, “What is your trouble?” She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son so we can eat him today. Then we will eat my son tomorrow.’"
2 Kings,6,29,"So we boiled my son and ate him. Then the next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son so we can eat him.’ But she had hidden him.”"
2 Kings,6,30,"When the king heard the woman’s words, he tore his clothes to show how upset he was. He walked along the wall. The people looked and saw he had on rough cloth under his clothes. This was to show his sadness."
2 Kings,6,31,"He said, “The head of Elisha son of Shaphat will be taken from his body today! May God punish me terribly if this doesn’t happen!”"
2 Kings,6,32,"The king sent a messenger to Elisha. Elisha was sitting in his house. And the elders were sitting with him. But before the messenger arrived, Elisha spoke to them. He said, “See, this murderer is sending men to take off my head. When the messenger arrives, shut the door. Hold it and don’t let him in. The sound of his master’s feet is behind him.”"
2 Kings,6,33,"While Elisha was still talking with the leaders, the king came. He said, “This trouble has come from the Lord. Why should I wait for the Lord any longer?”"
2 Kings,7,1,"Elisha said, “Listen to the Lord’s word. This is what he says: ‘About this time tomorrow 7 quarts of fine flour will be sold for two-fifths of an ounce of silver. And 13 quarts of barley will be sold for two-fifths of an ounce of silver. This will happen at the gate of Samaria.’”"
2 Kings,7,2,"Then the officer who was close to the king answered Elisha. He said, “Even if the Lord opened windows in heaven, that couldn’t happen.” Elisha said, “Because you have said that, you will see it with your eyes. But you will not eat any of it.”"
2 Kings,7,3,"There were four men with a harmful skin disease at the entrance to the city gate. They said to each other, “Why do we sit here until we die?"
2 Kings,7,4,"A time of hunger is in the city. So if we go into the city, we will die there. If we stay here, we will die. So let’s go to the Aramean camp. If they let us live, we will live. If they kill us, then we die.”"
2 Kings,7,5,"So they got up at twilight. And they went to the Aramean camp. But when they arrived, no one was there."
2 Kings,7,6,"The Lord had caused the Aramean army to hear the sound of chariots, horses and a large army. They had said to each other, “The king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us!”"
2 Kings,7,7,"So they ran away in the twilight. They left their tents, horses and donkeys. They left the camp standing and ran for their lives."
2 Kings,7,8,"The men with the skin disease came to the edge of the camp. Then they went into one of the tents. They ate and drank. They carried silver, gold and clothes out of the camp and hid them. Then they came back and entered another tent. They carried things from this tent and hid them, also."
2 Kings,7,9,"Then they said to each other, “We’re doing wrong. Today we have good news, but we are silent. If we wait until the sun comes up, we’ll be punished. Let’s go now and tell the people in the king’s palace.”"
2 Kings,7,10,"So they went and called to the gatekeepers of the city. They said, “We went to the Aramean camp. But no one is there. We didn’t hear anyone. The horses and donkeys were still tied up, and the tents were still standing.”"
2 Kings,7,11,Then the gatekeepers shouted out and told the people in the palace.
2 Kings,7,12,"So the king got up in the night. He said to his officers, “I’ll tell you what the Arameans are doing to us. They know we are hungry. They have gone out of the camp to hide in the field. They’re saying, ‘When the Israelites come out of the city, we’ll capture them alive. Then we’ll enter the city.’”"
2 Kings,7,13,"One of his officers answered, “Let some men take five horses still left in the city. These men are like all the Israelites who are left. They are also about to die. Let’s send them to see what has happened.”"
2 Kings,7,14,"So the men took two chariots with horses. The king sent them after the Aramean army. He told them, “Go and see what has happened.”"
2 Kings,7,15,The men followed the Aramean army as far as the Jordan River. The road was full of clothes and equipment. The Arameans had thrown these things away as they had hurried away. So the messengers came back and told the king.
2 Kings,7,16,Then the people went out and took valuable things from the Aramean camp. So 7 quarts of fine flour were sold for two-fifths of an ounce of silver. And 13 quarts of barley were sold for two-fifths of an ounce of silver. It happened just as the Lord had said.
2 Kings,7,17,The king chose the officer who was close to him to guard the gate. But the people ran over the officer so that he died. This happened just as the man of God had told the king. Elisha had said it when the king came to his house.
2 Kings,7,18,"He had said, “Thirteen quarts of barley and 7 quarts of fine flour will each sell for two-fifths of an ounce of silver. It will happen about this time tomorrow at the gate of Samaria.”"
2 Kings,7,19,"But the officer had answered, “Even if the Lord opened windows in heaven, that couldn’t happen.” And Elisha had told him, “Because you have said that, you will see it with your eyes. But you won’t eat any of it.”"
2 Kings,7,20,"It happened to the officer just that way. The people ran over him in the gate, and he died."
2 Kings,8,1,"Elisha talked to the woman whose son he had brought back to life. He said, “Get up and go with your family. Stay any place you can. This is because the Lord has called for a time of hunger. It will last seven years.”"
2 Kings,8,2,So the woman got up and did as the man of God said. She left with her family. And they stayed in the land of the Philistines for seven years.
2 Kings,8,3,After seven years she came back from the land of the Philistines. She went to beg the king for her house and land back.
2 Kings,8,4,"The king was talking with Gehazi. He was the servant of the man of God. The king had said to Gehazi, “Please tell me all the great things Elisha has done.”"
2 Kings,8,5,"Now Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought a dead person back to life. Just then the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life came and begged the king for her house and land. Gehazi said, “My master and king, this is the woman. And this is the son Elisha brought back to life.”"
2 Kings,8,6,"The king asked the woman, and she told him about it. Then the king chose an officer to help her. The king said, “Give the woman everything that is hers. Give her all the money made from her land from the day she left until now.”"
2 Kings,8,7,"Elisha went to Damascus. Now Ben-Hadad king of Aram was sick. Someone told him, “The man of God has come here.”"
2 Kings,8,8,"Then the king said to Hazael, “Take a gift in your hand and go meet him. Ask the Lord through him if I will get well from my sickness.”"
2 Kings,8,9,"So Hazael went to meet Elisha. He took with him a gift. It was 40 camels loaded with every good thing in Damascus. He came and stood before Elisha. Hazael said, “Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram sent me to you. He asks if he will get well from his sickness.”"
2 Kings,8,10,"Then Elisha said to Hazael, “Go and tell Ben-Hadad, ‘You will surely get well.’ But the Lord has told me he will really die.”"
2 Kings,8,11,Elisha stared at Hazael until Hazael felt ashamed. Then Elisha cried.
2 Kings,8,12,"Hazael asked, “Why are you crying, master?” Elisha answered, “Because I know what evil you will do to the Israelites. You will burn their strong, walled cities with fire. You will kill their young men with swords. You will throw their babies to the ground. You will split open their pregnant women.”"
2 Kings,8,13,"Hazael said, “I, your servant, am only a dog. How could I do such things?” Elisha answered, “The Lord has shown me that you will be king over Aram.”"
2 Kings,8,14,"Then Hazael left Elisha and came to his master. Ben-Hadad said to Hazael, “What did Elisha say to you?” Hazael answered, “He told me that you will surely get well.”"
2 Kings,8,15,"But the next day Hazael took a blanket and dipped it in water. Then he put it over Ben-Hadad’s face, and he died. So Hazael became king in Ben-Hadad’s place."
2 Kings,8,16,Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat became king of Judah. This was during Joram’s fifth year as king of Israel. Joram was the son of Ahab.
2 Kings,8,17,Jehoram was 32 years old when he began to rule. He ruled eight years in Jerusalem.
2 Kings,8,18,But Jehoram followed the ways of the kings of Israel. This was just as the family of Ahab had done. It was because Ahab’s daughter was Jehoram’s wife. Jehoram did what the Lord said was wrong.
2 Kings,8,19,But the Lord would not destroy Judah because of his servant David. The Lord had promised that David and his children would always have a kingdom.
2 Kings,8,20,In Jehoram’s time Edom broke away from Judah’s rule. The people of Edom chose their own king.
2 Kings,8,21,So Jehoram and all his chariots went to Zair. At night the Edomites came around him and his chariot commanders. Jehoram got up and attacked the Edomites. But his army ran away to their tents.
2 Kings,8,22,So the Edomites broke away from the rule of Judah. And they are still separate today. At the same time Libnah also broke away from Judah’s rule.
2 Kings,8,23,The other acts of Jehoram and all the things he did are written down. They are in the book of the history of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,8,24,Jehoram died and was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem. Jehoram’s son Ahaziah ruled in his place.
2 Kings,8,25,Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah. This was during Joram’s twelfth year as king of Israel. Joram was the son of Ahab.
2 Kings,8,26,Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king. He ruled one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah. She was a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.
2 Kings,8,27,"Ahaziah followed the ways of Ahab’s family. He did what the Lord said was wrong, as Ahab’s family had done. He did this because he was a son-in-law in Ahab’s family."
2 Kings,8,28,Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to Ramoth in Gilead. There they fought against Hazael king of Aram. The Arameans wounded Joram.
2 Kings,8,29,So King Joram returned to Jezreel to heal from the injuries. (He had been wounded by the Arameans at Ramoth. This was when he fought Hazael king of Aram.) And Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram. He went to see Joram son of Ahab at Jezreel because he had been wounded.
2 Kings,9,1,"Elisha called a man from the group of the prophets. Elisha said, “Tighten your clothes around you. And take this small bottle of olive oil in your hand. Go to Ramoth in Gilead."
2 Kings,9,2,"When you arrive, find Jehu son of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat is the son of Nimshi. Go in and make Jehu get up from among his brothers. Take him to an inner room."
2 Kings,9,3,"Take the bottle and pour the oil on Jehu’s head. Say, ‘This is what the Lord says: I have appointed you king over Israel.’ Then open the door and run away. Don’t wait!”"
2 Kings,9,4,"So the young man, the prophet, went to Ramoth in Gilead."
2 Kings,9,5,"When he arrived, he saw the officers of the army sitting together. He said, “Commander, I have a message for you.” Jehu asked, “For which one of us?” The young man said, “For you, commander.”"
2 Kings,9,6,"Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the young prophet poured the olive oil on Jehu’s head. He said to Jehu, “This is what the Lord of Israel says: ‘I have appointed you king over the Lord’s people, Israel."
2 Kings,9,7,You must destroy the family of Ahab your master. I will punish Jezebel for the deaths of my servants the prophets. And I will punish her for all the Lord’s servants who were murdered.
2 Kings,9,8,So all Ahab’s family will die. I will not let any male child in Ahab’s family live in Israel. It does not matter if he is a slave or a free person.
2 Kings,9,9,I will make Ahab’s family like the family of Jeroboam son of Nebat. They will be like the family of Baasha son of Ahijah.
2 Kings,9,10,The dogs will eat Jezebel in the portion of land at Jezreel. And no one will bury her.’” Then the young prophet opened the door and ran away.
2 Kings,9,11,"Jehu went back to his master’s officers. One of them said to Jehu, “Is everything all right? Why did this crazy man come to you?” Jehu answered, “You know the man and how he talks.”"
2 Kings,9,12,"They answered, “That’s not true! Tell us.” Jehu said, “He said, ‘This is what the Lord says: I have appointed you to be king over Israel.’”"
2 Kings,9,13,"Then the officers hurried. Each man took off his own coat. They put them on the stairs for Jehu. Then they blew the trumpet. They said, “Jehu is king!”"
2 Kings,9,14,So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat made plans against Joram. (Jehoshaphat was the son of Nimshi.) Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth in Gilead from Hazael king of Aram.
2 Kings,9,15,"But King Joram had to return to Israel to heal from the injuries the Arameans had given him. He received these injuries when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Jehu said, “If you agree with this, don’t let anyone leave the city. They might tell the news in Jezreel.”"
2 Kings,9,16,Then he got into his chariot and set out for Jezreel. Joram was resting there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.
2 Kings,9,17,"The lookout was standing on the watchtower in Jezreel. He saw Jehu’s troops coming. He said, “I see some soldiers!” Joram said, “Take a horseman and send him to meet them. Tell him to ask, ‘Do you bring good news?’”"
2 Kings,9,18,"So the horseman rode out to meet Jehu. The horseman said, “This is what the king says: ‘Do you bring good news?’” Jehu said, “That’s none of your business! Come along behind me.” The lookout reported, “The messenger reached them. But he is not coming back.”"
2 Kings,9,19,"So Joram sent out a second horseman. This rider came to Jehu’s group and said, “This is what the king says: ‘Do you bring good news?’” Jehu answered, “That’s none of your business! Come along behind me.”"
2 Kings,9,20,"The lookout reported, “The second man reached them. But he is not coming back. The man in the chariot is driving like Jehu son of Nimshi. He drives as if he were crazy!”"
2 Kings,9,21,"Joram said, “Get my chariot ready.” Then the servant got Joram’s chariot ready. Joram and Ahaziah king of Judah went out. Each king went in his own chariot to meet Jehu. And they met him at the property of Naboth the Jezreelite."
2 Kings,9,22,"When Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Do you bring good news, Jehu?” Jehu answered, “There will never be any good news as long as your mother Jezebel worships idols and uses witchcraft.”"
2 Kings,9,23,"Joram turned the horses to run away. He yelled to Ahaziah, “It’s a trick, Ahaziah!”"
2 Kings,9,24,Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between his shoulders. The arrow went through Joram’s heart. And he fell down in his chariot.
2 Kings,9,25,"Jehu ordered Bidkar, his chariot officer, “Pick up Joram’s body. Throw it into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember when you and I rode together with Joram’s father Ahab. The Lord made this prophecy against him:"
2 Kings,9,26,"‘Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and his sons, says the Lord. So I will punish Ahab in his field, says the Lord.’ So take Joram’s body and throw it into the field, as the Lord has said.”"
2 Kings,9,27,"When Ahaziah king of Judah saw this, he ran away toward Beth Haggan. Jehu chased him, saying, “Shoot Ahaziah, too!” Ahaziah was wounded in his chariot on the way up to Gur near Ibleam. Ahaziah got as far as Megiddo but died there."
2 Kings,9,28,His servants carried his body in a chariot to Jerusalem. They buried him with his ancestors in his tomb in Jerusalem.
2 Kings,9,29,(Ahaziah had become king over Judah in Joram’s eleventh year as king. Joram was the son of Ahab.)
2 Kings,9,30,"When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard about it. She put paint on her eyes and fixed her hair. Then she looked out the window."
2 Kings,9,31,"Jehu entered the city gate. And Jezebel said, “Have you come in peace, you Zimri, you who killed your master?”"
2 Kings,9,32,"Jehu looked up at the window. He said, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three eunuchs looked out from the window at Jehu."
2 Kings,9,33,"Jehu said to them, “Throw her down!” So they threw Jezebel down. And the horses ran over her body. Some of her blood splashed on the wall and on the horses."
2 Kings,9,34,"Jehu went into the house and ate and drank. Then he said, “Now see about this cursed woman. Bury her, because she is a king’s daughter.”"
2 Kings,9,35,"The men went to bury Jezebel. But they could not find her body. They could only find the skull, feet and palms of her hands."
2 Kings,9,36,"So they came back and told Jehu. Then Jehu said, “The Lord said this through his servant Elijah the Tishbite: ‘The dogs will eat the body of Jezebel in the portion of land at Jezreel."
2 Kings,9,37,Her body will be like manure on the field in the land at Jezreel. Then people cannot say that the body is Jezebel.’”
2 Kings,10,1,"Ahab’s family had 70 sons in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria. He sent them to the officers and elders of Jezreel. He also sent them to the guardians of the sons of Ahab. Jehu said,"
2 Kings,10,2,"“You have chariots, horses and a city with strong walls. You also have weapons. When you get this letter,"
2 Kings,10,3,choose the best and most worthy person among your master’s sons. Make him king. Then fight for your master’s family.”
2 Kings,10,4,"But the officers and elders of Jezreel were very frightened. They said, “The two kings could not stop Jehu. So, surely we can’t either.”"
2 Kings,10,5,"The palace manager, the city governor, the elders and the guardians sent a message to Jehu. They said, “We are your servants. We will do everything you tell us to do. We won’t make any man king. Do whatever you think is best.”"
2 Kings,10,6,"Then Jehu wrote a second letter. It said, “If you are on my side and will obey me, cut off the heads of your master’s sons. And come to me at Jezreel tomorrow about this time.” Now there were 70 sons of the king’s family. They were with the leading men of the city who were their guardians."
2 Kings,10,7,The leaders received the letter. Then they took the king’s sons and killed all 70 of them. They put their heads in baskets. And they sent them to Jehu at Jezreel.
2 Kings,10,8,"The messenger came to Jehu. He told Jehu, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons!” Then Jehu said, “Lay the heads in two piles at the city gate until morning.”"
2 Kings,10,9,"In the morning, Jehu went out and stood before the people. He said to them, “You are innocent. Look, I made plans against my master. I killed him. But who killed all these?"
2 Kings,10,10,You should know that nothing the Lord said will fail. Everything the Lord said about Ahab’s family will come true. The Lord has spoken through his servant Elijah. And the Lord has done what he said.”
2 Kings,10,11,"So Jehu killed everyone of Ahab’s family in Jezreel who was still alive. He also killed all Ahab’s leading men, close friends and priests. No one was left alive who had helped Ahab."
2 Kings,10,12,Then Jehu left and went to Samaria. He went on the road to Beth Eked of the Shepherds.
2 Kings,10,13,"There Jehu met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah. Jehu said, “Who are you?” They answered, “We are relatives of Ahaziah. We have come down to visit the families of the king and the king’s mother.”"
2 Kings,10,14,"Then Jehu said, “Take them alive!” So they captured Ahaziah’s relatives alive. But they killed them at the well near Beth Eked. There were 42 of them. Jehu did not leave anyone alive."
2 Kings,10,15,"After Jehu left there, he met Jehonadab son of Recab. He was also on his way to meet Jehu. Jehu greeted him and said, “Are you as good a friend to me as I am to you?” Jehonadab answered, “Yes, I am.” Jehu said, “If you are, then give me your hand.” So Jehonadab gave him his hand, and Jehu pulled him into the chariot."
2 Kings,10,16,"Jehu said, “Come with me. You can see how strong my feelings are for the Lord.” So Jehu had Jehonadab ride in his chariot."
2 Kings,10,17,"When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed all of Ahab’s family. He did this until he had destroyed all of those who were left. Jehu did what the Lord had told Elijah would happen."
2 Kings,10,18,"Then Jehu gathered all the people together. He said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little. But Jehu will serve Baal much."
2 Kings,10,19,Now call for me all Baal’s prophets and priests. Call all the people who worship Baal. Don’t let anyone miss this meeting. I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who is not there will not remain alive.” But Jehu was tricking them so he could destroy the worshipers of Baal.
2 Kings,10,20,"He said, “Prepare a holy meeting for Baal.” So they announced the meeting."
2 Kings,10,21,Then Jehu sent word through all Israel. All the worshipers of Baal came. Not one stayed home. They came into the temple of Baal. The temple was filled from one side to the other.
2 Kings,10,22,"Jehu spoke to the man who kept the robes. He said, “Bring out robes for all the worshipers of Baal.” So he brought out robes for them."
2 Kings,10,23,"Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Recab went into the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the worshipers of Baal, “Look around. Be sure there are no servants of the Lord with you. Be sure there are only people here who worship Baal.”"
2 Kings,10,24,"So the worshipers of Baal went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. But Jehu had 80 men waiting outside. He told them, “Don’t let anyone escape. If you let anyone escape, you must pay with your own life.”"
2 Kings,10,25,"Jehu finished offering the burnt offering. Then he spoke to the guards and the captains. He said, “Go in and kill the worshipers of Baal! Don’t let anyone come out.” So the guards and captains killed the worshipers of Baal with the sword. They threw the bodies of the worshipers of Baal out. Then they went to the inner rooms of the temple."
2 Kings,10,26,They brought out the pillars of the temple of Baal and burned them.
2 Kings,10,27,"Then they tore down the stone pillar of Baal. They also tore down the temple of Baal. They made it into a sewage pit, and it is still one today."
2 Kings,10,28,So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel.
2 Kings,10,29,But he did not stop doing the sins Jeroboam son of Nebat had done. Jeroboam had caused Israel to sin. They worshiped the golden calves in Bethel and Dan.
2 Kings,10,30,"The Lord said to Jehu, “You have done well. You have done what I said was right. You have done to the family of Ahab as I wanted. Your descendants as far as your great-great-grandchildren will be kings of Israel.”"
2 Kings,10,31,But Jehu was not careful to keep the teachings of the Lord with all his heart. He did not stop doing the same sins Jeroboam had done. Jeroboam had caused Israel to sin.
2 Kings,10,32,At that time the Lord began to make Israel smaller. Hazael defeated the Israelites in all the land of Israel.
2 Kings,10,33,"He took all the land on the east side of the Jordan. This was the land of Gilead. (It was the region of Gad, Reuben and Manasseh.) He took land from Aroer by the Arnon Ravine through Gilead to Bashan."
2 Kings,10,34,The other things Jehu did are written down. Everything he did and all his victories are recorded. They are in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,10,35,Jehu died and was buried in Samaria. Jehu’s son Jehoahaz became king in his place.
2 Kings,10,36,Jehu was king over Israel in Samaria for 28 years.
2 Kings,11,1,"Now Ahaziah’s mother, Athaliah, saw that her son was dead. Then she killed all the royal family."
2 Kings,11,2,"But Jehosheba took Joash, Ahaziah’s son. She stole him from among the other sons of the king who were about to be murdered. (Jehosheba was King Jehoram’s daughter and Ahaziah’s sister.) She put Joash and his nurse in a bedroom. She hid Joash from Athaliah. So he was not killed."
2 Kings,11,3,He was hidden with her in the Temple of the Lord for six years. During that time Athaliah ruled the land.
2 Kings,11,4,"In the seventh year Jehoiada sent for the commanders of groups of 100 men. He sent for guards and the Carites, the royal bodyguards. He brought them together in the Temple of the Lord. Then he made an agreement with them. There, in the Temple of the Lord, he made them promise loyalty. Then he showed them the king’s son."
2 Kings,11,5,"He commanded them, “This is what you must do. A third of you who come in on the Sabbath will guard the king’s palace."
2 Kings,11,6,Another third of you will be at the Sur Gate. And another third will be at the gate behind the guard. This way you will guard the Temple.
2 Kings,11,7,Two groups will go off duty on the Sabbath. They must protect the Temple of the Lord for the king.
2 Kings,11,8,"All of you must stand around the king. Each man must have his weapon in his hand. If anyone comes near, kill him. Stay close to the king when he goes out and when he comes in.”"
2 Kings,11,9,The commanders over 100 men obeyed everything Jehoiada the priest had commanded. Each one took his men who were beginning their Sabbath duty. Each one also took those who were ending their Sabbath duty. Both groups came to Jehoiada the priest.
2 Kings,11,10,And he gave spears and shields to the commanders. They used to belong to King David. They were kept in the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings,11,11,Then each of the guards took his place. Each man had his weapon in his hand. There were guards from the south side of the Temple to the north side. They stood by the altar and the Temple and around the king.
2 Kings,11,12,"Jehoiada brought out the king’s son. He put the crown on Joash. Then he gave Joash a copy of the Agreement with the Lord. They appointed him king and poured olive oil on him. They clapped their hands and said, “Long live the king!”"
2 Kings,11,13,Athaliah heard the noise of the guards and the people. So she came to the people at the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings,11,14,"She looked, and there was the king. He was standing by the pillar, as the custom was. The officers and trumpeters were standing beside him. All the people of the land were very happy and were blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes to show how upset she was. She screamed, “Traitors! Traitors!”"
2 Kings,11,15,"Jehoiada the priest gave orders to the commanders of 100 men who led the army. He said, “Surround her with soldiers. Kill with a sword anyone who follows her.” He said this because he had said, “Don’t put Athaliah to death in the Temple of the Lord.”"
2 Kings,11,16,So they caught her when she came to where the horses enter the palace grounds. There she was put to death.
2 Kings,11,17,Then Jehoiada made an agreement. It was between the Lord and the king and the people. They agreed to be the Lord’s special people. He also made an agreement between the king and the people.
2 Kings,11,18,"All the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols into small pieces. And they killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars. Then Jehoiada the priest placed guards at the Temple of the Lord."
2 Kings,11,19,"He took with him the commanders of 100 men and the Carites, the royal bodyguards. He took the guards and all the people of the land. Together they took the king out of the Temple of the Lord. They went into the palace through the gate of the guards. Then the king sat on the royal throne."
2 Kings,11,20,So all the people of Judah were very happy. And Jerusalem had peace because Athaliah had been put to death with the sword at the palace.
2 Kings,11,21,Joash was seven years old when he became king.
2 Kings,12,1,Joash became king of Judah in Jehu’s seventh year as king of Israel. Joash ruled for 40 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah. She was from Beersheba.
2 Kings,12,2,Joash did what the Lord said was right all the time Jehoiada the priest taught him.
2 Kings,12,3,But the places where false gods were worshiped were not removed. The people still made sacrifices and burned incense there.
2 Kings,12,4,"Joash said to the priests, “Take all the money brought as offerings to the Temple of the Lord. This includes the money each person owes in taxes. It also includes the money each person promises or brings to the Lord because he wants to."
2 Kings,12,5,Each priest must take the money from the people he serves. Then the priests must repair any damage they find in the Temple.”
2 Kings,12,6,But by the twenty-third year of Joash the priests still had not repaired the Temple.
2 Kings,12,7,"So King Joash called for Jehoiada the priest and the other priests. He said to them, “Why are you not repairing the damage of the Temple? Don’t take any more money from the people you serve. But hand over the money for the repair of the Temple.”"
2 Kings,12,8,The priests agreed not to take any more money from the people. And they agreed not to repair the Temple themselves.
2 Kings,12,9,But Jehoiada the priest took a box and made a hole in the top of it. Then he put it by the altar. It was on the right side as the people came into the Temple of the Lord. The priests guarding the doorway put all the money brought to the Temple of the Lord into the box.
2 Kings,12,10,"Each time the priests saw that the box was full of money, the king’s royal assistant and the high priest came. They counted the money that had been brought to the Temple of the Lord. Then they put it into bags."
2 Kings,12,11,Next they weighed the money. They gave it to the men who were in charge of the work on the Temple. With it they paid the carpenters and the builders who worked on the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings,12,12,They also paid the stoneworkers and stonecutters. They used the money to buy timber and cut stone. The money was used to repair the damage of the Temple of the Lord. It paid for everything.
2 Kings,12,13,"The money brought into the Temple of the Lord was not used to make silver cups. It was not used for wick trimmers, bowls or trumpets. And it wasn’t used for any gold or silver vessels."
2 Kings,12,14,They paid the money to the workers. And the workers used it to repair the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings,12,15,They did not make the men tell how the money was spent. This was because the men were honest.
2 Kings,12,16,The money from the penalty offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the Temple of the Lord. It belonged to the priests.
2 Kings,12,17,About this time Hazael king of Aram attacked Gath and captured it. Then he went to attack Jerusalem.
2 Kings,12,18,"But Joash king of Judah took all the holy things his ancestors had given. His ancestors were the kings of Judah—Jehoshaphat, Jehoram and Ahaziah. He also took his own holy things. He took the gold that was found in the treasuries of the Temple of the Lord. And he took the gold from the palace. Joash sent all this treasure to Hazael king of Aram. Then Hazael turned away from Jerusalem."
2 Kings,12,19,Everything else Joash did is written down. It is in the book of the history of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,12,20,His officers made plans against him. They killed him at Beth Millo on the road to Silla.
2 Kings,12,21,"The officers who killed him were Jozabad son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer. Joash was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem. And Amaziah, his son, became king in his place."
2 Kings,13,1,Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king over Israel in Samaria. This was during Joash’s twenty-third year as king of Judah. Joash was the son of Ahaziah. And Jehoahaz ruled 17 years.
2 Kings,13,2,He did what the Lord said was wrong. Jehoahaz did the same sins Jeroboam son of Nebat had done. Jeroboam had caused Israel to sin. And Jehoahaz did not stop doing these same sins.
2 Kings,13,3,So the Lord was angry with Israel. And he gave them into the power of Hazael king of Aram and his son Ben-Hadad.
2 Kings,13,4,"Then Jehoahaz begged the Lord, and the Lord listened to him. The Lord had seen the troubles of Israel. He saw how terribly the king of Aram was treating the Israelites."
2 Kings,13,5,So he gave Israel a man to save them. And they escaped from the Arameans. So the Israelites lived in their own homes as they had before.
2 Kings,13,6,But the Israelites still did not stop doing the same sins that the family of Jeroboam had done. He had caused Israel to sin. They continued doing those sins. The Asherah idol also was left standing in Samaria.
2 Kings,13,7,"Nothing was left of Jehoahaz’s army except 50 horsemen, 10 chariots and 10,000 foot soldiers. The king of Aram had destroyed them. He had made them like dust at the time of threshing."
2 Kings,13,8,Everything else Jehoahaz did and all his victories are written down. They are in the book of history of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,13,9,Jehoahaz died and was buried in Samaria. His son Jehoash became king in his place.
2 Kings,13,10,Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king of Israel in Samaria. This was during Joash’s thirty-seventh year as king of Judah. Jehoash ruled 16 years.
2 Kings,13,11,He did what the Lord said was wrong. He did not stop doing the same sins Jeroboam son of Nebat had done. Jeroboam had caused Israel to sin. And Jehoash continued to do the same thing.
2 Kings,13,12,Everything else he did and all his victories are written down. This includes his war against Amaziah king of Judah. All this is written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,13,13,"Jehoash died, and Jeroboam took his place on the throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel."
2 Kings,13,14,"At this time Elisha became sick. (Later, he died from this illness.) Jehoash king of Israel went to Elisha and cried for him. Jehoash said, “My father, my father! The chariots of Israel and their horsemen!”"
2 Kings,13,15,"Elisha said to Jehoash, “Take a bow and arrows.” So he took a bow and arrows."
2 Kings,13,16,"Then Elisha said to him, “Put your hand on the bow.” So Jehoash put his hand on the bow. Then Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands."
2 Kings,13,17,"Elisha said, “Open the east window.” So Jehoash opened the window. Then Elisha said, “Shoot,” and Jehoash shot. Elisha said, “The Lord’s arrow of victory over Aram! You will defeat the Arameans at Aphek until you destroy them.”"
2 Kings,13,18,"Elisha said, “Take the arrows.” So Jehoash took them. Then Elisha said to him, “Hit the ground.” So Jehoash hit the ground three times. Then he stopped."
2 Kings,13,19,"The man of God was angry with him. Elisha said, “You should have hit five or six times! Then you would have defeated Aram until you had completely destroyed it! But now you will defeat it only three times.”"
2 Kings,13,20,So Elisha died and was buried. At that time groups of Moabites would rob the land in the springtime.
2 Kings,13,21,"Once the Israelites were burying a man. Suddenly they saw a group of Moabites coming. The Israelites threw the dead man into Elisha’s grave. When the man touched Elisha’s bones, the man came back to life. And he stood up on his feet."
2 Kings,13,22,"During all the days Jehoahaz was king, Hazael king of Aram troubled Israel."
2 Kings,13,23,"But the Lord was kind to the Israelites. He had mercy on them. And he helped them because of his agreement with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He did not destroy them or reject them."
2 Kings,13,24,Hazael king of Aram died. And his son Ben-Hadad became king in his place.
2 Kings,13,25,"During a war Hazael had taken some cities from Jehoahaz, Jehoash’s father. But now Jehoash took back those cities from Hazael’s son Ben-Hadad. He defeated Ben-Hadad three times and took back the cities of Israel."
2 Kings,14,1,Amaziah son of Joash became king of Judah. This was during the second year Jehoash son of Jehoahaz was king of Israel.
2 Kings,14,2,Amaziah was 25 years old when he became king. He ruled 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jehoaddin. She was from Jerusalem.
2 Kings,14,3,Amaziah did what the Lord said was right. Amaziah did everything his father Joash had done. But he did not do as David his ancestor had done.
2 Kings,14,4,The places where false gods were worshiped were not removed. The people still sacrificed and burned incense there.
2 Kings,14,5,Amaziah took strong control of the kingdom. Then he put the officers to death who had killed his father the king.
2 Kings,14,6,But he did not put to death the children of the murderers. This is because of the rule written in the Book of the Teachings of Moses. The Lord had commanded: “Fathers must not be put to death when their children do wrong. And children must not be put to death when their fathers do wrong. Each person must die for his own sins.”
2 Kings,14,7,"Amaziah killed 10,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. In a battle Amaziah took the city of Sela. He called it Joktheel, and it is still called that today."
2 Kings,14,8,"Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz. (Jehoahaz was the son of Jehu, king of Israel.) The message read, “Come, let’s meet face to face in battle.”"
2 Kings,14,9,"Then Jehoash king of Israel answered Amaziah king of Judah. Jehoash said, “A little thornbush in Lebanon sent a message to a big cedar tree in Lebanon. It said, ‘Let your daughter marry my son.’ But then a wild animal from Lebanon came by. It walked on and crushed the thornbush."
2 Kings,14,10,"Yes, you have defeated Edom. But you have become proud because of your victory over Edom. Stay at home and brag! Don’t ask for trouble by fighting me. If you do, you and Judah will be defeated.”"
2 Kings,14,11,But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went to attack. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other in battle at Beth Shemesh in Judah.
2 Kings,14,12,Israel defeated Judah. Every man of Judah ran away to his home.
2 Kings,14,13,"At Beth Shemesh Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah. Amaziah was the son of Joash, who was the son of Ahaziah. Then Jehoash went to Jerusalem. He broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate. This part of the wall was about 600 feet long."
2 Kings,14,14,Then he took all the gold and silver and everything in the Temple of the Lord. And he took the treasuries of the palace. He also took some hostages and returned to Samaria.
2 Kings,14,15,The other acts of Jehoash and his victories are written down. This includes his war against Amaziah king of Judah. All this is in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,14,16,Jehoash died and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And his son Jeroboam became king in his place.
2 Kings,14,17,Amaziah son of Joash was king of Judah. He lived 15 years after Jehoash king of Israel died. Jehoash was the son of Jehoahaz.
2 Kings,14,18,The other things Amaziah did as king are written down. They are in the book of the history of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,14,19,The people made plans in Jerusalem against Amaziah. So he ran away to the town of Lachish. But they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him.
2 Kings,14,20,"They brought his body back on horses. And he was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem, the city of David."
2 Kings,14,21,Then all the people of Judah chose Azariah to be king. He became king in place of his father Amaziah. Azariah was 16 years old.
2 Kings,14,22,He rebuilt the town of Elath and made it part of Judah again. He did this after Amaziah died.
2 Kings,14,23,Jeroboam son of Jehoash became king of Israel in Samaria. This was during the fifteenth year Amaziah was king of Judah. (Amaziah was the son of Joash.) And Jeroboam ruled 41 years.
2 Kings,14,24,He did what the Lord said was wrong. Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to sin. And Jeroboam son of Jehoash did not stop doing the same sins.
2 Kings,14,25,Jeroboam won back Israel’s border from Lebo Hamath to the Dead Sea. This happened as the Lord of Israel had said. He said it through his servant Jonah son of Amittai. He was the prophet from Gath Hepher.
2 Kings,14,26,"The Lord had seen how the Israelites, both slave and free, were suffering terribly. No one was left who could help Israel."
2 Kings,14,27,But the Lord had not said that he would completely destroy Israel from the world. So he saved the Israelites through Jeroboam son of Jehoash.
2 Kings,14,28,Everything else Jeroboam did is written down. All his victories are recorded. He won back Damascus and Hamath for Israel. (They had belonged to Judah.) All this is written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,14,29,"Jeroboam died and was buried with his ancestors, the kings of Israel. Jeroboam’s son Zechariah became king in his place."
2 Kings,15,1,Azariah son of Amaziah became king of Judah. This was during Jeroboam’s twenty-seventh year as king of Israel.
2 Kings,15,2,"Azariah was 16 years old when he became king. He ruled 52 years in Jerusalem. His mother was named Jecoliah, and she was from Jerusalem."
2 Kings,15,3,He did what the Lord said was right. He obeyed God just as his father Amaziah had done.
2 Kings,15,4,But the places where false gods were worshiped were not removed. So the people still made sacrifices and burned incense there.
2 Kings,15,5,"The Lord struck Azariah with a harmful skin disease. He had this disease until the day he died. He lived in a separate house. Jotham, the king’s son, was in charge of the palace. He governed the people of the land."
2 Kings,15,6,All the other things Azariah did are written down. They are in the book of the history of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,15,7,Azariah died and was buried near his ancestors in Jerusalem. And his son Jotham became king in his place.
2 Kings,15,8,Zechariah son of Jeroboam was king over Israel in Samaria. He ruled for six months. This was during Azariah’s thirty-eighth year as king of Judah.
2 Kings,15,9,Zechariah did what the Lord said was wrong. He did just as his ancestors had done. Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused the people of Israel to sin. And Zechariah did not stop doing the same sins.
2 Kings,15,10,Shallum son of Jabesh made plans against Zechariah. He killed Zechariah in Ibleam. And Shallum became king in Zechariah’s place.
2 Kings,15,11,The other acts of Zechariah are written down. They are in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,15,12,Now the Lord had told Jehu: “Your sons down to your great-great-grandchildren will be kings of Israel.” And the Lord’s word came true.
2 Kings,15,13,Then Shallum son of Jabesh became king. This was during Uzziah’s thirty-ninth year as king of Judah. Shallum ruled for a month in Samaria.
2 Kings,15,14,Then Menahem son of Gadi came up from Tirzah to Samaria. He attacked Shallum son of Jabesh in Samaria. He killed him and became king in Shallum’s place.
2 Kings,15,15,The other acts of Shallum and his secret plans are written down. They are in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,15,16,Menahem started out from Tirzah and attacked Tiphsah. He destroyed the city and the area nearby. This was because the people had refused to open the city gate for him. So he defeated them and ripped open all their pregnant women.
2 Kings,15,17,Menahem son of Gadi became king over Israel. This was during Azariah’s thirty-ninth year as king of Judah. And Menahem ruled ten years in Samaria.
2 Kings,15,18,"He did what the Lord said was wrong. Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to sin. And all the time Menahem was king, he did not stop doing the same sins."
2 Kings,15,19,"Pul king of Assyria came to attack the land. Menahem gave him about 74,000 pounds of silver. This was so Pul would support Menahem and make his hold on the kingdom stronger."
2 Kings,15,20,Menahem raised the money by taxing all the rich men of Israel. He taxed each man about 1¼ pounds of silver. Then he gave the money to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria left and did not stay in the land.
2 Kings,15,21,Everything else Menahem did is written down. It is in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,15,22,Then Menahem died. And his son Pekahiah became king in his place.
2 Kings,15,23,Pekahiah son of Menahem became king over Israel in Samaria. This was during Azariah’s fiftieth year as king of Judah. Pekahiah ruled two years.
2 Kings,15,24,He did what the Lord said was wrong. Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to sin. And Pekahiah did not stop doing the same sins.
2 Kings,15,25,"Pekah son of Remaliah was one of Pekahiah’s captains. He made plans against Pekahiah. He took 50 men of Gilead with him and killed Pekahiah. They killed him, Argob and Arieh in the palace at Samaria. Then Pekah became king in Pekahiah’s place."
2 Kings,15,26,Everything else Pekahiah did is written down. It is in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,15,27,Pekah son of Remaliah became king over Israel in Samaria. This was during Azariah’s fifty-second year as king of Judah. And Pekah ruled 20 years.
2 Kings,15,28,He did what the Lord said was wrong. Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to sin. And Pekah did not stop doing the same sins.
2 Kings,15,29,"Tiglath-Pileser, also called Pul, was king of Assyria. He attacked while Pekah was king of Israel. Tiglath-Pileser captured the cities of Ijon, Abel Beth Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh and Hazor. He also captured Gilead and Galilee. And he captured all the land of Naphtali. He sent the people from these places away to Assyria."
2 Kings,15,30,Then Hoshea son of Elah made plans against Pekah son of Remaliah. Hoshea attacked and killed Pekah. Then he became king in Pekah’s place. This was during the twentieth year Jotham son of Uzziah was king.
2 Kings,15,31,Everything else Pekah did is written down. It is in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings,15,32,Then Jotham son of Uzziah became king of Judah. This was during the second year Pekah son of Remaliah was king of Israel.
2 Kings,15,33,Jotham was 25 years old when he became king. He ruled 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok.
2 Kings,15,34,Jotham did what the Lord said was right. He obeyed God just as his father Uzziah had done.
2 Kings,15,35,But the places where false gods were worshiped were not removed. And the people still made sacrifices and burned incense there. Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings,15,36,The other things Jotham did while he was king are written down. They are in the book of the history of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,15,37,At that time the Lord began to send Rezin king of Aram against Judah. He also sent Pekah son of Remaliah against them.
2 Kings,15,38,"Jotham died and was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem. It was the city of David, his ancestor. And Jotham’s son Ahaz became king in his place."
2 Kings,16,1,Ahaz was the son of Jotham king of Judah. Ahaz became king of Judah in the seventeenth year Pekah was king of Israel. Pekah was the son of Remaliah.
2 Kings,16,2,Ahaz was 20 years old when he became king. He ruled 16 years in Jerusalem. He was not like his ancestor David. He did not do what the Lord his God said was right.
2 Kings,16,3,Ahaz did the same things the kings of Israel had done. He even sacrificed his sons by burning them in the fire. He did the same hated sins as the other nations had done. And the Lord had forced these nations out of the land ahead of the Israelites.
2 Kings,16,4,Ahaz offered sacrifices and burned incense at the places where false gods were worshiped. And he did this on the hills and under every green tree.
2 Kings,16,5,Rezin king of Aram and Pekah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to attack it. (Pekah was the son of Remaliah.) They surrounded Ahaz but could not defeat him.
2 Kings,16,6,At that time Rezin king of Aram took back the city of Elath for Aram. He forced out all the people of Judah. Then Edomites moved into Elath. And they still live there today.
2 Kings,16,7,"Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria. Ahaz said, “I am your servant. Come and save me from the king of Aram and the king of Israel. They are attacking me.”"
2 Kings,16,8,Ahaz took the silver and gold that was in the Temple of the Lord. He also took the treasuries of the palace. He sent these as a gift to the king of Assyria.
2 Kings,16,9,So the king of Assyria listened to Ahaz. He attacked Damascus and captured it. Then he sent all the people of Damascus to Kir. And he killed Rezin.
2 Kings,16,10,Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria. Ahaz saw an altar at Damascus. He sent plans and a pattern of this altar to Uriah the priest.
2 Kings,16,11,So Uriah the priest built an altar. It was just like the plans King Ahaz had sent him from Damascus. Uriah finished the altar before King Ahaz came back from Damascus.
2 Kings,16,12,"When the king arrived from Damascus, he saw the altar. He went near and offered sacrifices on it."
2 Kings,16,13,He burned his burnt offerings and grain offerings. He poured out his drink offering. He also sprinkled the blood of his fellowship offerings on the altar.
2 Kings,16,14,Ahaz moved the bronze altar that was before the Lord at the front of the Temple. It was between Ahaz’s altar and the Temple of the Lord. He put it on the north side of his altar.
2 Kings,16,15,"King Ahaz gave a command to Uriah the priest. Ahaz said, “Burn the morning burnt offering and the evening grain offering on the large altar. Also offer the king’s burnt offering and his grain offering. Offer the whole burnt offering for all the people of the land. And offer their grain offering and drink offering. Sprinkle on the altar all the blood of the burnt offering and of the sacrifice. But I will use the bronze altar to ask questions of God.”"
2 Kings,16,16,Uriah the priest did everything King Ahaz commanded him to do.
2 Kings,16,17,"Then King Ahaz took off the side panels from the bases. He took the washing bowls off the top of the bases. He also took the large bowl, which was called the Sea, off the bronze bulls that held it up. And he put it on a stone base."
2 Kings,16,18,Ahaz took away the platform for the royal throne. It had been built at the Temple. He also took away the outside entrance for the king. He did these things because of the king of Assyria.
2 Kings,16,19,The other things Ahaz did as king are written down. They are in the book of the history of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,16,20,Ahaz died and was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem. Ahaz’s son Hezekiah became king in his place.
2 Kings,17,1,Hoshea son of Elah became king over Israel. This was during Ahaz’s twelfth year as king of Judah. Hoshea ruled in Samaria nine years.
2 Kings,17,2,He did what the Lord said was wrong. But he was not as bad as the kings of Israel who had ruled before him.
2 Kings,17,3,Shalmaneser king of Assyria came to attack Hoshea. Hoshea had been Shalmaneser’s servant. He had made the payments to Shalmaneser that he had demanded.
2 Kings,17,4,"But the king of Assyria found out that Hoshea had made plans against him. Hoshea had sent messengers to So, the king of Egypt. And Hoshea had quit giving Shalmaneser the payments he demanded. In the past Hoshea had paid him every year. So the king put Hoshea in prison."
2 Kings,17,5,Then the king of Assyria came and attacked all the land of Israel. He surrounded Samaria and attacked it for three years.
2 Kings,17,6,He defeated Samaria in the ninth year Hoshea was king. He took the Israelites away to Assyria. He settled some of them in Halah. Some were made to settle in Gozan on the Habor River. Others were settled in the cities of the Medes.
2 Kings,17,7,All these things happened because the Israelites had sinned against the Lord their God. He had brought them out of Egypt. He had rescued them from the power of the king of Egypt. But the Israelites had honored other gods.
2 Kings,17,8,They lived like the nations the Lord had forced out of the land ahead of them. They also lived as the evil kings had shown them.
2 Kings,17,9,"They secretly sinned against the Lord their God. They built places in all their cities where false gods were worshiped. They built them everywhere from the watchtower to the strong, walled city."
2 Kings,17,10,They put up stone pillars for worshiping false gods. And they put up Asherah idols on every high hill and under every green tree.
2 Kings,17,11,The Israelites burned incense everywhere false gods were worshiped. The nations who lived there before them had done this. And the Lord had forced them out of the land. The Israelites did wicked things that made the Lord angry.
2 Kings,17,12,"They served idols. And the Lord had said, “You must not do this.”"
2 Kings,17,13,"The Lord used every prophet and seer to warn Israel and Judah. He said, “Stop your evil ways. Obey my commands and laws. Follow all the teachings that I commanded your ancestors to obey. I sent you this law through my servants the prophets.”"
2 Kings,17,14,"But the people would not listen. They were stubborn, just as their ancestors had been. Their ancestors did not believe in the Lord their God."
2 Kings,17,15,They rejected the Lord’s laws and the agreement he had made with their ancestors. And they refused to listen to his warnings. They worshiped useless idols and became useless themselves. They did what the nations around them did. And the Lord had warned them not to do this.
2 Kings,17,16,The people disobeyed all the commands of the Lord their God. They made statues of two calves from melted metal. And they made an Asherah idol. They worshiped all the stars of heaven and served Baal.
2 Kings,17,17,They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire. And they tried to find out the future by magic and witchcraft. They always chose to do what the Lord said was wrong. And this made him angry.
2 Kings,17,18,So he was very angry with the people of Israel. He removed them from his presence. Only the tribe of Judah was left.
2 Kings,17,19,But even Judah did not obey the commands of the Lord their God. They did what the Israelites had done.
2 Kings,17,20,So the Lord rejected all the people of Israel. He punished them and let people destroy them. He threw them out of his presence.
2 Kings,17,21,The Lord separated them from the family of David. And the Israelites made Jeroboam son of Nebat their king. Jeroboam led the Israelites away from following the Lord. He caused them to sin greatly.
2 Kings,17,22,So they continued to do all the sins Jeroboam did. They did not stop doing these sins
2 Kings,17,23,until the Lord removed the people from his presence. This was just as he had said he would do. He had said this through all his servants the prophets. So the Israelites were taken out of their land to Assyria. And they have been there to this day.
2 Kings,17,24,"The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath and Sepharvaim. He put them in the cities of Samaria to replace the Israelites. These people took over Samaria and lived in the cities."
2 Kings,17,25,At first they did not worship the Lord. So he sent lions among them. The lions killed some of them.
2 Kings,17,26,"The king of Assyria was told this. It was said, “You sent foreigners into the cities of Samaria. They do not know the law of the god of the land. This is why that land’s god has sent lions among them. The lions are killing them because they don’t know what the god wants.”"
2 Kings,17,27,"Then the king of Assyria gave a command. He said, “You took Samaria’s priests away. Send back one of the priests to live there. Let him teach them what the god wants.”"
2 Kings,17,28,So one of the priests who had been carried away from Samaria returned. He came to live in Bethel. And he taught the people how to worship the Lord.
2 Kings,17,29,But each nation made gods of its own. They put them in the cities where they lived. They put them in the temples where false gods were worshiped. These temples had been made by the Samaritans.
2 Kings,17,30,The men from Babylon made Succoth Benoth their god. The men from Cuthah worshiped Nergal. The men of Hamath worshiped Ashima.
2 Kings,17,31,"The Avvites worshiped Nibhaz and Tartak. And the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire. They sacrificed them to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim."
2 Kings,17,32,They also worshiped the Lord. But they chose priests for the places where false gods were worshiped. The priests were chosen from among themselves. And they made sacrifices for the people.
2 Kings,17,33,The people worshiped the Lord but also served their own gods. They served their gods as the nations did from which they had been brought.
2 Kings,17,34,"Even today they do as they did in the past. They do not worship the Lord. They do not obey his rules and commands. They do not obey the teachings or the commands of the Lord. He gave these commands to the children of Jacob, whom the Lord had named Israel."
2 Kings,17,35,"The Lord had made an agreement with them. He had commanded them, “Do not worship other gods. Do not bow down to them or serve them. Do not give sacrifices to them."
2 Kings,17,36,Worship the Lord who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. He did it with great power and strength. Bow to the Lord and make sacrifices to him.
2 Kings,17,37,"Obey the rules, orders and the teachings. Obey the commands the Lord wrote for you. Obey and always do them. Do not worship other gods."
2 Kings,17,38,Do not forget the agreement I made with you. And do not worship other gods.
2 Kings,17,39,Instead worship the Lord your God. He will save you from all your enemies.”
2 Kings,17,40,But the Israelites did not listen. They kept on doing the same things they had done before.
2 Kings,17,41,So these nations worshiped the Lord but served their idols. And their children and grandchildren still do as their ancestors did.
2 Kings,18,1,Hezekiah son of Ahaz king of Judah became king. This was during the third year Hoshea son of Elah was king of Israel.
2 Kings,18,2,Hezekiah was 25 years old when he became king. And he ruled 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah.
2 Kings,18,3,Hezekiah did what the Lord said was right. He did just as his ancestor David had done.
2 Kings,18,4,He removed the places where false gods were worshiped. He broke the stone pillars they worshiped. He cut down the Asherah idols. Also the Israelites had been burning incense to the bronze snake made by Moses. (It was called Nehushtan.) But Hezekiah broke it into pieces.
2 Kings,18,5,"Hezekiah trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah. There was no king like him, before him or after him."
2 Kings,18,6,Hezekiah was loyal to the Lord. He did not stop following the Lord. He obeyed the commands the Lord had given Moses.
2 Kings,18,7,And the Lord was with Hezekiah. He had success in everything he did. He turned against the king of Assyria and stopped serving him.
2 Kings,18,8,"Hezekiah defeated the Philistines all the way to Gaza and its borders. He defeated them everywhere, from the watchtower to the strong, walled city."
2 Kings,18,9,Shalmaneser king of Assyria surrounded Samaria and attacked it. This was in the fourth year Hezekiah was king. And it was the seventh year Hoshea son of Elah was king of Israel.
2 Kings,18,10,After three years the Assyrians captured Samaria. This was in the sixth year Hezekiah was king. And it was Hoshea’s ninth year as king of Israel.
2 Kings,18,11,The king of Assyria took the Israelites away to Assyria. He put them in Halah and in Gozan on the Habor River. He also put them in the cities of the Medes.
2 Kings,18,12,"This happened because they did not obey the Lord their God. They broke his agreement. They did not obey all that Moses, the Lord’s servant, had commanded. They would not listen to the commands or do them."
2 Kings,18,13,"During Hezekiah’s fourteenth year as king, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked Judah. He attacked all the strong, walled cities of Judah and defeated them."
2 Kings,18,14,"Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent a message to the king of Assyria at Lachish. He said, “I have done wrong. Leave me alone. Then I will pay anything you demand of me.” So the king of Assyria told Hezekiah how much to pay. It was about 22,000 pounds of silver and 2,000 pounds of gold."
2 Kings,18,15,Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was in the Temple of the Lord. And he gave him all the silver in the palace treasuries.
2 Kings,18,16,Hezekiah cut off all the gold that covered the doors of the Temple of the Lord. He also removed the gold from the doorposts. Hezekiah had put gold on these doors himself. He gave it all to the king of Assyria.
2 Kings,18,17,"The king of Assyria sent out his supreme commander, his chief officer and his field commander. They went with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. When they came near the waterway from the upper pool, they stopped. The upper pool is on the road to the Washerman’s Field."
2 Kings,18,18,"They called for the king. So Eliakim, Shebna and Joah went out to meet them. Eliakim son of Hilkiah was the palace manager. Shebna was the royal assistant. And Joah son of Asaph was the recorder."
2 Kings,18,19,"The field commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah this: “‘The great king, the king of Assyria, says: You have nothing to trust in to help you."
2 Kings,18,20,You say you have battle plans and power for war. But your words mean nothing. Whom are you trusting for help so that you turn against me?
2 Kings,18,21,"Look, you are depending on Egypt to help you. Egypt is like a splintered walking stick. If you lean on it for help, it will stab you and hurt you. The king of Egypt will hurt those who depend on him."
2 Kings,18,22,"You might say, “We are depending on the Lord our God.” But Hezekiah destroyed the Lord’s altars and the places of worship. Hezekiah told Judah and Jerusalem, “You must worship only at this one altar in Jerusalem.”"
2 Kings,18,23,"“‘Now make an agreement with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you 2,000 horses if you can find enough men to ride them."
2 Kings,18,24,You cannot defeat one of my master’s least important officers. So why do you depend on Egypt to give you chariots and horsemen?
2 Kings,18,25,I have not come to attack and destroy this place without an order from the Lord. The Lord himself told me to come to this country and destroy it.’”
2 Kings,18,26,"Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna and Joah spoke to the field commander. They said, “Please speak to us in the Aramaic language. We understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew because the people on the city wall can hear you.”"
2 Kings,18,27,"But the commander said, “No. My master did not send me to tell these things only to you and your king. My master sent me to tell them also to those people sitting on the wall. They will have to eat their own dung and drink their own urine like you.”"
2 Kings,18,28,"Then the commander stood and shouted loudly in the Hebrew language. He said, “Listen to the word from the great king, the king of Assyria!"
2 Kings,18,29,The king says you should not let Hezekiah fool you. Hezekiah can’t save you from my power.
2 Kings,18,30,"Don’t let Hezekiah talk you into trusting the Lord. Hezekiah says, ‘The Lord will surely save us. This city won’t be given over to the king of Assyria.’"
2 Kings,18,31,"“Don’t listen to Hezekiah. The king of Assyria says, ‘Make peace with me. Come out of the city to me. Then everyone will be free to eat the fruit from his own grapevine and fig tree. Everyone will be free to drink water from his own well."
2 Kings,18,32,"Then I will come and take you to a land like your own. It is a land with grain and new wine. It has bread and vineyards. It is a land of olives and honey. Then you can choose to live and not to die!’ “Don’t listen to Hezekiah. He is fooling you when he says, ‘The Lord will save us.’"
2 Kings,18,33,The god of any other nation has not saved his people from the power of the king of Assyria.
2 Kings,18,34,"Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? They did not save Samaria from my power."
2 Kings,18,35,Not one of all the gods of these countries has saved his people from me. Then the Lord cannot save Jerusalem from my power.”
2 Kings,18,36,"The people were silent. They didn’t answer the commander at all. This was because King Hezekiah had ordered, “Don’t answer him.”"
2 Kings,18,37,"Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah tore their clothes to show how upset they were. (Eliakim son of Hilkiah was the palace manager. Shebna was the royal assistant. And Joah son of Asaph was the recorder.) The three men went to Hezekiah and told him what the field commander had said."
2 Kings,19,1,"When King Hezekiah heard the message, he tore his clothes. And he put on rough cloth to show how sad he was. Then he went into the Temple of the Lord."
2 Kings,19,2,"Hezekiah sent Eliakim, Shebna and the older priests to Isaiah. Eliakim was the palace manager, and Shebna was the royal assistant. The men were all wearing the rough cloth when they came to Isaiah. He was a prophet, the son of Amoz."
2 Kings,19,3,"These men told Isaiah, “This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day of sorrow and punishment and disgrace. It is sad, as when a child should be born, but the mother is not strong enough to give birth to it."
2 Kings,19,4,The king of Assyria sent his field commander to make fun of the living God. Maybe the Lord your God will hear what the commander said. Maybe the Lord your God will punish him for what he said. So pray for the few people of Israel who are left alive.”
2 Kings,19,5,"When Hezekiah’s officers came to Isaiah,"
2 Kings,19,6,"he said to them, “Tell your master this: The Lord says, ‘Don’t be afraid of what you have heard. Don’t be frightened by the words the servants of the king of Assyria said against me."
2 Kings,19,7,Listen! I am going to put a spirit in the king of Assyria. He will hear a report that will make him return to his own country. And I will cause him to die by the sword there.’”
2 Kings,19,8,The field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish. So the commander left and found the king fighting against the city of Libnah.
2 Kings,19,9,"The king received a report that Tirhakah was coming to attack him. Tirhakah was the Cushite king of Egypt. When the king of Assyria heard this, he sent messengers to Hezekiah. The king said:"
2 Kings,19,10,“Say this to Hezekiah king of Judah: Don’t be fooled by the god you trust. Don’t believe him when he says Jerusalem will not be defeated by the king of Assyria.
2 Kings,19,11,You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done. They have completely defeated every country. Do not think you will be saved.
2 Kings,19,12,"The gods of those people did not save them. My ancestors destroyed them. My ancestors defeated the cities of Gozan, Haran and Rezeph. They defeated the people of Eden living in Tel Assar."
2 Kings,19,13,Where are the kings of Hamath and Arpad? Where is the king of the city of Sepharvaim? Where are the kings of Hena and Ivvah?”
2 Kings,19,14,Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the Temple of the Lord. Hezekiah spread the letter out before the Lord.
2 Kings,19,15,"And he prayed to the Lord: “Lord, God of Israel, your throne is between the gold creatures with wings! Only you are God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You made the heavens and the earth."
2 Kings,19,16,"Hear, Lord, and listen. Open your eyes, Lord, and see. Listen to the word Sennacherib has said to insult the living God."
2 Kings,19,17,"It is true, Lord. The kings of Assyria have destroyed these countries and their lands."
2 Kings,19,18,These kings have thrown the gods of these nations into the fire. But they were only wood and rock statues that men made. So the kings have destroyed them.
2 Kings,19,19,"Now, Lord our God, save us from the king’s power. Then all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you, Lord, are the only God.”"
2 Kings,19,20,"Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah. Isaiah said, “The Lord, the God of Israel, says this: I have heard your prayer to me about Sennacherib king of Assyria."
2 Kings,19,21,So this is what the Lord has said against Sennacherib: ‘The people of Jerusalem hate you and make fun of you. The people of Jerusalem laugh at you as you run away.
2 Kings,19,22,"You have insulted me and spoken against me. You have raised your voice against me. You have a proud look on your face. You disobey me, the Holy One of Israel!"
2 Kings,19,23,"You have used your messengers to insult the Lord. You have said, “I have many chariots. With them I have gone to the tops of the mountains. I have climbed the highest mountains of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars. I have cut down its best pine trees. I have reached its farthest places. I have gone to its best forests."
2 Kings,19,24,"I have dug wells in foreign countries. I have drunk water there. By the soles of my feet, I have dried up all the rivers of Egypt.”"
2 Kings,19,25,"“‘King of Assyria, surely you have heard. Long ago I, the Lord, planned these things. Long ago I planned them. Now I have made them happen. I allowed you to turn those strong, walled cities into piles of rocks."
2 Kings,19,26,"The people living in those cities were weak. They were frightened and put to shame. They were like grass in the field. They were like tender, young grass. They were like grass that grows on the housetop. It is burned by the wind before it can grow."
2 Kings,19,27,“‘I know when you rest and when you come and go. I know how you speak against me.
2 Kings,19,28,You speak strongly against me. And I have heard your proud words. So I will put my hook in your nose. And I will put my bit in your mouth. Then I will force you to leave my country the same way that you came.’
2 Kings,19,29,"“Then the Lord said, ‘Hezekiah, I will give you this sign: This year you will eat the grain that grows wild. And the second year you will eat what grows wild from that. But in the third year, plant grain and harvest it. Plant vineyards and eat their fruit."
2 Kings,19,30,"Some of the people in the family of Judah will be saved. Like plants that take root, they will grow strong and have many children."
2 Kings,19,31,A few people will come out of Jerusalem alive. There will be a few from Mount Zion who will live. The strong love of the Lord of heaven’s armies will cause this to happen.’
2 Kings,19,32,“So this is what the Lord says about the king of Assyria: ‘He will not enter this city. He will not even shoot an arrow here. He will not fight against it with shields. He will not build a ramp to attack the city walls.
2 Kings,19,33,"He will return to his country the same way he came. He will not enter this city,’ says the Lord."
2 Kings,19,34,"The Lord says, ‘I will defend and save this city. I will do this for myself and for David, my servant.’”"
2 Kings,19,35,"That night the angel of the Lord went out. He killed 185,000 men in the Assyrian camp. The people got up early the next morning. And they saw all the dead bodies!"
2 Kings,19,36,So Sennacherib king of Assyria left. He went back to Nineveh and stayed there.
2 Kings,19,37,"One day Sennacherib was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch. While he was there, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with a sword. Then they escaped to the land of Ararat. So Sennacherib’s son Esarhaddon became king of Assyria."
2 Kings,20,1,"At that time Hezekiah became very sick. He was almost dead. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to see him. Isaiah told him, “This is what the Lord says: You are going to die. So you should give your last orders to everyone. You will not get well.”"
2 Kings,20,2,"Hezekiah turned toward the wall and prayed to the Lord. He said,"
2 Kings,20,3,"“Lord, please remember that I have always obeyed you. I have given myself completely to you. I have done what you said was right.” And Hezekiah cried loudly."
2 Kings,20,4,"Before Isaiah had left the middle courtyard, the Lord spoke his word to Isaiah:"
2 Kings,20,5,"“Go back and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people: ‘This is what the Lord, the God of your ancestor David, says: I have heard your prayer. And I have seen your tears. So I will heal you. Three days from now you will go up to the Temple of the Lord."
2 Kings,20,6,I will add 15 years to your life. I will save you and this city from the king of Assyria. And I will protect the city for myself and for my servant David.’”
2 Kings,20,7,"Then Isaiah said, “Make a paste from figs.” So they made it and put it on Hezekiah’s boil. And he got well."
2 Kings,20,8,"Hezekiah asked Isaiah, “What will be the sign that the Lord will heal me? What is the sign that I will go up to the Temple of the Lord on the third day?”"
2 Kings,20,9,"Isaiah said, “The Lord will do what he says. This is the sign from the Lord to show you: Do you want the shadow to go forward ten steps? Or do you want it to go back ten steps?”"
2 Kings,20,10,"Hezekiah answered, “It’s easy for the shadow to go forward ten steps. Instead, let it go back ten steps.”"
2 Kings,20,11,Then Isaiah the prophet called to the Lord. And the Lord brought the shadow back ten steps. It went back up the stairway of Ahaz that it had gone down.
2 Kings,20,12,"At that time Merodach-Baladan, son of Baladan, was king of Babylon. He sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah. He did this because he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick."
2 Kings,20,13,"Hezekiah was happy to see the messengers. So he showed them what was in his storehouses: the silver, gold, spices and expensive perfumes. He showed them his swords and shields. He showed them all his wealth. He showed them everything in his palace and his kingdom."
2 Kings,20,14,"Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah. Isaiah asked him, “What did these men say? Where did they come from?” Hezekiah said, “They came from a faraway country. They came to me from Babylon.”"
2 Kings,20,15,"So Isaiah asked him, “What did they see in your palace?” Hezekiah said, “They saw everything in my palace. I showed them all my wealth.”"
2 Kings,20,16,"Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to the words of the Lord:"
2 Kings,20,17,"‘In the future everything in your palace will be taken away to Babylon. Everything your ancestors have stored up until this day will be taken away. Nothing will be left,’ says the Lord."
2 Kings,20,18,‘Some of your own children will be taken away. Those who will be born to you will be taken away. And they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”
2 Kings,20,19,"Hezekiah told Isaiah, “These words from the Lord are good.” He said this because he thought, “There will be peace and security while I am king.”"
2 Kings,20,20,Everything else Hezekiah did is written down. All his victories and his work on the pool are written down. And his work on the tunnel to bring water into the city is recorded. They are all written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,20,21,Then Hezekiah died. And his son Manasseh became king in his place.
2 Kings,21,1,Manasseh was 12 years old when he became king. And he was king 55 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hephzibah.
2 Kings,21,2,He did what the Lord said was wrong. He did the hated things the other nations had done. And the Lord had forced these nations out of the land ahead of the Israelites.
2 Kings,21,3,"Manasseh’s father, Hezekiah, had destroyed the places where false gods were worshiped. But Manasseh rebuilt them. He built altars for Baal. And he made an Asherah idol as Ahab king of Israel had done. Manasseh worshiped all the stars of heaven and served them."
2 Kings,21,4,"The Lord had said about the Temple, “I will be worshiped in Jerusalem.” But Manasseh built altars in the Temple of the Lord."
2 Kings,21,5,He built altars to worship the stars in the two courtyards of the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings,21,6,He burned his own son as a sacrifice. He practiced magic and told the future by explaining signs and dreams. He got advice from mediums and fortune-tellers. He did many things that the Lord said were wrong. And this made the Lord angry.
2 Kings,21,7,"Manasseh carved an Asherah idol and put it in the Temple. The Lord had spoken to David and his son Solomon about the Temple. He had said, “I will be worshiped in this Temple and in Jerusalem forever. I have chosen Jerusalem from all the tribes of Israel."
2 Kings,21,8,I will never again make the Israelites wander out of the land I gave their ancestors. But they must obey everything I have commanded them. And they must obey all the teachings my servant Moses gave them.”
2 Kings,21,9,But the people did not listen. Manasseh led them to do wrong. They did more evil than the nations the Lord had destroyed ahead of the Israelites.
2 Kings,21,10,"The Lord spoke through his servants the prophets. He said,"
2 Kings,21,11,“Manasseh king of Judah has done these hated things. He has done more evil than the Amorites before him. Manasseh also has caused Judah to sin with his idols.
2 Kings,21,12,"So this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘I will bring much trouble on Jerusalem and Judah. Anyone who hears about it will be shocked."
2 Kings,21,13,I will stretch the measuring line of Samaria over Jerusalem. And the plumb line used against Ahab’s family will be used on Jerusalem. I will wipe out Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish. He wipes it and turns it upside down.
2 Kings,21,14,I will go away from the rest of my people who are left. I will give them to their enemies. They will be robbed by all their enemies.
2 Kings,21,15,My people did what I said was wrong. They have made me angry from the day their ancestors left Egypt until now.’”
2 Kings,21,16,Manasseh also killed many innocent people. He filled Jerusalem from one end to the other with their blood. This was besides the sin he caused Judah to do. He caused Judah to do what the Lord said was wrong.
2 Kings,21,17,"The other things Manasseh did as king are written down, even the sin he did. They are in the book of the history of the kings of Judah."
2 Kings,21,18,Manasseh died and was buried in the garden of his own palace. It is the garden of Uzza. Then Manasseh’s son Amon became king in his place.
2 Kings,21,19,Amon was 22 years old when he became king. He was king for two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz. She was from Jotbah.
2 Kings,21,20,Amon did what the Lord said was wrong. He did as his father Manasseh had done.
2 Kings,21,21,Amon lived in the same way his father had lived. He worshiped the idols his father had worshiped. And he bowed down before them.
2 Kings,21,22,"Amon rejected the Lord, the God of his ancestors. He did not follow the ways of the Lord."
2 Kings,21,23,Amon’s officers made plans against him and killed him in his palace.
2 Kings,21,24,Then the people of Judah killed all those who had made plans to kill King Amon. And they made his son Josiah king in his place.
2 Kings,21,25,Everything else Amon did is written down. It is in the book of the history of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,21,26,He was buried in his grave in the garden of Uzza. And his son Josiah became king in his place.
2 Kings,22,1,Josiah was eight years old when he became king. He ruled 31 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah. Adaiah was from Bozkath.
2 Kings,22,2,Josiah did what the Lord said was right. He did good things as his ancestor David had done. Josiah did not stop doing what was right.
2 Kings,22,3,"In Josiah’s eighteenth year as king, he sent Shaphan to the Temple of the Lord. Shaphan was the son of Azaliah, who was the son of Meshullam. Shaphan was the royal assistant. Josiah said,"
2 Kings,22,4,“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest. Have him empty out the money the gatekeepers have gathered from the people. This is the money they have brought into the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings,22,5,Have him give the money to the supervisors of the work on the Temple. They must pay the men who work to repair the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings,22,6,"The workers are carpenters, builders and stoneworkers. Also use the money to buy timber and cut stone to repair the Temple."
2 Kings,22,7,They do not need to report how they use the money given to them. They are working honestly.”
2 Kings,22,8,"Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the royal assistant, “I’ve found the Book of the Teachings. It was in the Temple of the Lord.” He gave it to Shaphan, who read it."
2 Kings,22,9,"Then Shaphan the royal assistant went to the king and reported to Josiah, “Your officers have paid out the money that was in the Temple of the Lord. They have given it to the workers and supervisors at the Temple.”"
2 Kings,22,10,"Then Shaphan the royal assistant told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read from the book to the king."
2 Kings,22,11,The king heard the words of the Book of the Teachings. Then he tore his clothes to show how upset he was.
2 Kings,22,12,"He gave these orders to Hilkiah the priest and Ahikam son of Shaphan. He also gave them to Acbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan and Asaiah. Shaphan was the royal assistant. And Asaiah was the king’s servant. These were the orders:"
2 Kings,22,13,“Go and ask the Lord about the words in the book that has been found. Ask for me and for all the people and for all Judah. The Lord’s anger is burning against us because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book. They did not do all the things written for us to do!”
2 Kings,22,14,"So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Acbor, Shaphan and Asaiah left. They went to talk to Huldah the prophetess. She was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas. Harhas took care of the king’s clothes. Huldah lived in Jerusalem, in the new area of the city."
2 Kings,22,15,"She said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Tell the man who sent you to me,"
2 Kings,22,16,‘This is what the Lord says: I will bring trouble to this place and to the people living here. It is in the words of the book which the king of Judah has read.
2 Kings,22,17,The people of Judah have left me. They have burned incense to other gods. They have made me angry by all the idols they have made. My anger burns against this place like a fire. It will not be put out.’
2 Kings,22,18,"Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to ask the Lord, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says about the words you heard:"
2 Kings,22,19,"You heard my words against this place and its people. You became sorry in the Lord’s presence for what you had done. I said they would become cursed and would be destroyed. Then you tore your clothes to show how upset you were. And you cried in my presence. This is why I have heard you, says the Lord."
2 Kings,22,20,So I will cause you to die. You will be buried in peace. You won’t see all the trouble I will bring to this place.’” So they took her message back to the king.
2 Kings,23,1,Then the king gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem together.
2 Kings,23,2,"He went up to the Temple of the Lord. All the men from Judah and Jerusalem went with him. The priests, prophets and all the people—from the least important to the most important—went with him. He read to them all the words of the Book of the Agreement. That book was found in the Temple of the Lord."
2 Kings,23,3,"The king stood by the pillar. He made an agreement in the presence of the Lord. He agreed to follow the Lord and obey his commands, rules and laws with his whole being. He agreed to do what was written in this book. Then all the people promised to obey the agreement."
2 Kings,23,4,"The king gave a command to Hilkiah the high priest. He also gave it to the priests of the next rank and the gatekeepers. He told them to bring out of the Temple of the Lord everything made for Baal, Asherah and all the stars of heaven. Then Josiah burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron Valley. And he carried the ashes to Bethel."
2 Kings,23,5,"The kings of Judah had chosen priests for these gods. These priests burned incense on the places where false gods were worshiped. These places were in the cities of Judah and the towns around Jerusalem. The priests burned incense to Baal, the sun and the moon. And they burned incense to the planets and all the stars of heaven. But Josiah took those priests away."
2 Kings,23,6,He removed the Asherah idol from the Temple of the Lord. He took it outside Jerusalem to the Kidron Valley. There he burned it and beat it into dust. And he threw the dust on the graves of the common people.
2 Kings,23,7,Then he tore down the houses of the male prostitutes who were in the Temple of the Lord. This was where the women did weaving for Asherah.
2 Kings,23,8,"King Josiah brought all the false priests from the cities of Judah. He made the places where false gods were worshiped impure. This is where the priests had burned incense. These places of worship were everywhere, from Geba to Beersheba. He destroyed the places of worship at the entrance to the Gate of Joshua. (Joshua was the ruler of the city.) This gate was on the left side of the city gate."
2 Kings,23,9,The priests at the places where false gods were worshiped were not allowed to serve at the Lord’s altar in Jerusalem. But they could eat bread made without yeast with their brothers.
2 Kings,23,10,Topheth was in the Valley of Ben Hinnom. Josiah made it impure so no one could sacrifice his son or daughter to Molech.
2 Kings,23,11,"Judah’s kings had placed horses at the front door of the Temple of the Lord. This was in the courtyard near the room of Nathan-Melech, an officer. These horses were for the worship of the sun. But Josiah removed them. Then he burned the chariots that were for sun worship."
2 Kings,23,12,The kings of Judah had also built altars on the roof of the upstairs room of Ahaz. Josiah broke down these altars. He also broke down the altars Manasseh had made. These were in the two courtyards of the Temple of the Lord. He smashed them to pieces. Then he threw their dust into the Kidron Valley.
2 Kings,23,13,"King Josiah made impure the places east of Jerusalem where false gods were worshiped. These were south of the Mount of Olives. Solomon king of Israel had built these places. One was for Ashtoreth, the hated goddess of the Sidonians. One was for Chemosh, the hated god of Moab. And one was for Molech, the hated god of the Ammonites."
2 Kings,23,14,Josiah smashed into pieces the stone pillars they worshiped. He cut down the Asherah idols. And he covered the places with human bones.
2 Kings,23,15,Josiah also broke down the altar at Bethel. This was the place of worship Jeroboam son of Nebat had made. Jeroboam had caused Israel to sin. Josiah burned that place. He broke the stones of the altar to pieces. Then he beat them into dust. And he burned the Asherah idol.
2 Kings,23,16,"When he turned around, he saw the graves on the mountain. He had the bones taken from the graves. Then he burned the bones on the altar to make it impure. This happened as the Lord had said it would through the man of God."
2 Kings,23,17,"Josiah asked, “What is that monument to the dead I see?” The people of the city answered, “It’s the grave of the man of God who came from Judah. This prophet announced the things you have done against the altar of Bethel.”"
2 Kings,23,18,"Josiah said, “Leave the grave alone. No person may move this man’s bones.” So they left his bones. And they left the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria."
2 Kings,23,19,The kings of Israel had built temples for worshiping false gods in the cities of Samaria. That had caused the Lord to be angry. Josiah removed all those temples. He did the same things as he had done at Bethel.
2 Kings,23,20,Josiah killed all the priests of those places of worship. He killed them on the altars. And he burned human bones on the altars. Then he went back to Jerusalem.
2 Kings,23,21,"The king gave a command to all the people. He said, “Celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God. Do it as it is written in this Book of the Agreement.”"
2 Kings,23,22,No Passover like this one had been celebrated since the judges led Israel. Nor had one like it happened while there were kings of Israel and kings of Judah.
2 Kings,23,23,This Passover was celebrated to the Lord in Jerusalem. It was the eighteenth year of King Josiah’s rule.
2 Kings,23,24,"Josiah destroyed the mediums, fortune-tellers, house gods and idols. He destroyed all the hated gods seen in the land of Judah and Jerusalem. He did this to obey the words of the teachings. They were written in the book Hilkiah the priest had found in the Temple of the Lord."
2 Kings,23,25,"There was no king like Josiah before or after him. He obeyed the Lord with all his heart, soul and strength. He followed all the Teachings of Moses."
2 Kings,23,26,"Even so, the Lord did not stop his strong and terrible anger. His anger burned against Judah. It was because of all that Manasseh had done to make him angry."
2 Kings,23,27,"The Lord said, “I have taken Israel away. I will do the same to Judah. I will take them out of my sight. I will reject Jerusalem which I chose. I will take away the Temple about which I said, ‘I will be honored there.’”"
2 Kings,23,28,Everything else Josiah did is written down. It is in the book of the history of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,23,29,"While Josiah was king, Neco king of Egypt went to help the king of Assyria. Neco was at the Euphrates River. King Josiah marched out to fight against Neco. But at Megiddo, Neco faced Josiah and killed him."
2 Kings,23,30,Josiah’s servants carried his body in a chariot from Megiddo. They brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his own grave. Then the people of Judah chose Josiah’s son Jehoahaz. They poured olive oil on him to appoint him king in his father’s place.
2 Kings,23,31,Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became king. And he was king in Jerusalem for three months. His mother’s name was Hamutal. She was the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah.
2 Kings,23,32,Jehoahaz did what the Lord said was wrong. He did just as his ancestors had done.
2 Kings,23,33,"King Neco took Jehoahaz prisoner at Riblah in the land of Hamath. He did this so Jehoahaz could not rule in Jerusalem. Neco made the people of Judah pay about 7,500 pounds of silver and about 75 pounds of gold."
2 Kings,23,34,"King Neco made Josiah’s son Eliakim the king in place of Josiah his father. Then Neco changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Jehoahaz to Egypt, and he died there."
2 Kings,23,35,Jehoiakim gave King Neco the silver and gold he demanded. But Jehoiakim taxed the land so he could pay the king. He took silver and gold from the people of the land. The amount he took from each person depended on how much he had.
2 Kings,23,36,Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king. He was king in Jerusalem for 11 years. His mother’s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah. She was from Rumah.
2 Kings,23,37,"Jehoiakim did what the Lord said was wrong, just as his ancestors had done."
2 Kings,24,1,"While Jehoiakim was king, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked the land of Judah. So Jehoiakim became Nebuchadnezzar’s servant for three years. Then Jehoiakim turned against Nebuchadnezzar. And he broke away from his rule."
2 Kings,24,2,"The Lord sent men from Babylon, Aram, Moab and Ammon against Jehoiakim. He sent them to destroy Judah. This happened the way the Lord had said it would through his servants the prophets."
2 Kings,24,3,The Lord commanded this to happen to the people of Judah. He did it to remove them from his presence. This was because of all the sins Manasseh had done.
2 Kings,24,4,He had killed many innocent people. He had filled Jerusalem with their blood. And the Lord would not forgive these sins.
2 Kings,24,5,The other things that happened while Jehoiakim was king and all he did are written down. They are in the book of the history of the kings of Judah.
2 Kings,24,6,"Jehoiakim died, and his son Jehoiachin became king in his place."
2 Kings,24,7,The king of Egypt did not come out of his land again. This was because of the king of Babylon. He had captured all that belonged to the king of Egypt. He took all the land from the brook of Egypt to the Euphrates River.
2 Kings,24,8,Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king. He was king three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan. She was from Jerusalem.
2 Kings,24,9,"Jehoiachin did what the Lord said was wrong, just as his father had done."
2 Kings,24,10,At that time the officers of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem. They surrounded the city and attacked it.
2 Kings,24,11,Nebuchadnezzar himself came to the city while his officers were attacking it.
2 Kings,24,12,"Jehoiachin king of Judah surrendered to the king of Babylon. Jehoiachin’s mother, servants, elders and officers also surrendered. Then the king of Babylon made Jehoiachin a prisoner. This was in the eighth year Nebuchadnezzar was king."
2 Kings,24,13,Nebuchadnezzar took all the treasures from the Temple of the Lord. He also removed the treasures from the palace. He took all the gold objects Solomon king of Israel had made for the Temple. This happened as the Lord had said it would.
2 Kings,24,14,"Nebuchadnezzar took away all the people of Jerusalem. This included all the leaders and all the wealthy people. He also took all the craftsmen and metal workers. There were 10,000 prisoners in all. Only the poorest people in the land were left."
2 Kings,24,15,Nebuchadnezzar carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon. He took the king’s mother and his wives. He also took the officers and leading men of the land. They were taken captive from Jerusalem to Babylon.
2 Kings,24,16,"The king of Babylon also took all 7,000 soldiers. These men were all strong and able to fight in war. And 1,000 craftsmen and metal workers were taken, too. Nebuchadnezzar took them as prisoners to Babylon."
2 Kings,24,17,He made Mattaniah king in Jehoiachin’s place. Mattaniah was Jehoiachin’s uncle. He also changed Mattaniah’s name to Zedekiah.
2 Kings,24,18,Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king. And he was king in Jerusalem for 11 years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah. She was from Libnah.
2 Kings,24,19,"Zedekiah did what the Lord said was wrong, just as Jehoiakim had done."
2 Kings,24,20,"All this happened in Jerusalem and Judah because the Lord was angry with them. Finally, he threw them out of his presence. Zedekiah turned against the king of Babylon."
2 Kings,25,1,"Then Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. This happened during Zedekiah’s ninth year, tenth month and tenth day as king. He made a camp around the city. Then he built devices all around the city walls to attack it."
2 Kings,25,2,The city was under attack until Zedekiah’s eleventh year as king.
2 Kings,25,3,"By the ninth day of the fourth month, the hunger was terrible in the city. There was no food for the people to eat."
2 Kings,25,4,Then the city wall was broken through. And the whole army ran away at night. They went through the gate between the two walls by the king’s garden. The Babylonians were still surrounding the city. Zedekiah and his men ran toward the Jordan Valley.
2 Kings,25,5,But the Babylonian army chased King Zedekiah. They caught up with him in the plains of Jericho. All of his army was scattered from him.
2 Kings,25,6,So they captured Zedekiah and took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah. There he passed sentence on Zedekiah.
2 Kings,25,7,They killed Zedekiah’s sons as he watched. Then they put out his eyes. They put bronze chains on him and took him to Babylon.
2 Kings,25,8,Nebuzaradan was the commander of the king’s special guards. This officer of the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem. This was on the seventh day of the fifth month. This was in Nebuchadnezzar’s nineteenth year as king of Babylon.
2 Kings,25,9,Nebuzaradan set fire to the Temple of the Lord and the palace. He also set fire to all the houses of Jerusalem. Every important building was burned.
2 Kings,25,10,The whole Babylonian army broke down the walls around Jerusalem. That army was led by the commander of the king’s special guards.
2 Kings,25,11,"Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, took captive the people left in Jerusalem. And he took captive those who had surrendered to the king of Babylon. The rest of the people were also taken away."
2 Kings,25,12,But the commander left behind some of the poorest people of the land. They were to take care of the vineyards and fields.
2 Kings,25,13,"The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the bronze stands and the large bronze bowl, which was called the Sea. These were in the Temple of the Lord. Then they carried the bronze to Babylon."
2 Kings,25,14,"They also took the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes and all the bronze objects. These were used to serve in the Temple."
2 Kings,25,15,The commander of the king’s special guards took away the pans for carrying hot coals. He also took the bowls and everything made of pure gold or silver.
2 Kings,25,16,There was so much bronze that it could not be weighed. There were two pillars and the large bronze bowl. There were also the movable stands which Solomon had made for the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings,25,17,Each pillar was about 27 feet high. The bronze capital on top of the pillar was about 4½ feet high. It was decorated with a net design and bronze pomegranates all around it. The other pillar also had a net design. It was like the first pillar.
2 Kings,25,18,"The commander of the guards took some prisoners. He took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank, and the three doorkeepers."
2 Kings,25,19,The commander also took other people who were still in the city. He took the officer in charge of the fighting men. He also took five people who advised the king. And he took the royal assistant who selected people for the army. And he took 60 other men who were in the city.
2 Kings,25,20,"Nebuzaradan, the commander, took all these people. And he brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah."
2 Kings,25,21,"There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them killed. So the people of Judah were led away from their country as captives."
2 Kings,25,22,Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon left some people in the land of Judah. He appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor. (Ahikam was the son of Shaphan.)
2 Kings,25,23,"The army captains and their men heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor. So they all came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. They were Ishmael son of Nethaniah and Johanan son of Kareah. Also there were Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite and their men."
2 Kings,25,24,"Then Gedaliah made promises to these army captains and their men. He said, “Don’t be afraid of the Babylonian officers. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon. Then everything will go well for you.”"
2 Kings,25,25,Ishmael was the son of Nethaniah. Nethaniah was the son of Elishama from the king’s family. In the seventh month Ishmael came with ten men and killed Gedaliah. They also killed the men of Judah and Babylon who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah.
2 Kings,25,26,"Then all the people, from the least important to the most important, ran away to Egypt. The army leaders also went. This was because they were afraid of the Babylonians."
2 Kings,25,27,Jehoiachin king of Judah was held in Babylon for 37 years. In the thirty-seventh year Evil-Merodach became king of Babylon. He let Jehoiachin out of prison on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month.
2 Kings,25,28,Evil-Merodach spoke kindly to Jehoiachin. He gave Jehoiachin a seat of honor. It was above the seats of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
2 Kings,25,29,"So Jehoiachin put away his prison clothes. For the rest of his life, he ate at the king’s table."
2 Kings,25,30,Every day the king gave Jehoiachin an allowance. This lasted as long as he lived.
