Deuteronomy,1,1,"This is the message Moses gave the people of Israel. They were in the desert east of the Jordan River. They were in the Jordan Valley near Suph, between Paran and the towns of Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab."
Deuteronomy,1,2,(The trip from Mount Sinai to Kadesh Barnea on the Mount Edom road takes 11 days.)
Deuteronomy,1,3,"But it was now 40 years after the Israelites had left Egypt. On the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the people. He told them everything the Lord had commanded him to tell them."
Deuteronomy,1,4,This was after the Lord had defeated Sihon and Og. Sihon was king of the Amorite people and lived in Heshbon. Og was king of Bashan and lived in Ashteroth and Edrei.
Deuteronomy,1,5,Now the Israelites were east of the Jordan River in the land of Moab. There Moses began to explain what God had commanded. Moses said:
Deuteronomy,1,6,"The Lord our God spoke to us at Mount Sinai. He said, “You have stayed long enough at this mountain."
Deuteronomy,1,7,"Get ready. Go to the mountain country of the Amorites. Go to all the places around there—the Jordan Valley, the mountains, the western slopes, the southern area, the seacoast, the land of Canaan and Lebanon. Go as far as the great river, the Euphrates."
Deuteronomy,1,8,"See, I have given you this land. Go in and take it for yourselves. The Lord promised it to your ancestors—Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their descendants.”"
Deuteronomy,1,9,"At that time I said, “I am not able to take care of you by myself."
Deuteronomy,1,10,The Lord your God has made you grow in number. There are as many of you as there are stars in the sky.
Deuteronomy,1,11,"I pray that the Lord, the God of your ancestors, will give you a thousand times more people. That’s what he promised."
Deuteronomy,1,12,"But I cannot take care of your problems, your troubles and your arguments by myself."
Deuteronomy,1,13,So choose some men from each tribe. Choose wise men who have understanding and experience. I will make them leaders over you.”
Deuteronomy,1,14,"And you said, “That’s a good thing to do.”"
Deuteronomy,1,15,"So I took the wise and experienced leaders of your tribes. And I made them your leaders. I appointed commanders over 1,000 people, over 100 people, over 50 people and over 10 people. I made them officers over your tribes."
Deuteronomy,1,16,"Then I told your judges, “Listen to the arguments between your people. Judge fairly between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner."
Deuteronomy,1,17,"When you judge, be fair to everyone. Don’t act as if one person is more important than another. Don’t be afraid of anyone, because your decision comes from God. Bring the hard cases to me. I will judge them.”"
Deuteronomy,1,18,At that time I told you everything you must do.
Deuteronomy,1,19,"Then, as the Lord our God commanded us, we left Mount Sinai. We went toward the mountain country of the Amorite people. We went through that large and terrible desert you saw. Then we came to Kadesh Barnea."
Deuteronomy,1,20,"Then I said to you, “You have now come to the mountain country of the Amorites. The Lord our God will give us this land."
Deuteronomy,1,21,"Look, there it is! Go up. Take it. The Lord, the God of your ancestors, told you to do this. So don’t be afraid. Don’t worry.”"
Deuteronomy,1,22,"Then all of you came to me. You said, “Let’s send men before us to spy out the land. They can come back and tell us the way we should go. They can tell us about the cities we will find.”"
Deuteronomy,1,23,"I thought that was a good idea. So I chose 12 of your men, 1 for each tribe."
Deuteronomy,1,24,They left and went up to the mountains. They came to the Valley of Eshcol and explored it.
Deuteronomy,1,25,"They took some of the fruit from that land. And they brought it down to us. They said, “It is a good land that the Lord our God is giving us.”"
Deuteronomy,1,26,But you refused to go. You would not obey the command of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,1,27,"You grumbled in your tents. You said, “The Lord hates us. He brought us out of Egypt just to give us to the Amorites. They will destroy us."
Deuteronomy,1,28,"Where can we go now? The spies we sent have made us afraid. They said, ‘The people there are bigger and taller than we are. The cities are big. They have walls up to the sky. And we saw the Anakites there!’”"
Deuteronomy,1,29,"Then I said to you, “Don’t be frightened. Don’t be afraid of those people."
Deuteronomy,1,30,The Lord your God will go ahead of you. He will fight for you as he did in Egypt. You saw him do it.
Deuteronomy,1,31,And in the desert you saw how the Lord your God carried you. He was like a man carrying his son. And he has brought you safely all the way to this place.”
Deuteronomy,1,32,But you still did not trust the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,1,33,"As you moved, he went before you. He found places for you to camp. He went before you in a fire at night and in a cloud during the day. He showed you which way to go."
Deuteronomy,1,34,"When the Lord heard what you said, he was angry. He made a promise. He said,"
Deuteronomy,1,35,“I promised a good land to your ancestors. But none of you evil people will see it.
Deuteronomy,1,36,Only Caleb son of Jephunneh will see it. I will give him and his descendants the land he walked on. I will do this because he followed me completely.”
Deuteronomy,1,37,"Because of you, the Lord was also angry with me. He said to me, “You won’t enter the land either."
Deuteronomy,1,38,"But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will go there. Encourage Joshua, because he will lead Israel to take the land for their own.”"
Deuteronomy,1,39,"The Lord said to us, “You said your babies would be captured. But they will go into the land. They are too young to know right from wrong. So I will give the land to them. And they will take it for their own."
Deuteronomy,1,40,But you must turn around. Follow the desert road toward the Gulf of Aqaba.”
Deuteronomy,1,41,"Then you said to me, “We have sinned against the Lord. But now we will go up and fight, as the Lord our God commanded us.” Then all of you put on weapons. You thought it would be easy to go into the mountains."
Deuteronomy,1,42,"But the Lord said to me, “Tell them not to go up there and fight. I will not be with them. Their enemies will defeat them.”"
Deuteronomy,1,43,"So I told you, but you would not listen. You would not obey the Lord’s command. You were proud. So you went on up into the mountains."
Deuteronomy,1,44,The Amorites who lived there came out and fought you. They chased you like bees. They defeated you from Edom to Hormah.
Deuteronomy,1,45,So you came back and cried to the Lord. But the Lord did not hear you. He refused to listen to you.
Deuteronomy,1,46,So you stayed in Kadesh a long time.
Deuteronomy,2,1,Then we turned around. And we traveled on the desert road toward the Gulf of Aqaba. That is what the Lord had told me to do. We traveled through the mountains of Edom for many days.
Deuteronomy,2,2,"Then the Lord said to me,"
Deuteronomy,2,3,“You have traveled through these mountains long enough. Turn north.
Deuteronomy,2,4,"Tell the people this: ‘You will soon go through the land of Edom. This land belongs to your relatives, the descendants of Esau. They will be afraid of you. But be very careful."
Deuteronomy,2,5,Don’t go to war against them. I am not giving you any of their land—not even a foot of it. I have given the mountains of Edom to Esau as his own.
Deuteronomy,2,6,You must pay them in silver for any food you eat or water you drink.’”
Deuteronomy,2,7,The Lord your God has blessed everything you have done. He has protected you while you traveled through this large desert. The Lord your God has been with you for these 40 years. You have had everything you needed.
Deuteronomy,2,8,"So we passed by our relatives, the people of Esau who lived in Edom. We turned off the Jordan Valley road. It comes from the towns of Elath and Ezion Geber. And we traveled along the desert road of Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,9,"Then the Lord said to me, “Don’t bother the people of Moab. Don’t go to war against them. I am not giving you any of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot.”"
Deuteronomy,2,10,"(The Emites lived in Ar before. They were strong people, and there were many of them. They were very tall, like the Anakites."
Deuteronomy,2,11,"The Emites were thought to be Rephaites, like the Anakites. But the Moabite people called them Emites."
Deuteronomy,2,12,The Horites also lived in Edom before. But the people of Esau forced them out. They destroyed the Horites and took their place. That is also what Israel did in the land the Lord gave them as their own.)
Deuteronomy,2,13,"And the Lord said to me, “Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.” So we crossed the valley."
Deuteronomy,2,14,"It had been 38 years since we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley. By then, all the fighting men from that time had died. This is what the Lord had promised would happen."
Deuteronomy,2,15,The Lord had continued to destroy them until they were all gone from the camp.
Deuteronomy,2,16,Now the last of those fighting men had died.
Deuteronomy,2,17,"Then the Lord said to me,"
Deuteronomy,2,18,"“Today you must go by Ar, on the border of Moab."
Deuteronomy,2,19,"When you come near the people of Ammon, don’t bother them. Don’t go to war against them. I am not giving you their land. I have given that land to the descendants of Lot.”"
Deuteronomy,2,20,(That land was also thought to be a land of Rephaites. Those people used to live there. But the Ammonites called them Zamzummites.
Deuteronomy,2,21,"They were strong people, and there were many of them. They were very tall, like the Anakites. The Lord went before the Ammonites and destroyed the Zamzummites. The Ammonites forced them out of the land and took their place."
Deuteronomy,2,22,The Lord did the same thing for the descendants of Esau. They lived in Edom. He destroyed the Horites. The Edomites forced them out of the land and took their place. And they live there to this day.
Deuteronomy,2,23,The Caphtorite people came from Crete. They destroyed the Avvites. The Avvites lived in towns all the way to Gaza. But the Caphtorites destroyed them and took their place.)
Deuteronomy,2,24,"The Lord said, “Get up. Cross the Arnon Ravine. See, I am giving you the power to defeat Sihon the Amorite. He is king of Heshbon. I am giving you his land. So fight against him and begin taking his land."
Deuteronomy,2,25,Today I will begin to make all the people in the world afraid of you. They will hear reports about you. And they will shake with fear. They will be terrified of you.”
Deuteronomy,2,26,"I sent messengers from the desert of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon. They offered him peace. They said,"
Deuteronomy,2,27,“Let us pass through your country. We will stay on the road. We will not turn right or left.
Deuteronomy,2,28,We will pay you in silver for any food we eat or water we drink. We only want to walk through your country.
Deuteronomy,2,29,The descendants of Esau in Edom let us go through their land. So did the Moabites in Ar. We want to cross the Jordan River into the land the Lord our God has given us.”
Deuteronomy,2,30,But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass. The Lord your God had made him stubborn. The Lord wanted you to defeat Sihon. And now this has happened.
Deuteronomy,2,31,"The Lord said to me, “See, I have begun to give Sihon and his country to you. Begin taking the land as your own.”"
Deuteronomy,2,32,Then Sihon and all his army came out. And they fought us at Jahaz.
Deuteronomy,2,33,"But the Lord our God gave Sihon to us. We defeated him, his sons and all his army."
Deuteronomy,2,34,"We captured all his cities. We completely destroyed them, the men, women and children. We left no one alive."
Deuteronomy,2,35,But we kept the cattle and valuable things from the cities for ourselves.
Deuteronomy,2,36,"We defeated Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Ravine. And we defeated the town in the ravine, and even Gilead. No town was too strong for us. The Lord our God gave us all of them."
Deuteronomy,2,37,But you did not go near the land of the Ammonites. You did not go near the shores of the Jabbok River. You did not go near the towns in the mountains. This was what the Lord our God had commanded.
Deuteronomy,3,1,Then we turned and went up the road toward Bashan. Og king of Bashan and all his army came out to fight us at Edrei.
Deuteronomy,3,2,"The Lord said to me, “Don’t be afraid of Og. I will hand him, his whole army and his land over to you. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon.”"
Deuteronomy,3,3,So the Lord our God gave us Og king of Bashan and all his army. We defeated them and left no one alive.
Deuteronomy,3,4,"Then we captured all of Og’s cities. We captured all 60 of them. We took the whole area of Argob, Og’s kingdom in Bashan."
Deuteronomy,3,5,All these were strong cities. They had high walls and gates with bars. And there were also many small towns with no walls.
Deuteronomy,3,6,"We completely destroyed them. We destroyed them just like the cities of Sihon king of Heshbon. We killed all the men, women and children."
Deuteronomy,3,7,But we kept all the cattle and valuable things from the cities for ourselves.
Deuteronomy,3,8,So at that time we took the land east of the Jordan River. We took it from these two Amorite kings. It went from the Arnon Ravine to Mount Hermon.
Deuteronomy,3,9,(Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonian people. The Amorites call it Senir.)
Deuteronomy,3,10,We captured all the cities on the high plain and all of Gilead. We took all of Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei. These were towns in Og’s kingdom of Bashan.
Deuteronomy,3,11,(Only Og king of Bashan was left of the few Rephaites. His bed was made of iron. It was more than 13 feet long and 6 feet wide! It is still in the Ammonite city of Rabbah.)
Deuteronomy,3,12,At that time we took this land to be our own. I gave the people of Reuben and Gad the land from Aroer by the Arnon Ravine. And I gave them half of the mountain country of Gilead and the cities in it.
Deuteronomy,3,13,"To the eastern half-tribe of Manasseh I gave the rest of Gilead. And I gave them all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og. (The area of Argob in Bashan was called the land of the Rephaites."
Deuteronomy,3,14,"Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole area of Argob. It went to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. That land was named for Jair. So even today Bashan is called the Towns of Jair.)"
Deuteronomy,3,15,I gave Gilead to Makir.
Deuteronomy,3,16,I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the land that begins at Gilead. It goes from the Arnon Ravine to the Jabbok River. (The middle of the Arnon is the border.) The Jabbok River is the Ammonite border.
Deuteronomy,3,17,The border on the west was the Jordan River in the Jordan Valley. It goes from Lake Galilee to the Dead Sea west of Mount Pisgah.
Deuteronomy,3,18,At that time I gave you this command: “The Lord your God has given you this land as your own. Now your fighting men must take their weapons. And you must lead the other Israelites across the river.
Deuteronomy,3,19,"Your wives, your young children and your cattle may stay here. I know you have many cattle. They may stay here in the cities I have given you."
Deuteronomy,3,20,"Some day your Israelite relatives will also have a place to rest. They will receive the land the Lord your God has given them. It is on the other side of the Jordan River. After that, you may each return to the land I have given you.”"
Deuteronomy,3,21,Then I gave this command to Joshua: “You have seen for yourself what the Lord your God has done to these two kings. The Lord will do the same thing to all the kingdoms where you are going.
Deuteronomy,3,22,Don’t be afraid of them. The Lord your God will fight for you.”
Deuteronomy,3,23,Then I begged the Lord:
Deuteronomy,3,24,"“Lord God, you have begun to show me, your servant, how great you are. You have great strength. No other god in heaven or earth can do the powerful things you do. There is no other god like you."
Deuteronomy,3,25,Please let me cross the Jordan River. I want to see the beautiful mountains and Lebanon.”
Deuteronomy,3,26,"But the Lord was angry with me because of you. He would not listen to me. The Lord said to me, “That’s enough. Don’t talk to me anymore about it."
Deuteronomy,3,27,"Climb to the top of Mount Pisgah. Look west, north, south and east. You can look at the land. But you will not cross the Jordan River."
Deuteronomy,3,28,Appoint Joshua. Help him be brave and strong. He will lead the people across the river. He will give them the land that they are to inherit. You can only look at it.”
Deuteronomy,3,29,So we stayed in the valley opposite Beth Peor.
Deuteronomy,4,1,"Now, Israel, listen to the laws and commands I will teach you. Obey them so you will live. Then you will go over and take the land. The Lord, the God of your ancestors, is giving it to you."
Deuteronomy,4,2,Don’t add to these commands. And don’t leave anything out. But obey the commands of the Lord your God that I give you.
Deuteronomy,4,3,You have seen for yourselves what the Lord did at Baal Peor. The Lord your God destroyed everyone among you who followed Baal in Peor.
Deuteronomy,4,4,But you continued to follow the Lord your God. So you are still alive today.
Deuteronomy,4,5,"Look, I have taught you the laws and rules the Lord my God commanded me. Now you can obey the laws in the land you are entering. It is the land you will own."
Deuteronomy,4,6,"Obey these laws carefully. This will show the other nations that you have wisdom and understanding. They will hear about these laws. And they will say, “This great nation of Israel is wise and understanding.”"
Deuteronomy,4,7,No other nation is as great as we are. Their gods do not come near them. But the Lord our God comes near when we pray to him.
Deuteronomy,4,8,And no other nation has such good teachings and commands. I am giving them to you today.
Deuteronomy,4,9,But be careful! Watch out. Don’t forget the things that you have seen. Don’t forget them as long as you live. Teach them to your children and grandchildren.
Deuteronomy,4,10,"Remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Mount Sinai. He said to me, “Bring the people together to listen to what I say. Then they will respect me as long as they live in the land. And they will teach these things to their children.”"
Deuteronomy,4,11,Then you came and stood at the bottom of the mountain. It blazed with fire that reached to the sky. Black clouds made it very dark.
Deuteronomy,4,12,Then the Lord spoke to you from the fire. You heard the sound of words. But you did not see him. There was only a voice.
Deuteronomy,4,13,The Lord told you about his agreement. It was the Ten Commandments. And he told you to obey them. Then he wrote them on two stone tablets.
Deuteronomy,4,14,Then the Lord commanded me to teach you the laws and rules. You must obey them in the land you will own when you cross the Jordan River.
Deuteronomy,4,15,The Lord spoke to you from the fire at Mount Sinai. But you did not see him. So watch yourselves carefully!
Deuteronomy,4,16,Don’t sin by making idols of any kind. Don’t make statues of men or women.
Deuteronomy,4,17,Don’t make statues of animals on earth or birds that fly in the air.
Deuteronomy,4,18,Don’t make statues of anything that crawls on the ground. Don’t make statues of fish in the water below.
Deuteronomy,4,19,"When you look up at the sky, you see the sun, moon and stars. You can see everything in the sky. But don’t bow down and worship them. The Lord your God has made these things for all people everywhere."
Deuteronomy,4,20,"Egypt tested you like a furnace for melting iron. The Lord brought you out of Egypt. And he made you his very own people, as you are now."
Deuteronomy,4,21,The Lord was angry with me because of you. He made a strong promise that I would not cross the Jordan River. I could not go into the good land the Lord your God is giving you to own.
Deuteronomy,4,22,I will die here in this land. I will not cross the Jordan. But you will soon go across and take that good land.
Deuteronomy,4,23,Be careful. Don’t forget the agreement of the Lord your God that he made with you. Don’t make any idols for yourselves. The Lord your God has commanded you not to do that.
Deuteronomy,4,24,The Lord your God is a jealous God. He is like a fire that burns things up.
Deuteronomy,4,25,"You will live in the land a long time. You will have children and grandchildren. Even after that, don’t do evil things. Don’t make any kind of idol. Don’t do what the Lord says is evil. That will make him angry."
Deuteronomy,4,26,I will ask heaven and earth to speak against you that day. Then you will quickly be removed from this land. You are crossing the Jordan River to take the land. But you will not live there long after that. You will be completely destroyed.
Deuteronomy,4,27,The Lord will scatter you among the other nations. Only a few of you will be left alive. And those few will be in other nations where the Lord will send you.
Deuteronomy,4,28,"There you will worship gods made by men. They will be made of wood and stone. They cannot see, hear, eat or smell."
Deuteronomy,4,29,But even there you can look for the Lord your God. And you will find him if you look. But you must look for him with your whole being.
Deuteronomy,4,30,It will be hard when all these things happen to you. But after that you will come back to the Lord your God. You will obey him.
Deuteronomy,4,31,The Lord your God is a merciful God. He will not leave you or destroy you. He will not forget the agreement he made with your ancestors. He made that agreement sure with his strong promise.
Deuteronomy,4,32,"Nothing like this has ever happened before! Look at the past, long before you were even born. Go all the way back to when God made man on the earth. Look from one end of heaven to the other. Nothing like this has ever been heard of!"
Deuteronomy,4,33,No other people have ever heard God speak from a fire and still lived. But you have.
Deuteronomy,4,34,"No other god has ever taken for himself one nation out of another. But the Lord your God did this for you in Egypt. He did it right before your own eyes. He did it with tests, signs, miracles, war and great sights. He did it by his great power and strength."
Deuteronomy,4,35,He showed you things so you would know that the Lord is God. There is no other God besides him.
Deuteronomy,4,36,He spoke to you from heaven to teach you. He showed you his great fire on earth. And you heard him speak from the fire.
Deuteronomy,4,37,"The Lord loved your ancestors. That is why he chose you, their descendants. He brought you out of Egypt himself by his great strength."
Deuteronomy,4,38,He forced nations out of their land ahead of you. And these nations were bigger and stronger than you were. But the Lord brought you into their land and gave it to you to own. And this land is yours today.
Deuteronomy,4,39,Know and believe today that the Lord is God. He is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other god!
Deuteronomy,4,40,"Obey his laws and commands, which I am giving you today. Obey them so that things will go well for you and your children. Then you will live a long time in this land. The Lord your God is giving it to you forever."
Deuteronomy,4,41,Moses chose three cities east of the Jordan River.
Deuteronomy,4,42,A person who killed someone accidentally could go there. He did not hate the person he killed. So he could save his life by running to one of these cities.
Deuteronomy,4,43,These were the cities: Bezer in the desert high plain was for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead was for the Gadites; Golan in Bashan was for the Manassites.
Deuteronomy,4,44,These are the teachings Moses gave to the people of Israel.
Deuteronomy,4,45,"They are the rules, commands and laws he gave them when they came out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,4,46,They were in the valley near Beth Peor. That is east of the Jordan River in the land of Sihon. Sihon was king of the Amorites. He ruled in Heshbon. He was defeated by Moses and the Israelites as they came out of Egypt.
Deuteronomy,4,47,The Israelites captured his land. They also took the land of Og king of Bashan. These were the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River.
Deuteronomy,4,48,This land went from Aroer to Mount Hermon. Aroer is on the edge of the Arnon Ravine.
Deuteronomy,4,49,It included all the Jordan Valley east of the Jordan River. And it went as far as the Dead Sea below Mount Pisgah.
Deuteronomy,5,1,"Moses called all the people of Israel together and said: Listen, Israel, to the commands and laws I give you today. Learn them and obey them carefully."
Deuteronomy,5,2,The Lord our God made an agreement with us at Mount Sinai.
Deuteronomy,5,3,He did not make this agreement with our ancestors. He made it with us. He made it with all of us who are alive here today.
Deuteronomy,5,4,The Lord spoke to you face to face. He spoke from the fire on the mountain.
Deuteronomy,5,5,(At that time I stood between you and the Lord. I told you what the Lord said. You were afraid of the fire. So you would not go up on the mountain.) The Lord said:
Deuteronomy,5,6,“I am the Lord your God. I brought you out of the land of Egypt where you were slaves.
Deuteronomy,5,7,“You must not have any other gods except me.
Deuteronomy,5,8,“You must not make for yourselves any idols. Don’t make something that looks like anything in the sky above or on the earth below or in the water below the land.
Deuteronomy,5,9,"You must not worship or serve any idol. This is because I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God. A person may sin against me and hate me. I will punish his children, even his grandchildren and great-grandchildren."
Deuteronomy,5,10,But I will be very kind to thousands who love me and obey my commands.
Deuteronomy,5,11,“You must not use the name of the Lord your God thoughtlessly. The Lord will punish anyone who is guilty and misuses his name.
Deuteronomy,5,12,“Keep the Sabbath as a holy day. The Lord your God has commanded you to do this.
Deuteronomy,5,13,You may work and get everything done during six days each week.
Deuteronomy,5,14,"But the seventh day is a day of rest to honor the Lord your God. On that day no one may do any work: not you, your son or daughter, or your men or women slaves. Neither your ox, your donkey nor any of your animals may work. The foreigners living in your cities may not work. That way your servants may rest as you do."
Deuteronomy,5,15,Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. The Lord your God brought you out of Egypt by his great power and strength. So the Lord your God has commanded you to rest on the Sabbath day.
Deuteronomy,5,16,“Honor your father and your mother. The Lord your God has commanded you to do this. Then you will live a long time. And things will go well for you in the land. The Lord your God is going to give you this land.
Deuteronomy,5,17,“You must not murder anyone.
Deuteronomy,5,18,“You must not be guilty of adultery.
Deuteronomy,5,19,“You must not steal.
Deuteronomy,5,20,“You must not tell lies about your neighbor in court.
Deuteronomy,5,21,“You must not want to take your neighbor’s wife. You must not want to take your neighbor’s house or land. You must not want to take his men or women slaves. You must not want to take his ox or his donkey. You must not want to take anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
Deuteronomy,5,22,The Lord gave these commands to all of you on the mountain. He spoke them in a loud voice out of the fire. He spoke from the cloud and the deep darkness. He did not say anything else. Then he wrote them on two stone tablets. And he gave them to me.
Deuteronomy,5,23,You heard the voice from the darkness. The mountain was blazing with fire. Then all the leaders of your tribes and your elders came to me.
Deuteronomy,5,24,"And you said, “The Lord our God has shown us his glory and majesty. We have heard his voice from the fire. Today we have seen that a person can live even if God speaks to him."
Deuteronomy,5,25,"But now, we will die! This great fire will burn us up. And we will die if we hear the Lord our God speak anymore."
Deuteronomy,5,26,No human being has ever heard the living God speaking from a fire and still lived. But we have.
Deuteronomy,5,27,"Moses, you go near and listen to everything the Lord our God says. Then you tell us what the Lord our God tells you. We will listen and obey.”"
Deuteronomy,5,28,"The Lord heard what you said to me. And he said to me, “I have heard what the people said to you. Everything they said was good."
Deuteronomy,5,29,I wish their hearts would always respect me. I wish they would always obey my commands. Then things would go well for them and their children forever!
Deuteronomy,5,30,“Go and tell the people to return to their tents.
Deuteronomy,5,31,"But you stay here with me. I will give you all the commands, rules and laws. Teach the people to obey them in the land I am giving them to own.”"
Deuteronomy,5,32,So be careful. Do what the Lord your God has commanded you. You must follow the commands exactly.
Deuteronomy,5,33,Live the way the Lord your God has commanded you. Then you will live and be successful. You will live a long time in the land you will own.
Deuteronomy,6,1,"These are the commands, rules and laws of the Lord your God. He told me to teach them to you. Obey them in the land you are crossing the Jordan River to own."
Deuteronomy,6,2,"You, your children and grandchildren must respect the Lord your God. You must do this as long as you live. Obey all his rules and commands I give you. Then you will live a long time."
Deuteronomy,6,3,"Listen, Israel, and carefully obey these laws. Then all will go well for you. You will become a great nation in a land where much food grows. The Lord, the God of your ancestors, has promised it to you."
Deuteronomy,6,4,"Listen, people of Israel! The Lord is our God. He is the only Lord."
Deuteronomy,6,5,"Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul and strength."
Deuteronomy,6,6,Always remember these commands I give you today.
Deuteronomy,6,7,Teach them to your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and walk along the road. Talk about them when you lie down and when you get up.
Deuteronomy,6,8,Write them down and tie them to your hands as a sign. Tie them on your forehead to remind you.
Deuteronomy,6,9,Write them on your doors and gates.
Deuteronomy,6,10,"The Lord your God will bring you into the land. He promised it to your ancestors, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He will give it to you. The land has large, growing cities you did not build."
Deuteronomy,6,11,The houses there are full of good things that you did not buy. They have wells you did not dig. There are vineyards and olive trees you did not plant. You will eat as much as you want.
Deuteronomy,6,12,But be careful! Do not forget the Lord. He brought you out of the land of Egypt where you were slaves.
Deuteronomy,6,13,Respect the Lord your God. Serve only him. Make your promises in his name.
Deuteronomy,6,14,Do not worship other gods as the people around you do.
Deuteronomy,6,15,"The Lord your God is a jealous God. He is present with you. If you worship other gods, he will become angry with you. And he will destroy you from the earth."
Deuteronomy,6,16,Do not test the Lord your God as you did at Massah.
Deuteronomy,6,17,Be sure to obey the commands of the Lord your God. Obey the rules and laws he has given you.
Deuteronomy,6,18,Do what the Lord says is good and right. Then things will go well for you. Then you may go in and take the good land the Lord promised to your ancestors.
Deuteronomy,6,19,He will force all your enemies out as you go in. This is what the Lord has said.
Deuteronomy,6,20,"In the future your son will ask you, “What do the laws, commands and rules the Lord our God gave us mean?”"
Deuteronomy,6,21,"Tell him, “We were slaves to the king of Egypt. But the Lord brought us out of Egypt by his great power."
Deuteronomy,6,22,"The Lord showed us great and terrible signs and miracles. He did them to Egypt, the king and his whole family."
Deuteronomy,6,23,The Lord brought us out of Egypt. He led us here. And he will give us the land he promised our ancestors.
Deuteronomy,6,24,The Lord ordered us to obey all these commands. And we must respect the Lord our God. Then we will always do well and stay alive as we are today.
Deuteronomy,6,25,The right thing for us to do is this: Obey all these rules in the presence of the Lord our God. He has commanded it.”
Deuteronomy,7,1,"The Lord your God will bring you into the land. You are entering that land to own it. As you go in, he will force out these nations: the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. These seven nations are stronger than you."
Deuteronomy,7,2,The Lord your God will hand these nations over to you. You will defeat them. You must destroy them completely. Do not make a peace treaty with them. Do not show them any mercy.
Deuteronomy,7,3,Do not marry any of them. Don’t let your daughters marry their sons. And don’t let your sons marry their daughters.
Deuteronomy,7,4,Those people will turn your children away from me. Your children will begin serving other gods. The Lord will be very angry with you. And he will quickly destroy you.
Deuteronomy,7,5,This is what you must do to those people: Tear down their altars. Smash their holy stone pillars. Cut down their Asherah idols and burn their idols in the fire.
Deuteronomy,7,6,You are holy people. You belong to the Lord your God. He has chosen you from all the people on earth. You are his very own.
Deuteronomy,7,7,The Lord did not care for you and choose you because there were many of you. You are the smallest nation of all.
Deuteronomy,7,8,But the Lord chose you because he loved you. And he kept his promise to your ancestors. So he brought you out of Egypt by his great power. He brought you back from the land of slavery. He bought you back from the power of the king of Egypt.
Deuteronomy,7,9,So know that the Lord your God is God. He is the faithful God. He will keep his agreement of love for a thousand lifetimes. He does this for people who love him and obey his commands.
Deuteronomy,7,10,But he will pay back those people who hate him. He will destroy them. And he will not be slow to pay back those who hate him.
Deuteronomy,7,11,"So be careful to obey the commands, rules and laws I give you today."
Deuteronomy,7,12,Pay attention to these laws. Obey them carefully. Then the Lord your God will keep his agreement and show his love to you. He promised your ancestors he would.
Deuteronomy,7,13,"He will love and bless you. He will make the number of your people grow. He will bless you with children. He will bless your fields with good crops. He will give you grain, new wine and oil. He will bless your cows with calves and your sheep with lambs. This is the way it will be in the land he promised your ancestors he would give you."
Deuteronomy,7,14,You will be blessed more than any other people. Every husband and wife will have children. All your cattle will have calves.
Deuteronomy,7,15,The Lord will take away all disease from you. You will not have the terrible diseases that were in Egypt. But he will give them to your enemies.
Deuteronomy,7,16,You must destroy all the people the Lord your God hands over to you. Do not feel sorry for them. Do not worship their gods. They will trap you.
Deuteronomy,7,17,"You might say to yourselves, “These nations are stronger than we are. We can’t force them out.”"
Deuteronomy,7,18,But don’t be afraid of them. Remember what the Lord your God did to all of Egypt and its king.
Deuteronomy,7,19,"You saw for yourselves the troubles, signs and miracles he did. You saw how the Lord’s great power and strength brought you out of Egypt. The Lord your God will do the same thing to all the nations you now fear."
Deuteronomy,7,20,The Lord your God will also send hornets to attack them. Even those who are alive and hiding from you will die.
Deuteronomy,7,21,Don’t be afraid of them. The Lord your God is with you. He is a great God and people are afraid of him.
Deuteronomy,7,22,"The Lord your God will force those nations out of the land. They will leave little by little ahead of you. Don’t destroy them all at once. Otherwise, the wild animals will grow too many in number."
Deuteronomy,7,23,But the Lord your God will hand those nations over to you. He will confuse them until they are destroyed.
Deuteronomy,7,24,The Lord will help you defeat their kings. The world will forget who they were. No one will be able to stop you. You will destroy them all.
Deuteronomy,7,25,"Burn up their idols in the fire. Do not wish for the silver and gold on them. Don’t take it for yourselves, or you will be trapped by it. The Lord your God hates it."
Deuteronomy,7,26,"Do not bring one of those hated things into your house. If you do, you will be completely destroyed along with it. Hate and reject those things. They must be completely destroyed."
Deuteronomy,8,1,Carefully obey every command I give you today. Then you will live and grow in number. And you will enter and own the land the Lord promised your ancestors.
Deuteronomy,8,2,Remember how the Lord your God has led you in the desert for these 40 years. He took away your pride. He tested you. He wanted to know what was in your heart. He wanted to know if you would obey his commands.
Deuteronomy,8,3,He took away your pride. He let you get hungry. Then he fed you with manna. Manna was something neither you nor your ancestors had ever seen. This was to teach you that a person does not live only by eating bread. But a person lives by everything the Lord says.
Deuteronomy,8,4,"During these 40 years, your clothes did not wear out. And your feet did not swell."
Deuteronomy,8,5,Know in your heart that the Lord your God corrects you. He corrects you as a father does his son.
Deuteronomy,8,6,Obey the commands of the Lord your God. Live as he has commanded you and respect him.
Deuteronomy,8,7,The Lord your God is bringing you into a good land. The land has rivers and pools of water. Springs flow in the valleys and hills.
Deuteronomy,8,8,"The land has wheat and barley, vines, fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil and honey."
Deuteronomy,8,9,It is a land where you will have plenty of food. You will have everything you need there. The rocks are iron. You can dig copper out of the hills.
Deuteronomy,8,10,You will have all you want to eat. Then praise the Lord your God. He has given you a good land.
Deuteronomy,8,11,"Be careful not to forget the Lord your God. Do not fail to obey his commands, laws and rules. I am giving them to you today."
Deuteronomy,8,12,You will eat all you want. You will build nice houses and live in them.
Deuteronomy,8,13,Your herds of cattle and flocks of sheep will grow large. Your silver and gold will grow. You will have more of everything.
Deuteronomy,8,14,"Then your heart will become proud. You will forget the Lord your God. He brought you out of the land of Egypt, where you were slaves."
Deuteronomy,8,15,He led you through the large and terrible desert. It was dry and had no water. It had poisonous snakes and stinging insects. He gave you water from a solid rock.
Deuteronomy,8,16,He gave you manna to eat in the desert. Manna was something your ancestors had never seen. He did this to take away your pride and to test you. He did it so things would go well for you in the end.
Deuteronomy,8,17,"You might say to yourself, “I am rich because of my own strength and power.”"
Deuteronomy,8,18,But remember the Lord your God! It is he who gives you the power to become rich. He keeps the agreement he promised to your ancestors. So it is today.
Deuteronomy,8,19,"Never forget the Lord your God. Do not follow other gods. Do not worship them. Do not bow down to them. If you do, I warn you today that you will be destroyed."
Deuteronomy,8,20,The Lord destroyed the other nations for you. And you can be destroyed the same way if you do not obey the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,9,1,"Listen, Israel. You will soon cross the Jordan River. You will go in to force out nations that are bigger and stronger than you. They have large cities with walls up to the sky."
Deuteronomy,9,2,The people there are Anakites. They are strong and tall. You know about them. You have heard it said: “No one can stop the Anakites.”
Deuteronomy,9,3,But today remember that the Lord your God goes in before you. He will destroy them like a fire that burns things up. He will defeat them ahead of you. And you will force them out. You will destroy them quickly. It will happen just as the Lord has said.
Deuteronomy,9,4,"The Lord your God will force those nations out ahead of you. After that, don’t say to yourself, “The Lord brought me here. I own this land because I am so good.” No! It is because these nations are evil. That is why the Lord will force them out ahead of you."
Deuteronomy,9,5,"You are going in to own the land. But it is not because you are good and honest. It is because these nations are evil. That is why the Lord your God will force them out ahead of you. The Lord will keep his promise to your ancestors, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
Deuteronomy,9,6,The Lord your God is giving you this good land to own. But know this: It is not because you are good. You are a stubborn people.
Deuteronomy,9,7,Remember this. Do not forget it. You made the Lord your God angry in the desert. You would not obey the Lord from the day you left Egypt until you arrived here.
Deuteronomy,9,8,At Mount Sinai you made the Lord angry. He was angry enough to destroy you.
Deuteronomy,9,9,I went up on the mountain to receive the stone tablets. The tablets were the agreement the Lord had made with you. I stayed on the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights. I did not eat bread or drink water.
Deuteronomy,9,10,The Lord gave me two stone tablets. God had written on them with his own finger. On them were all the commands of the Lord. He gave them to you on the mountain out of the fire. This was on the day you were gathered there.
Deuteronomy,9,11,Then the 40 days and 40 nights were over. And the Lord gave me the two stone tablets. Those tablets had the agreement on them.
Deuteronomy,9,12,"Then the Lord told me, “Get up. Go down quickly from here. The people you brought out from Egypt are ruining themselves. They have quickly turned away from what I commanded. They have made an idol for themselves.”"
Deuteronomy,9,13,"The Lord said to me, “I have watched these people. They are very stubborn!"
Deuteronomy,9,14,Get away. I will destroy them. I will make the whole world forget who they are. Then I will make another nation from you. It will be bigger and stronger than they are.”
Deuteronomy,9,15,So I turned and came down the mountain. The mountain was burning with fire. And the two stone tablets with the agreement were in my hands.
Deuteronomy,9,16,"When I looked, I saw you had sinned against the Lord your God. You had made an idol in the shape of a calf. You had quickly turned away from what the Lord had told you to do."
Deuteronomy,9,17,So I took the two stone tablets and threw them down. I broke them into pieces right in front of you.
Deuteronomy,9,18,Then I again bowed facedown on the ground before the Lord. I did this for 40 days and 40 nights. I did not eat bread or drink water. You had sinned by doing what the Lord said was evil. You made him angry.
Deuteronomy,9,19,I was afraid of the Lord’s anger and rage. He was angry enough with you to destroy you. But the Lord listened to me again.
Deuteronomy,9,20,"And the Lord was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him. But then I prayed for Aaron, too."
Deuteronomy,9,21,I took that sinful calf idol you had made. And I burned it in the fire. I crushed it into a powder like dust. And I threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain.
Deuteronomy,9,22,"You also made the Lord angry at Taberah, Massah and Kibroth Hattaavah."
Deuteronomy,9,23,"Then the Lord sent you away from Kadesh Barnea. He said, “Go up and take the land I have given you.” But you would not obey the command of the Lord your God. You did not trust him or obey him."
Deuteronomy,9,24,You have refused to obey the Lord as long as I have known you.
Deuteronomy,9,25,The Lord had said he would destroy you. So I threw myself down in front of him for those 40 days and 40 nights.
Deuteronomy,9,26,"I prayed to the Lord. I said, “Lord God, do not destroy your people. They are your own people. You freed them and brought them out of Egypt by your great power and strength."
Deuteronomy,9,27,"Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Don’t look at how stubborn these people are. Don’t look at their sin and evil."
Deuteronomy,9,28,"Otherwise, Egypt will say, ‘The Lord was not able to take his people into the land he promised them. He hated them. So he took them into the desert to kill them.’"
Deuteronomy,9,29,"But they are your people, Lord. They are your own people. You brought them out of Egypt with your great power and strength.”"
Deuteronomy,10,1,"At that time the Lord said to me, “Cut two stone tablets like the first ones. Then come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden ark."
Deuteronomy,10,2,"I will write on the tablets the same words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Put the new tablets in the ark.”"
Deuteronomy,10,3,So I made the ark out of acacia wood. And I cut out two stone tablets like the first ones. Then I went up on the mountain. I had the two tablets in my hands.
Deuteronomy,10,4,The Lord wrote the same things on these tablets he had written before. He wrote the Ten Commandments. He had told them to you on the mountain from the fire. This was on the day you were gathered there. And the Lord gave them to me.
Deuteronomy,10,5,Then I turned and came down the mountain. I put the tablets in the ark I had made. That is what the Lord had commanded. The tablets are still there in the ark.
Deuteronomy,10,6,(The people of Israel went from the wells of the Jaakanites to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried. Aaron’s son Eleazar became priest in Aaron’s place.
Deuteronomy,10,7,"From Moserah they went to Gudgodah. From Gudgodah they went to Jotbathah, a place with streams of water."
Deuteronomy,10,8,At that time the Lord chose the tribe of Levi. They were to carry the Ark of the Covenant with the Lord. They were to serve the Lord. They were to bless the people in the Lord’s name. They still do this today.
Deuteronomy,10,9,"That is why the Levites did not receive any land to own. Instead, they received the Lord himself as their gift. This is what the Lord your God told them.)"
Deuteronomy,10,10,I stayed on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights just like the first time. And the Lord listened to me this time also. He did not want to destroy you.
Deuteronomy,10,11,"The Lord said to me, “Go. Lead the people. They will go in and take the land I promised their ancestors.”"
Deuteronomy,10,12,"Now, Israel, this is what the Lord wants you to do. Respect the Lord your God. Do what he has told you to do. Love him. Serve the Lord your God with your whole being."
Deuteronomy,10,13,And obey the Lord’s commands and laws. I am giving them to you today for your own good.
Deuteronomy,10,14,"The Lord owns the world and everything in it. The heavens, even the highest heavens, are his."
Deuteronomy,10,15,"But the Lord cared for and loved your ancestors. And he chose you, their descendants. He chose you over all the other nations. And it is this way today."
Deuteronomy,10,16,Give yourselves to serving the Lord. Do not be stubborn any longer.
Deuteronomy,10,17,The Lord your God is God of all gods. He is the Lord of all lords. He is the great God. He is strong and wonderful. He does not take sides. And he will not be talked into doing evil.
Deuteronomy,10,18,He helps orphans and widows. He loves foreigners. He gives them food and clothes.
Deuteronomy,10,19,"You also must love foreigners, because you were foreigners in Egypt."
Deuteronomy,10,20,Respect the Lord your God and serve him. Be loyal to him. Make your promises in his name.
Deuteronomy,10,21,You should praise him. He is your God. He has done great and wonderful things for you. You have seen them with your own eyes.
Deuteronomy,10,22,There were only 70 of your ancestors when they went down to Egypt. Now the Lord your God has made you as many as the stars in the sky.
Deuteronomy,11,1,"Love the Lord your God. Obey his orders, rules, laws and commands."
Deuteronomy,11,2,"Remember today it was not your children who saw and felt the correction of the Lord your God. They did not see his majesty, his power and his strength."
Deuteronomy,11,3,They did not see his signs and the things he did in Egypt to the king and his whole country.
Deuteronomy,11,4,"They did not see what he did to the Egyptian army, its horses and chariots. He drowned them in the Red Sea when they were chasing you. The Lord ruined them forever."
Deuteronomy,11,5,They did not see what he did for you in the desert until you arrived here.
Deuteronomy,11,6,"They did not see what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab the Reubenite. The ground opened up and swallowed them, their families and their tents. And it swallowed up everyone who stood with them in Israel."
Deuteronomy,11,7,It was you who saw all these great things the Lord has done.
Deuteronomy,11,8,So obey all the commands I am giving you today. Then you will be strong. Then you can go in and take the land you are going to own.
Deuteronomy,11,9,Then you will live a long time in that land. The Lord promised to give it to your ancestors and their descendants. It is a land where much food grows.
Deuteronomy,11,10,"The land you are going to take is not like Egypt, where you were. There you had to plant your seed. Then you had to water it, like a vegetable garden, by using your feet."
Deuteronomy,11,11,But you will soon cross the Jordan River and take the land. It is a land of hills and valleys. It drinks rain from heaven.
Deuteronomy,11,12,It is a land the Lord your God loves. His eyes are on it continually. He watches it from the beginning of the year to the end.
Deuteronomy,11,13,Carefully obey the commands I am giving you today. Love the Lord your God. Serve him with your whole being.
Deuteronomy,11,14,"Then he will send rain on your land at the right time, in the fall and spring. You will be able to gather your grain, new wine and oil."
Deuteronomy,11,15,He will put grass in the fields for your cattle. You will have plenty to eat.
Deuteronomy,11,16,Be careful. Don’t be fooled. Don’t turn away and serve other gods. Don’t worship them.
Deuteronomy,11,17,"If you do, the Lord will become angry with you. He will shut the heavens so it will not rain. Then the land will not grow crops. And you will soon die in the good land the Lord is giving you."
Deuteronomy,11,18,Remember my words in your hearts and souls. Write them down and tie them to your hands as a sign. Tie them on your foreheads to remind you.
Deuteronomy,11,19,Teach them well to your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and walk along the road. Talk about them when you lie down and when you get up.
Deuteronomy,11,20,Write them on your doors and gates.
Deuteronomy,11,21,Then both you and your children will live a long time in the land. This is the land the Lord promised your ancestors. You will live there for as long as the skies are above the earth.
Deuteronomy,11,22,Be careful to obey every command I am giving you to follow. Love the Lord your God. Do what he has told you to do. And be loyal to him.
Deuteronomy,11,23,Then the Lord will force all those nations out of the land ahead of you. And you will take the land from nations that are bigger and stronger than you.
Deuteronomy,11,24,Everywhere you step will be yours. Your land will go from the desert to Lebanon. And it will go from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea.
Deuteronomy,11,25,No one will be able to stop you. The Lord your God will do what he promised. He will make the people afraid everywhere you go.
Deuteronomy,11,26,"See, today I am letting you choose a blessing or a curse."
Deuteronomy,11,27,You will be blessed if you obey the commands of the Lord your God. I am giving them to you today.
Deuteronomy,11,28,But you will be cursed if you disobey the commands of the Lord your God. So do not disobey the commands I am giving you today. Do not worship other gods you do not know.
Deuteronomy,11,29,The Lord your God will bring you into the land you will own. Then you are to announce the blessings from Mount Gerizim. Announce the curses from Mount Ebal.
Deuteronomy,11,30,"These mountains are on the other side of the Jordan River. They are west, toward the sunset. They are near the great trees of Moreh. They are in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Jordan Valley opposite Gilgal."
Deuteronomy,11,31,You will soon cross the Jordan River. You will enter and take the land the Lord your God is giving you. You will take it over and live there.
Deuteronomy,11,32,Then be careful to obey all the commands and laws I am giving you today.
Deuteronomy,12,1,These are the commands and laws you must carefully obey in the land the Lord your God is giving you. Obey them as long as you live in the land.
Deuteronomy,12,2,You will inherit the lands of these nations. You must completely destroy all the places where they serve their gods. These places are on high mountains and hills and under every green tree.
Deuteronomy,12,3,Tear down their altars. Smash their holy stone pillars. Burn their Asherah idols. Cut down their idols. Destroy their names from those places.
Deuteronomy,12,4,Don’t worship the Lord your God that way.
Deuteronomy,12,5,But look for the place the Lord your God will choose. He will choose a place among your tribes where he is to be worshiped. Go there.
Deuteronomy,12,6,Bring to that place your burnt offerings and sacrifices. Bring a tenth of what you gain and your special gifts. Bring what you have promised and the special gifts you want to give the Lord. And bring the first animals born to your herds and flocks.
Deuteronomy,12,7,There you will be together with the Lord your God. There you and your families will eat. And you will enjoy all the good things for which you have worked. The Lord your God has blessed you.
Deuteronomy,12,8,Do not worship the way we have been doing today. Each person does what he thinks is right.
Deuteronomy,12,9,You have not yet come to a resting place. The Lord your God will give you your own land.
Deuteronomy,12,10,But you will soon cross the Jordan River. And you will live in the land the Lord your God is giving you to own. And he will give you rest from all your enemies. You will live in safety.
Deuteronomy,12,11,"Then the Lord your God will choose a place where he is to be worshiped. To that place you must bring everything I tell you: your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your offerings of a tenth of what you gain, your special gifts and all your best things you promised to the Lord."
Deuteronomy,12,12,"There rejoice before the Lord your God. Everyone should rejoice: you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns, who have no land of their own."
Deuteronomy,12,13,Be careful. Don’t sacrifice your burnt offerings just anywhere you please.
Deuteronomy,12,14,Offer them only in the place the Lord will choose. He will choose a place in one of your tribes. And there you must do everything I am commanding you.
Deuteronomy,12,15,"But you may kill your animals in any of your towns. And you may eat as much of the meat as you want. Eat it as if it were a deer or a gazelle. This is the blessing the Lord your God is giving you. Anyone, clean or unclean, may eat this meat."
Deuteronomy,12,16,But do not eat the blood. Pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,12,17,"Do not eat in your own towns what belongs to the Lord: one-tenth of your grain, new wine or oil; the first animals born to your herds or flocks; whatever you have promised to give; the special gifts you want to give to the Lord, or any other gifts."
Deuteronomy,12,18,"Eat these things when you are together with the Lord. Eat them in the place the Lord your God chooses to be worshiped. Everyone must do this: you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns. Rejoice in the Lord’s presence about the things you have worked for."
Deuteronomy,12,19,Be careful not to forget the Levites as long as you live in the land.
Deuteronomy,12,20,"The Lord your God will enlarge your country as he has promised. And you will want some meat. You will say, “I want some meat.” Eat as much meat as you want."
Deuteronomy,12,21,"The Lord your God will choose a place where he is to be worshiped. But it may be too far away from you. If it is, you may kill animals from your herds and flocks. The Lord has given them to you. I have commanded that you may do this. You may eat as much of them as you want in your own towns."
Deuteronomy,12,22,Eat them as you would eat gazelle or deer meat. Both clean and unclean people may eat this meat.
Deuteronomy,12,23,But be sure you don’t eat the blood. The life is in the blood. Don’t eat the life with the meat.
Deuteronomy,12,24,Don’t eat the blood. Pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,12,25,Don’t eat it. Then things will go well for you and your children. You will be doing what the Lord says is right.
Deuteronomy,12,26,Take your holy things and the things you have promised to give. And go to the place the Lord will choose.
Deuteronomy,12,27,Present your burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord your God. Offer both the meat and the blood. The blood of your sacrifices should be poured beside the altar. But you may eat the meat.
Deuteronomy,12,28,Be careful to obey all the rules I am giving you. Then things will always go well for you and your children. You will be doing what the Lord your God says is good and right.
Deuteronomy,12,29,You will enter the land and take it away from the nations there. The Lord your God will destroy those nations ahead of you. You will force them out and live in their land.
Deuteronomy,12,30,"They will be destroyed for you. Be careful not to be trapped by asking about their gods. Don’t say, “How do these nations worship? I will do the same.”"
Deuteronomy,12,31,Don’t worship the Lord your God that way. The Lord hates the evil ways they worship their gods. They even burn their sons and daughters as sacrifices to their gods!
Deuteronomy,12,32,Be sure to do everything I have commanded you. Do not add anything to it. And do not take anything away from it.
Deuteronomy,13,1,A prophet or someone who tells the future with dreams might come to you. He might say he will show you a miracle or a sign.
Deuteronomy,13,2,"The miracle or sign might even happen. Then he might say, “Let’s serve other gods.” (These are gods you have not known.) “And let’s worship them.”"
Deuteronomy,13,3,But you must not listen to that prophet or dreamer. The Lord your God is testing you. He is finding out if you love him with your whole being.
Deuteronomy,13,4,Serve only the Lord your God. Respect him. Keep his commands and obey him. Serve him and be loyal to him.
Deuteronomy,13,5,That prophet or dreamer must be killed. He said you should turn against the Lord your God. The Lord brought you out of Egypt. He saved you from the land where you were slaves. That prophet tried to turn you from doing what the Lord your God commanded you to do. You must get rid of the evil among you.
Deuteronomy,13,6,"Some relative might try to lead you to serve other gods. It might be your brother, your son or daughter or the wife you love. Or it might be a close friend. He might say, “Let’s go and worship other gods.” (These are gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known."
Deuteronomy,13,7,"They are gods of the people who live around you. Some are nearby, and some are far away. They are from one end of the land to the other.)"
Deuteronomy,13,8,Do not give in to him. Do not listen. Do not feel sorry for him. Do not let him go free or protect him.
Deuteronomy,13,9,You must put him to death. You must be the first one to start to kill him. Then everyone else must join in.
Deuteronomy,13,10,"You must throw stones at him until he dies. He tried to turn you away from the Lord your God. The Lord brought you out of the land of Egypt, where you were slaves."
Deuteronomy,13,11,Then everyone in Israel will hear about this. And they will be afraid. No one among you will ever do such an evil thing again.
Deuteronomy,13,12,The Lord your God is giving you cities in which to live. You might hear something about one of them. Someone might say
Deuteronomy,13,13,"that evil men have moved in among you. And they might lead the people of that city away from God. They might say, “Let’s go and worship other gods.” (These are gods you have not known.)"
Deuteronomy,13,14,Then you must ask about it. Look into the matter and check carefully. It might be true. It may be proved that a terrible thing has happened among you.
Deuteronomy,13,15,"If it has, then you must kill with a sword everyone who lives in that city. Destroy the city completely. Kill everyone in it, as well as the animals, with a sword."
Deuteronomy,13,16,Gather up everything those people owned. Put it in the middle of the city square. Then completely burn the city and everything they owned. It will be a burnt offering to the Lord your God. That city should never be rebuilt. Let it be ruined forever.
Deuteronomy,13,17,Don’t keep any of the things found in that city for yourselves. Then the Lord will not be angry anymore. He will give you mercy. He will feel sorry for you. And he will make your nation grow larger. He promised this to your ancestors.
Deuteronomy,13,18,You will have obeyed the Lord your God. You will be keeping all his commands. I am giving them to you today. And you will be doing what the Lord says is right.
Deuteronomy,14,1,"You are the children of the Lord your God. When someone dies, do not cut yourselves or shave your heads to show your sadness."
Deuteronomy,14,2,You are holy people. You belong to the Lord your God. He has chosen you from all the people on earth to be his very own.
Deuteronomy,14,3,Do not eat anything the Lord hates.
Deuteronomy,14,4,"These are the animals you may eat: ox, sheep, goats,"
Deuteronomy,14,5,"deer, gazelle, roe deer, wild goats, ibex, antelope and mountain sheep."
Deuteronomy,14,6,You may eat any animal that has a split hoof and chews the cud.
Deuteronomy,14,7,"But you may not eat camels, rabbits or rock badgers. These animals chew the cud, but their feet are not divided. So they are unclean for you."
Deuteronomy,14,8,"Pigs are also unclean for you. They have split hooves, but they do not chew the cud. Do not eat their meat or touch their dead bodies."
Deuteronomy,14,9,There are many things that live in the water. You may eat anything that has fins and scales.
Deuteronomy,14,10,But do not eat anything that does not have fins and scales. It is unclean for you.
Deuteronomy,14,11,You may eat any clean bird.
Deuteronomy,14,12,"But do not eat these birds: eagles, vultures, black vultures,"
Deuteronomy,14,13,"red kites, falcons, any kind of kite,"
Deuteronomy,14,14,"any kind of raven,"
Deuteronomy,14,15,"horned owls, screech owls, seagulls, any kind of hawk,"
Deuteronomy,14,16,"little owls, great owls, white owls,"
Deuteronomy,14,17,"desert owls, ospreys, cormorants,"
Deuteronomy,14,18,"storks, any kind of heron, the hoopoes or bats."
Deuteronomy,14,19,All insects with wings are unclean for you. Do not eat them.
Deuteronomy,14,20,Other things with wings are clean. You may eat them.
Deuteronomy,14,21,Do not eat anything you find that is already dead. You may give it to a foreigner living in your town. He may eat it. Or you may sell it to a foreigner. But you are holy people. You belong to the Lord your God. Do not cook a baby goat in its mother’s milk.
Deuteronomy,14,22,Be sure to save one-tenth of all your crops each year.
Deuteronomy,14,23,"Take it to the place the Lord your God will choose where he is to be worshiped. There you will be together with the Lord. There eat the tenth of your grain, new wine and oil. And eat the animals born first to your herds and flocks. Then you will learn to respect the Lord your God always."
Deuteronomy,14,24,But the place the Lord will choose to be worshiped might be too far away. And he may have blessed you so much you cannot carry a tenth.
Deuteronomy,14,25,"If so, exchange your one-tenth for silver. Then take the silver with you to the place the Lord your God shall choose."
Deuteronomy,14,26,"Use the silver to buy anything you wish. You may buy cattle, sheep, wine, beer or anything you wish. Then you and your family will eat and celebrate there before the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,14,27,Do not forget the Levites in your town. They have no land of their own among you.
Deuteronomy,14,28,"At the end of every third year, everyone should bring one-tenth of that year’s crop. Store it in your towns."
Deuteronomy,14,29,"This is for the Levites so they may eat and be full. (They have no land of their own among you.) It is also for strangers, orphans and widows who live in your towns. All of them may eat and be full. Then the Lord your God will bless you and all the work you do."
Deuteronomy,15,1,"At the end of every seven years, you must forget about collecting what people owe you."
Deuteronomy,15,2,This is how you must do it: Everyone who has loaned money must forget the loan. He must not make his neighbor or brother pay it back. This is the Lord’s time for canceling what people owe.
Deuteronomy,15,3,You may make a foreigner pay what he owes you. But you must not collect what your brother owes you.
Deuteronomy,15,4,But there should be no poor people among you. The Lord your God will richly bless you in the land he is giving you to own.
Deuteronomy,15,5,He will bless you if you obey him completely. But you must be careful to obey all the commands I am giving you today.
Deuteronomy,15,6,The Lord your God will bless you as he promised. You will lend to other nations. But you will not need to borrow from them. You will rule over many nations. But none will rule over you.
Deuteronomy,15,7,There might be a poor man among you. He might be in one of the towns of the land the Lord your God is giving you. Do not be selfish or greedy toward your poor brother.
Deuteronomy,15,8,But give freely to him. Freely lend him whatever he needs.
Deuteronomy,15,9,"Beware of evil thoughts. Don’t think, “The seventh year is near. It’s the year to forget what people owe.” You might be mean to your needy brother. You might not give him anything. Then he will complain to the Lord about you. And the Lord will find you guilty of sin."
Deuteronomy,15,10,Give freely to the poor person. Do not wish that you didn’t have to give. The Lord your God will bless your work and everything you touch.
Deuteronomy,15,11,There will always be poor people in the land. So I command you to give freely to your brothers. Give freely to the poor and needy in your land.
Deuteronomy,15,12,One of your own people might sell himself to you as a slave. It may be a Hebrew man or woman. That person will serve you for six years. The seventh year you must let him go free.
Deuteronomy,15,13,"And when you let him go, don’t send him away without anything."
Deuteronomy,15,14,"Give him some of your sheep, your grain and your wine. Give to him as the Lord has given to you."
Deuteronomy,15,15,Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. And the Lord your God saved you. That is why I am commanding this to you today.
Deuteronomy,15,16,"But your slave might say to you, “I don’t want to leave you.” He might love you and your family. He might have a good life with you."
Deuteronomy,15,17,"If he does this, stick an awl through his ear into the door. He will be your slave for life. Also do this to a woman slave."
Deuteronomy,15,18,"Do not think of it as a hard thing when you let your slave go free. After all, he served you six years. You paid him only half what a hired person would cost. The Lord your God will bless you in everything you do."
Deuteronomy,15,19,Save all the first male animals born to your herds and flocks. They are for the Lord your God. Do not work the first calf born to your oxen. And do not cut off the wool from the first lamb born to your sheep.
Deuteronomy,15,20,Each year you and your family are to eat these animals. Eat them in the presence of the Lord your God. Eat them in the place he will choose to be worshiped.
Deuteronomy,15,21,An animal might have something wrong with it. It might be crippled or blind. It might have some other thing wrong with it. Do not sacrifice it to the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,15,22,But you may eat that animal in your own town. Both clean and unclean people may eat it. It would be like eating a gazelle or a deer.
Deuteronomy,15,23,But don’t eat its blood. Pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy,16,1,Celebrate the Passover of the Lord your God during the month of Abib. It was during Abib that he brought you out of Egypt at night.
Deuteronomy,16,2,Offer a sacrifice for the Passover to the Lord your God. It should be an animal from your flock or herd. Offer it at the place the Lord will choose to be worshiped.
Deuteronomy,16,3,Do not eat it with bread made with yeast. But for seven days eat bread made without yeast. This is the bread of suffering because you left Egypt in a hurry. So all your life you will remember the time you left Egypt.
Deuteronomy,16,4,There must be no yeast anywhere in your land for seven days. Offer the sacrifice on the evening of the first day. Eat all the meat before morning. Do not leave it overnight.
Deuteronomy,16,5,Do not offer the Passover sacrifice in just any town the Lord your God gives you.
Deuteronomy,16,6,Offer it in the place he will choose to be worshiped. Offer it in the evening as the sun goes down. That is when you left Egypt.
Deuteronomy,16,7,Roast the meat. Then eat it at the place the Lord your God will choose. The next morning go back to your tents.
Deuteronomy,16,8,Eat bread made without yeast for six days. On the seventh day have a special meeting for the Lord your God. Do not work that day.
Deuteronomy,16,9,Count seven weeks from the time you begin to harvest the grain.
Deuteronomy,16,10,Then celebrate the Feast of Weeks for the Lord your God. Bring him an offering as a special gift to him. Give to him just as he has blessed you.
Deuteronomy,16,11,"Rejoice before the Lord your God. Rejoice at the place he will choose to be worshiped. Everybody should rejoice: you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, the Levites in your town, the strangers, orphans and widows living among you."
Deuteronomy,16,12,Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. And carefully obey all these laws.
Deuteronomy,16,13,Celebrate the Feast of Shelters for seven days. Do it after you have gathered your harvest from the threshing floor and winepress.
Deuteronomy,16,14,"Everybody should rejoice at your Feast: you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, the Levites and strangers who live in your towns, orphans and widows in your towns."
Deuteronomy,16,15,Celebrate the Feast to the Lord your God for seven days. Celebrate it at the place he will choose. The Lord your God will bless all your harvest. He will bless all the work you do. And you will be completely happy.
Deuteronomy,16,16,"All your men must come before the Lord three times a year. They must come to the place he will choose. They must come at these times: the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Shelters. No man should come before the Lord without a gift."
Deuteronomy,16,17,Each of you must bring a gift. It should show how much the Lord your God has blessed you.
Deuteronomy,16,18,Appoint judges and officers for your tribes. Appoint them in every town the Lord your God is giving you. And they must judge the people fairly.
Deuteronomy,16,19,Do not judge unfairly or take sides. Do not let people pay you to make wrong decisions. That kind of payment makes wise people seem blind. And it changes the words of good people.
Deuteronomy,16,20,Always do what is right. Then you will live and own the land the Lord your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy,16,21,Do not set up a wooden Asherah idol next to the altar you build for the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,16,22,And do not set up holy stone pillars. The Lord your God hates them.
Deuteronomy,17,1,An ox or sheep might have something wrong with it. Do not offer it as a sacrifice to the Lord your God. He would hate that.
Deuteronomy,17,2,A man or woman might be found doing something evil in one of the towns the Lord gave you. That man or woman is breaking his agreement.
Deuteronomy,17,3,"That person may have served other gods. He may have bowed down to them, to the sun or moon or stars of the sky. I have commanded that should not be done."
Deuteronomy,17,4,"If someone has told you about it, you must look into the matter. It might be true. A terrible thing may have happened in Israel."
Deuteronomy,17,5,"If it is true, take the man or woman who has done the evil thing to the city gate. Throw stones at that person until he dies."
Deuteronomy,17,6,"There must be two or three witnesses that he did it. Then the person should be put to death. But if there is only one witness, the person should not be put to death."
Deuteronomy,17,7,The witnesses must be the first to throw stones at the person. Then everyone else will follow. You must get rid of the evil among you.
Deuteronomy,17,8,"Some cases that come before you may be too difficult to judge. It may be a case of murder, quarreling or attack. Take these cases to the place the Lord your God will choose."
Deuteronomy,17,9,"Go to the priests who are Levites. And go to the judge who is on duty at that time. Ask them about the case, and they will decide."
Deuteronomy,17,10,You must follow the decision they give you. They will be at the place the Lord your God will choose. Be careful to do everything they tell you.
Deuteronomy,17,11,Follow the teachings they give you. Do whatever they decide. Do exactly what they tell you.
Deuteronomy,17,12,The person who does not show respect for the judge or priest must be put to death. They are there serving the Lord your God. You must get rid of that evil from Israel.
Deuteronomy,17,13,Then everyone will hear about this. And they will be afraid. They will not show disrespect anymore.
Deuteronomy,17,14,"You will enter the land the Lord your God is giving you. You will take it as your own and live in it. Then you will say, “Let’s appoint a king over us like the nations all around us.”"
Deuteronomy,17,15,Be sure to appoint over you the king the Lord your God chooses. He must be one of your own people. Do not appoint a foreigner as your king. He is not a fellow Israelite.
Deuteronomy,17,16,"The king must not have too many horses for himself. He must not send people to Egypt to get more horses. The Lord has told you, “Don’t return that way again.”"
Deuteronomy,17,17,"The king must not have many wives. If he does, his heart will be led away from God. He must not have too much silver and gold."
Deuteronomy,17,18,"When he becomes king, he should write a copy of the teachings on a scroll for himself. He should copy it from the priests and Levites."
Deuteronomy,17,19,He should keep it with him all the time. He should read from it every day of his life. Then he will learn to respect the Lord his God. And he will obey all the teachings and commands.
Deuteronomy,17,20,He should not think he is better than his brothers. He must not stop obeying the law in any way. Then he and his descendants will rule the kingdom for a long time.
Deuteronomy,18,1,The priests are from the tribe of Levi. That tribe will not receive a share of the land with the Israelites. They will eat the offerings made to the Lord by fire. That is their share.
Deuteronomy,18,2,They will not inherit any of the land like their brothers. They will inherit the Lord himself. This is what he promised them.
Deuteronomy,18,3,"When you offer a bull or sheep as a sacrifice, you must share with the priests. Give them the shoulder, the cheeks and the inner organs."
Deuteronomy,18,4,"Give them the first of your grain, new wine and oil. Give them the first wool you cut from your sheep."
Deuteronomy,18,5,The Lord your God has chosen the priests and their descendants out of all your tribes. They are to stand and serve the Lord always.
Deuteronomy,18,6,A Levite might move from one of your towns anywhere in Israel where he lives. He is sincere and comes to the place the Lord will choose.
Deuteronomy,18,7,He may serve the Lord his God. He will be like his fellow Levites who serve there before the Lord.
Deuteronomy,18,8,They all will have an equal share of the food. This is separate from what he has received from the sale of family possessions.
Deuteronomy,18,9,You will enter the land the Lord your God is giving you. But don’t learn to do the terrible things the other nations do.
Deuteronomy,18,10,Don’t let anyone among you offer his son or daughter as a sacrifice in the fire. Don’t let anyone use magic or witchcraft. No one should try to explain the meaning of signs.
Deuteronomy,18,11,Don’t let anyone try to control others with magic. Don’t let them be mediums or try to talk with the spirits of dead people.
Deuteronomy,18,12,The Lord hates anyone who does these things. The other nations do these things. That is why the Lord your God will force them out of the land ahead of you.
Deuteronomy,18,13,You must be innocent in the presence of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy,18,14,The nations you will force out listen to people who use magic and witchcraft. But the Lord your God will not let you do those things.
Deuteronomy,18,15,The Lord your God will give you a prophet like me. He will be one of your own people. Listen to him.
Deuteronomy,18,16,"This is what you asked the Lord your God to do. You were gathered at Mount Sinai. You said, “Don’t make us listen to the voice of the Lord our God again. Don’t make us look at this terrible fire anymore. We will die.”"
Deuteronomy,18,17,"So the Lord said to me, “What they have said is good."
Deuteronomy,18,18,So I will give them a prophet like you. He will be one of their own people. I will tell him what to say. And he will tell them everything I command.
Deuteronomy,18,19,This prophet will speak for me. Anyone who does not listen when he speaks will answer to me.
Deuteronomy,18,20,But a prophet might say something I did not tell him to say. And he might say he is speaking for me. Or a prophet might speak in the name of other gods. That prophet must be killed.”
Deuteronomy,18,21,"You might be thinking, “How can we know if a message is not from the Lord?”"
Deuteronomy,18,22,"What a prophet says in the name of the Lord might not happen. If it doesn’t, it is not the Lord’s message. That prophet was speaking his own ideas. Don’t be afraid of him."
Deuteronomy,19,1,The Lord your God is giving you land that belongs to other nations. He will destroy those nations. You will force them out and live in their cities and houses.
Deuteronomy,19,2,Then choose three cities. They must be in the middle of the land the Lord your God is giving you to own.
Deuteronomy,19,3,Build roads to those cities. And divide the land the Lord is giving you into three parts. Then someone who kills another person may run to these cities.
Deuteronomy,19,4,This is the rule for someone who kills another person. He may run to one of these cities to save his life. But he must have killed his neighbor without meaning to kill him. He did not hate his neighbor.
Deuteronomy,19,5,A man might go into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood. The man swings his ax to cut down a tree. But the ax head flies off the handle. It hits his neighbor and kills him. The man who killed him may run to one of these cities to save his life.
Deuteronomy,19,6,"Otherwise, the dead man’s relative who has the duty of punishing a murderer might be angry and chase him. And the relative might catch him if the city is far away. The relative might kill the man. But the man should not be killed because he did not mean to kill his neighbor."
Deuteronomy,19,7,This is why I command you to choose these three cities.
Deuteronomy,20,1,"When you go to war against your enemies, you might see horses and chariots. Their army might be bigger than yours. But don’t be afraid of them. The Lord your God will be with you. He brought you out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,20,2,The priest must come and speak to the army before you go into battle.
Deuteronomy,20,3,"He should say, “Listen, Israel! Today you are going into battle against your enemies. Don’t lose your courage or be afraid. Don’t panic or be frightened."
Deuteronomy,20,4,The Lord your God goes with you. He will fight for you against your enemies. And he will save you.”
Deuteronomy,20,5,"The officers should say to the army, “Has anyone built a new house but not given it to God? He may go home. He might die in battle. Then someone else would get to give his house to God."
Deuteronomy,20,6,Has anyone planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy it? He may go home. He might die in battle. Then someone else would enjoy his vineyard.
Deuteronomy,20,7,Is any man engaged to a woman and not yet married to her? He may go home. He might die in battle. Then someone else would marry her.”
Deuteronomy,20,8,"Then the officers should also say, “Is anyone here afraid? Has anyone lost his courage? He may go home. Then he will not cause others to lose their courage, too.”"
Deuteronomy,20,9,"When the officers finish speaking to the army, they should appoint commanders to lead it."
Deuteronomy,20,10,"You will march up to attack a city. First, make them an offer of peace."
Deuteronomy,20,11,"They might accept your offer and open their gates to you. If that happens, all the people of that city will become your slaves. They will work for you."
Deuteronomy,20,12,But they might not make peace with you. They might fight you in battle. Then you should surround that city.
Deuteronomy,20,13,The Lord your God will give you the city. Then kill all the men with your swords.
Deuteronomy,20,14,You may take everything else in the city for yourselves. Take the women and children and animals. And you may use these things the Lord your God gives you from your enemies.
Deuteronomy,20,15,Do this to all the cities that are far away. They do not belong to the nations nearby.
Deuteronomy,20,16,But leave nothing alive in the cities of the land. This is the land the Lord your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy,20,17,"Completely destroy these people: the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. The Lord your God has commanded you to do this."
Deuteronomy,20,18,"Otherwise, they will teach you what they do for their gods. And if you do these terrible things, you will sin against the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy,20,19,"You might surround and attack a city for a long time, trying to capture it. But do not destroy its trees with an ax. You can eat the fruit from the trees. Do not cut them down. These trees are not the enemy. So don’t make war against them."
Deuteronomy,20,20,But you may cut down trees that you know are not fruit trees. You may use them to build devices to attack the city walls. You may do this until the city is captured.
Deuteronomy,21,1,Someone might be found murdered. He might be lying in a field in the land the Lord your God is giving you to own. And no one knows who killed him.
Deuteronomy,21,2,Your elders and judges should go to where he was found. And they should measure how far it is to the nearby cities.
Deuteronomy,21,3,The elders of the city nearest the body are responsible. They must take a young cow that has never worked or worn a yoke.
Deuteronomy,21,4,And they must lead her down to a valley. It must never have been plowed or planted. It must have a stream flowing through it. There they must break the young cow’s neck.
Deuteronomy,21,5,The priests should come forward. They are the sons of Levi. They have been chosen by the Lord your God. They are to serve and give blessings in the Lord’s name. And they are to decide cases of quarreling and attacks.
Deuteronomy,21,6,Then all the elders of the city nearest the murdered man should wash their hands. They should do it over the young cow whose neck was broken in the valley.
Deuteronomy,21,7,They should declare: “We did not kill this man. And we did not see it happen.
Deuteronomy,21,8,"Lord, remove this sin of your people Israel. You have saved them. Don’t blame your people, the Israelites, for this innocent man’s murder.” And so the murder will be paid for."
Deuteronomy,21,9,Then you will have removed from yourselves the guilt of murdering an innocent person. You will be doing what the Lord says is right.
Deuteronomy,21,10,You will go to war against your enemies. The Lord will help you defeat them. You will take them captive.
Deuteronomy,21,11,You might see a beautiful woman among the captives. And you might be attracted to her. You may take her as your wife.
Deuteronomy,21,12,Bring her into your home. She must shave her head and cut her nails.
Deuteronomy,21,13,"She must change out of the clothes she was wearing when you captured her. And she must live in your house and cry for her parents for a month. After that, you may marry her. You will be her husband, and she will be your wife."
Deuteronomy,21,14,But you might not be pleased with her. Then let her go anywhere she wants. You must not sell her for money. You must not make her a slave. You have taken away her honor.
Deuteronomy,21,15,A man may have two wives. He might love one wife but not the other. Both wives might have sons by him. But the older son might be the son of the wife he does not love.
Deuteronomy,21,16,Someday that man must will his property to his sons. But he must not give the son of the wife he loves what belongs to the older son. The older son is the son of the wife the man does not love.
Deuteronomy,21,17,He must agree to give the older son two shares of everything he owns. The older son is from the wife he does not love. That son was the first to prove his father could have children. So he has the rights that belong to the older son.
Deuteronomy,21,18,A man might have a son who is stubborn. The son turns against his father and mother and doesn’t obey them. He will not listen when they correct him.
Deuteronomy,21,19,His parents must take him to the elders at the city gate.
Deuteronomy,21,20,"They will say to the leaders, “Our son is stubborn and turns against us. He will not obey us. He eats too much. And he is always drunk.”"
Deuteronomy,21,21,Then all the men in his town must throw stones at him until he dies. Get rid of the evil among you. All the people of Israel will hear about this and be afraid.
Deuteronomy,21,22,A man might be guilty of a sin worthy of death. He must be put to death and his body displayed on a tree.
Deuteronomy,21,23,But don’t leave his body hanging on the tree overnight. Be sure to bury him that same day. Anyone whose body is displayed on a tree is cursed by God. You must not ruin the land the Lord your God is giving you to own.
Deuteronomy,22,1,You might see your fellow Israelite’s ox or sheep wandering away. Don’t ignore it. Take it back to its owner.
Deuteronomy,22,2,The owner might not live close to you. Or you might not know who he is. Then take the animal home with you. Keep it until the owner comes looking for it. Then give it back to him.
Deuteronomy,22,3,Do the same thing if you find his donkey or coat or anything he lost. Don’t just ignore it.
Deuteronomy,22,4,You might see your fellow Israelite’s donkey or ox fallen on the road. Don’t ignore it. Help him get it up.
Deuteronomy,22,5,A woman must not wear men’s clothes. And a man must not wear women’s clothes. The Lord your God hates anyone who does that.
Deuteronomy,22,6,You might find a bird’s nest by the road. It might be in a tree or on the ground. And the mother bird might be sitting on the young birds or eggs. Do not take the mother bird with the young birds.
Deuteronomy,22,7,You may take the young birds. But you must let the mother bird go free. Then things will go well for you. And you will live a long time.
Deuteronomy,22,8,"When you build a new house, build a wall around the roof. Then you will not be guilty of murder if someone falls off the roof."
Deuteronomy,22,9,"Don’t plant two different kinds of seeds in your vineyard. Otherwise, both crops will be ruined."
Deuteronomy,22,10,Don’t plow with an ox and a donkey tied together.
Deuteronomy,22,11,Don’t wear clothes made of wool and linen woven together.
Deuteronomy,22,12,Tie several pieces of thread together. Then put these tassels on the four corners of your coat.
Deuteronomy,22,13,A man might marry a girl and have intimate relations with her. But he might decide that he does not like her.
Deuteronomy,22,14,"So he might lie about her and give her a bad name. He might say, “I married this woman. But when I had intimate relations with her, I did not find that she was a virgin.”"
Deuteronomy,22,15,Then the girl’s parents must bring proof that she was a virgin. They must bring it to the elders at the city gate.
Deuteronomy,22,16,"The girl’s father will say to the leaders, “I gave my daughter to this man to be his wife. But now he does not want her."
Deuteronomy,22,17,"This man has told lies about my daughter. He has said, ‘I did not find your daughter to be a virgin.’ But here is the proof that my daughter was a virgin.” Then her parents are to show the sheet to the city leaders."
Deuteronomy,22,18,Then the leaders must take the man and punish him.
Deuteronomy,22,19,They must make him pay about two and a half pounds of silver. The silver will go to the girl’s father. This is because the man has given an Israelite girl a bad name. The girl must continue to be the man’s wife. And he may not divorce her as long as he lives.
Deuteronomy,22,20,But the things the husband said about his wife might be true. And there might be no proof that she was a virgin.
Deuteronomy,22,21,"If so, the girl must be brought to the door of her father’s house. Then the men of the town must put her to death by throwing stones at her. She has done a disgraceful thing in Israel. She had physical relations before she was married. You must get rid of the evil among you."
Deuteronomy,22,22,A man might be found committing adultery with another man’s wife. Both the woman and the man who committed adultery with her must die. Get rid of this evil from Israel.
Deuteronomy,22,23,A man might meet a virgin in a city and have physical relations with her. But she might be engaged to another man.
Deuteronomy,22,24,You must take both of them to the city gate. Put them both to death by throwing stones at them. Kill the girl because she was in a city and did not scream for help. And kill the man for having physical relations with another man’s wife. You must get rid of the evil among you.
Deuteronomy,22,25,But a man might meet a girl out in the country. He might force her to have physical relations with him. But she might be engaged to another man. Only the man who forced her to have physical relations with her must be put to death.

Deuteronomy,29,22,"Your children who will come after you will see this. And foreigners from faraway lands will see this. They will see the disasters that come to this land. And they will see the diseases the Lord will send on it. They will say,"
Deuteronomy,29,23,"“The land is nothing but burning cinders and salt. Nothing is planted. Nothing grows. Nothing blooms. It is like Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah and Zeboiim. The Lord destroyed them because he was very angry.”"
Deuteronomy,29,24,"All the other nations will ask, “Why has the Lord done this to the land? Why is he so angry?”"
Deuteronomy,29,25,"And the answer will be, “It is because the people broke the agreement of the Lord, the God of their ancestors. He made it with them when he brought them out of Egypt."
Deuteronomy,29,26,They went and served other gods. They bowed down to gods they did not even know. The Lord did not allow that.
Deuteronomy,29,27,So the Lord became very angry at the land. And he brought all the curses on it that are written in this book.
Deuteronomy,29,28,The Lord became angry and furious with them. So he took them out of their land. And he put them in another land where they are today.”
Deuteronomy,29,29,There are some things the Lord our God has kept secret. But there are some things he has let us know. These things belong to us and our children forever. It is so we will do everything in these teachings.
Deuteronomy,30,1,All these blessings and curses I have said will happen to you. The Lord your God will send you away to other nations. There you will think about these things.
Deuteronomy,30,2,Then you and your children will return to the Lord your God. And you will obey him with your whole being. You will obey everything I command you today.
Deuteronomy,30,3,Then the Lord your God will give you back your riches. He will feel sorry for you. And he will bring you back again from the nations where he sent you.
Deuteronomy,30,4,He may send you to the ends of the earth. But he will gather you. He will bring you back from there.
Deuteronomy,30,5,He will bring you back to the land that belonged to your ancestors. It will be yours. He will give you success. And there will be more of you than there were of your ancestors.
Deuteronomy,30,6,The Lord your God will prepare you and your descendants to serve him. You will love him with your whole being. Then you will live.
Deuteronomy,30,7,The Lord your God will put all these curses on your enemies. They hate you and are cruel to you.
Deuteronomy,30,8,And you will again obey the Lord. You will keep all his commands that I give you today.
Deuteronomy,30,9,"The Lord your God will make you successful in everything you do. You will have many children. Your cattle will have many calves. Your fields will produce good crops. He will again be happy with you, just as he was with your ancestors."
Deuteronomy,30,10,But you must obey the Lord your God. You must obey his commands and rules that are written in this Book of the Teachings. You must follow the Lord your God with your whole being.
Deuteronomy,30,11,This command I give you today is not too hard for you. It is not beyond what you can do.
Deuteronomy,30,12,"It is not up in heaven. You do not have to ask, “Who will go up to heaven and get it for us? Then we can obey it and keep it.”"
Deuteronomy,30,13,"It is not on the other side of the sea. You do not have to ask, “Who will go across the sea and get it? Who will tell it to us? Then we can keep it.”"
Deuteronomy,30,14,"No, the word is very near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart. So, you may obey it."
Deuteronomy,30,15,"Look, today I offer you life and success, death and destruction."
Deuteronomy,30,16,"I command you today to love the Lord your God. Do what he wants you to do. Keep his commands, his rules and his laws. Then you will live and grow in number. And the Lord your God will bless you in the land you are going to take as your own."
Deuteronomy,30,17,But you might turn away from the Lord. You might not obey him. You might be led to bowing down and serving other gods.
Deuteronomy,30,18,I tell you today that you will be destroyed. And you will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan River to enter and own.
Deuteronomy,30,19,"Today I ask heaven and earth to be witnesses. I am offering you life or death, blessings or curses. Now, choose life! Then you and your children may live."
Deuteronomy,30,20,"Love the Lord your God. Obey him. Stay close to him. He is your life. And he will let you live many years in the land. This is the land he promised to give your ancestors Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
Deuteronomy,31,1,Then Moses went and spoke these words to all the Israelites:
Deuteronomy,31,2,“I am now 120 years old. I cannot lead you anymore. The Lord told me I would not cross the Jordan River.
Deuteronomy,31,3,The Lord your God will lead you across himself. He will destroy those nations for you. You will take over their land. Joshua will also lead you across. This is what the Lord has said.
Deuteronomy,31,4,The Lord will do to these nations what he did to Sihon and Og. They were the kings of the Amorites. He destroyed them and their land.
Deuteronomy,31,5,The Lord will give those nations to you. Do to them everything I told you.
Deuteronomy,31,6,Be strong and brave. Don’t be afraid of them. Don’t be frightened. The Lord your God will go with you. He will not leave you or forget you.”
Deuteronomy,31,7,"Then Moses called Joshua and spoke to him in front of the people. Moses said, “Be strong and brave. Lead these people into the land the Lord promised to give their ancestors. Help the people take it as their own."
Deuteronomy,31,8,The Lord himself will go before you. He will be with you. He will not leave you or forget you. Don’t be afraid. Don’t worry.”
Deuteronomy,31,9,So Moses wrote down the teachings. He gave them to the priests and all the elders of Israel. The priests are the sons of Levi. They carried the Ark of the Covenant with the Lord.
Deuteronomy,32,1,"Hear, heavens, and I will speak. Listen, earth, to what I say."
Deuteronomy,32,2,My teaching will drop like rain. My words will fall like dew. They will be like showers on the grass. They will pour down like rain on young plants.
Deuteronomy,32,3,I will announce the name of the Lord. Praise God because he is great!
Deuteronomy,32,4,He is like a rock. What he does is perfect. He is always fair. He is a faithful God who does no wrong. He is right and fair.
Deuteronomy,32,5,They have done evil against him. To their shame they are no longer his children. They are an evil and lying people.
Deuteronomy,32,6,This is not the way to repay the Lord. You are foolish and unwise. He is your Father and Maker. He made you and formed you.
Deuteronomy,32,7,Remember the old days. Think of the years already passed. Ask your father. He will tell you. Ask your elders. They will inform you.
Deuteronomy,32,8,The Most High God gave the nations their lands. He divided up the human race. He set up borders for the people. He even numbered the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,32,9,The Lord took his people as his share. The people of Jacob were his very own.
Deuteronomy,32,10,"He found them in a desert. It was a windy, empty land. He surrounded them and brought them up. He guarded them as those he loved very much."
Deuteronomy,32,11,He was like an eagle building its nest. It flutters over its young. It spreads its wings to catch them. It carries them on its feathers.
Deuteronomy,32,12,The Lord alone led them. There were no foreign gods among them.
Deuteronomy,32,13,The Lord brought them to the heights of the land. He fed them the fruit of the fields. He gave them honey from the rocks. He brought oil from the solid rock.
Deuteronomy,32,14,There were milk curds from the cows and milk from the sheep. There were fat sheep and goats. There were sheep and goats from Bashan. There was the best of the wheat. You drank the juice of grapes.
Deuteronomy,32,15,Israel grew fat and kicked. They were fat and full and firm. They left the God who made them. They rejected the Rock who saved them.
Deuteronomy,32,16,They made God jealous with foreign gods. They made him angry with hated idols.
Deuteronomy,32,17,"They made sacrifices to demons, not God. They were gods they had never known. They were new gods from nearby. Your ancestors did not fear them."
Deuteronomy,32,18,"You left God who is the Rock, your Father. You forgot the God who gave you birth."
Deuteronomy,32,19,The Lord saw this and rejected them. His sons and daughters had made him angry.
Deuteronomy,32,20,"He said, “I will turn away from them. I will see what will happen to them. They are evil people. They are unfaithful children."
Deuteronomy,32,21,They used things that are not gods to make me jealous. They used worthless idols to make me angry. So I will use those who are not a nation to make them jealous. I will use a nation that does not understand to make them angry.
Deuteronomy,32,22,My anger has started a fire. It burns down to where the dead are. It will burn up the ground and its crops. And it will set fire to the mountains.
Deuteronomy,32,23,“I will pile troubles upon them. I will shoot my arrows at them.
Deuteronomy,32,24,"They will be starved and sick. They will be destroyed by terrible diseases. I will send them vicious animals and gliding, poisonous snakes."
Deuteronomy,32,25,In the streets the sword will kill. In their homes there will be terror. Young men and women will die. So will babies and gray-haired men.
Deuteronomy,32,26,I will scatter them as I said. And no one will remember them.
Deuteronomy,32,27,"But I didn’t want their enemy to brag. Their enemy might misunderstand. They might say, ‘We have won! The Lord has done none of this.’”"
Deuteronomy,32,28,Israel has no sense. They do not understand.
Deuteronomy,32,29,I wish they were wise and understood this. I wish they could see what will happen to them.
Deuteronomy,32,30,"One person cannot chase 1,000 people. And 2 people cannot fight 10,000. This only happens if the Lord has sold them. Their Rock would have to give them up."
Deuteronomy,32,31,The rock of these people is not like our Rock. Our enemies agree to that.
Deuteronomy,32,32,Their vine comes from Sodom. Their fields are like Gomorrah. Their grapes are full of poison. Their bunches of grapes are bitter.
Deuteronomy,32,33,"Their wine is like snake poison, like the deadly poison of cobras."
Deuteronomy,32,34,“I have been saving this. I have it locked in my storehouses.
Deuteronomy,32,35,I will punish those who do wrong. I will repay them. Sometime their foot will slip. Their day of trouble is near. And their punishment will come quickly.”
Deuteronomy,32,36,"The Lord will defend his people. He will have mercy on his servants. He will see that their strength is gone. He will see that nobody is left, slaves or free."
Deuteronomy,32,37,"Then he will say, “Where are their gods? Where is the rock they trusted?"
Deuteronomy,32,38,Who ate the fat from their sacrifices? Who drank the wine of their drink offering? Let those gods come to help you! Let them protect you!
Deuteronomy,32,39,"“Now you will see that I am the one God! There is no god but me. I send life and death. I can hurt, and I can heal. No one can escape from me."
Deuteronomy,32,40,"I raise my hand toward heaven and make this promise: As surely as I live forever,"
Deuteronomy,32,41,I will sharpen my flashing sword. And I will take it in my hand to judge. I will punish my enemies. I will pay back those who hate me.
Deuteronomy,32,42,My arrows will be covered with their blood. My sword will eat their flesh. The blood will flow from those who are killed and the captives. The heads of the enemy leaders will be cut off.”
Deuteronomy,32,43,"Be happy, nations, with his people. He will repay you for the blood of his servants. He will punish his enemies. And he will remove the sin of his land and people."
Deuteronomy,32,44,Moses came with Joshua son of Nun. And they spoke all the words of this song for the people to hear.
Deuteronomy,32,45,"When Moses finished speaking these words to all Israel,"
Deuteronomy,32,46,he said to them: “Pay attention to all the words I have said to you today. Command your children to obey carefully everything in these teachings.
Deuteronomy,32,47,These should not be unimportant words for you. They mean life for you! By these words you will live a long time in the land you are crossing the Jordan River to own.”
Deuteronomy,32,48,"The Lord spoke to Moses again that same day. He said,"
Deuteronomy,32,49,“Go up the Abarim Mountains. Go to Mount Nebo in the country of Moab. It is across from Jericho. Look at the land of Canaan. I am giving it to the Israelites to own.
Deuteronomy,32,50,You will die on that mountain that you climb. This is how your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor.
Deuteronomy,32,51,You both sinned against me at the waters of Meribah Kadesh. That is in the Desert of Zin. You did not honor me as holy there among the Israelites.
Deuteronomy,32,52,So now you will only look at the land from far away. You will not enter the land I am giving the people of Israel.”
Deuteronomy,33,1,"Moses, the man of God, gave this blessing to the Israelites before he died."
Deuteronomy,33,2,He said: “The Lord came from Mount Sinai. He rose like the sun from Edom. He showed his greatness from Mount Paran. He came with thousands of angels. He came from the southern mountains.
Deuteronomy,33,3,The Lord surely loves his people. He takes care of all those who belong to him. They bow down at his feet. And they are taught by him.

Deuteronomy,33,14,Let the sun produce the best fruits. Let each month bring its best fruits.
Deuteronomy,33,15,Let the old mountains give the finest crops. And let the everlasting hills give the best fruits.
Deuteronomy,33,16,Let the full earth give the best fruits. Let the Lord who lived in the burning bush be pleased. May these blessings rest on the head of Joseph. May they rest on the forehead of the one who was separated from his brothers.
Deuteronomy,33,17,"Joseph has the majesty of a firstborn bull. He is as strong as a wild ox. He will stab other nations, even those nations far away. These are the ten thousands of Ephraim. And these are the thousands of Manasseh.”"
Deuteronomy,33,18,"Moses said this about the people of Zebulun: “Be happy when you go out, Zebulun. And be happy in your tents, Issachar."

Deuteronomy,33,20,Moses said this about the people of Gad: “Praise God who gives Gad more land! Gad lives there like a lion. He tears off arms and heads.
