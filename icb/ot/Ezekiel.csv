Ezekiel,1,1,"It was the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month of our captivity. I, Ezekiel, was by the Kebar River in Babylon. I was among the people who had been carried away as captives from the land of Judah. The sky opened, and I saw visions of God."
Ezekiel,1,2,It was the fifth year that King Jehoiachin had been a prisoner. It was on the fifth day of the month.
Ezekiel,1,3,The Lord spoke his word to Ezekiel son of Buzi. This was in the land of the Babylonians by the Kebar River. There he felt the power of the Lord.
Ezekiel,1,4,"When I looked, I saw a stormy wind coming from the north. There was a great cloud with a bright light around it. Fire was flashing out of it. And there was something that looked like glowing metal in the center of the fire."
Ezekiel,1,5,Inside the cloud were what looked like four living creatures. They were shaped like men.
Ezekiel,1,6,Each of them had four faces. And each of them had four wings.
Ezekiel,1,7,Their legs were straight. Their feet were like a calf’s hooves. And they sparkled like polished bronze.
Ezekiel,1,8,The living creatures had men’s hands. They were under their wings on their four sides. All four of them had faces and wings.
Ezekiel,1,9,And their wings touched each other. The living creatures did not turn when they moved. Each went straight ahead.
Ezekiel,1,10,Their faces looked like this: In front each living creature had the face of a man. Each one had the face of a lion on the right side. Each one had the face of an ox on the left side. And in back each one had the face of an eagle.
Ezekiel,1,11,This was what their faces looked like. Their wings were spread out above. Each had two wings that touched one of the other living creatures. Each living creature had two wings that covered its body.
Ezekiel,1,12,"Each went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, the living creatures would also go. When they went, they did not turn."
Ezekiel,1,13,"The living creatures looked like burning coals of fire. They were like torches. Fire went back and forth among the living creatures. It was bright, and lightning flashed from it."
Ezekiel,1,14,The living creatures ran back and forth like bolts of lightning.
Ezekiel,1,15,Now I looked at the living creatures. And I saw a wheel on the ground by each of the living creatures with its four faces.
Ezekiel,1,16,The wheels and the way they were made were like this: They looked like sparkling chrysolite. All four of them looked the same. The wheels looked like one wheel crossways inside another wheel.
Ezekiel,1,17,"When they moved, they went in any one of the four directions. They did not turn as they went."
Ezekiel,1,18,I saw the rims of the wheels. The rims were full of eyes all around.
Ezekiel,1,19,"When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them. When the living creatures were lifted up from the ground, the wheels also were lifted up."
Ezekiel,1,20,"Wherever the spirit would go, the living creatures would go. And the wheels were lifted up beside them. This is because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."
Ezekiel,1,21,"When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved. When the living creatures stopped, the wheels stopped. And when the living creatures were lifted from the ground, the wheels were lifted beside them. This is because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."
Ezekiel,1,22,Now there was something like a dome over the heads of the living creatures. It sparkled like ice and was frightening.
Ezekiel,1,23,And under the dome the wings of the living creatures were stretched out straight toward one another. Each living creature also had two wings covering its body.
Ezekiel,1,24,"I heard the sound of their wings as they moved. It was like the roaring sound of the sea. It was like the voice of God All-Powerful. It was a roaring sound like a noisy army. When the living creatures stood still, they lowered their wings."
Ezekiel,1,25,"And a voice came from above the dome over the heads of the living creatures. When the living creatures stood still, they lowered their wings."
Ezekiel,1,26,Now above the dome there was something that looked like a throne. It looked like a sapphire gem. And on the throne was a shape like a man.
Ezekiel,1,27,Then I noticed what he looked like from the waist up. He looked like glowing metal with fire inside it. And from his waist down he looked like fire. I saw a bright light all around him.
Ezekiel,1,28,"The glow around him looked like the rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day. It seemed to look like the glory of the Lord. So when I saw it, I bowed facedown on the ground. And I heard a voice speaking."
Ezekiel,2,1,"He said to me, “Human being, stand up on your feet. Then I will speak with you.”"
Ezekiel,2,2,"While he spoke to me, the Spirit entered me and put me on my feet. Then I heard the Lord speaking to me."
Ezekiel,2,3,"He said, “Human being, I am sending you to the people of Israel. They are a nation of people who turned against me. They broke away from me. They and their ancestors have sinned against me until this very day."
Ezekiel,2,4,"And I am sending you to people who are stubborn. They do not obey. You will say this to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says.’"
Ezekiel,2,5,"The people may listen, or they may not. They are a people who turn against me. But whatever they do, they will know that a prophet has been among them."
Ezekiel,2,6,"You, human being, don’t be afraid of the people or their words. Thorny branches and thorns may be all around you. And you may live with insects that sting with poison. Don’t be afraid of their words. Don’t be afraid of their looks. They are a people who turn against me."
Ezekiel,2,7,"But speak my words to them. They may listen, or they may not, because they turn against me."
Ezekiel,2,8,"But you, human being, listen to what I say to you. Don’t turn against me as those people do. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.”"
Ezekiel,2,9,I looked and saw a hand stretched out to me. A scroll was in the hand.
Ezekiel,2,10,"The Lord opened the scroll in front of me. The scroll was written on the front and back. Funeral songs, sad writings and troubles were written on the scroll."
Ezekiel,3,1,"Then the Lord said to me, “Human being, eat what you find. Eat this scroll. Then go and speak to the people of Israel.”"
Ezekiel,3,2,"So I opened my mouth, and the Lord gave me the scroll."
Ezekiel,3,3,"The Lord said to me, “Human being, eat this scroll which I am giving you. Fill your stomach with it.” Then I ate it. And it was sweet like honey in my mouth."
Ezekiel,3,4,"Then the Lord said to me, “Human being, go to the people of Israel. Speak my words to them."
Ezekiel,3,5,You are not being sent to people whose speech you can’t understand. Their language is not difficult. You are being sent to Israel.
Ezekiel,3,6,"You are not being sent to many nations whose speech you can’t understand. The language of Israel is not difficult. You are not being sent to people whose words you cannot understand. If I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you."
Ezekiel,3,7,"But the people of Israel are not willing to listen to you. This is because they are not willing to listen to me. Yes, all the people of Israel are stubborn and will not obey."
Ezekiel,3,8,"See, I have made you as stubborn as they are. You will be as hard as they are."
Ezekiel,3,9,"I have made you as hard as a diamond, harder than stone. Don’t be afraid of them. Don’t be frightened by them. They are a people who turn against me.”"
Ezekiel,3,10,"Also, the Lord said to me, “Human being, believe all the words that I will speak to you. And listen carefully."
Ezekiel,3,11,"Go to the captives, your people. And speak to them, whether they listen or not. Tell them, ‘The Lord God says this.’”"
Ezekiel,3,12,"Then the Spirit lifted me up. And I heard a loud rumbling sound behind me. A voice said, “Praise God in heaven.”"
Ezekiel,3,13,I heard the wings of the living creatures touching each other. And I heard the sound of the wheels by them. It was a loud rumbling sound.
Ezekiel,3,14,So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away. I was unhappy and angry. I felt the great power of the Lord.
Ezekiel,3,15,I came to the captives from Judah. They lived by the Kebar River at Tel Abib. I sat there seven days where these people lived. I was shocked.
Ezekiel,3,16,"After seven days the Lord spoke his word to me again. He said,"
Ezekiel,3,17,"“Human being, I have made you a watchman for Israel. Any time you hear a word from my mouth, warn them for me."
Ezekiel,3,18,"When I say to an evil person, ‘You will surely die,’ you must warn him. If you don’t speak out to warn the evil person to leave his evil way, he will die in his sin. But I will hold you responsible for his death."
Ezekiel,3,19,"You must warn the evil person. Then if he does not turn from his wickedness or his evil ways, he will die because of his sin. But you will have saved yourself."
Ezekiel,3,20,"“Again, a person who does right may turn away from his goodness. He may do evil. If I caused him to sin, he will die. Because you have not warned him, he will die because of his sin. And the good he did will not be remembered. But I will hold you responsible for his death."
Ezekiel,3,21,"But if you do warn that good person not to sin, he may not sin. Then he will surely live. This is because he was warned. And you will save yourself.”"
Ezekiel,3,22,"Then I felt the power of the Lord there. He said to me, “Get up and go out to the plain. There I will speak to you.”"
Ezekiel,3,23,So I got up and went out to the plain. I saw the glory of the Lord standing there. It was like the glory I saw by the Kebar River. And I bowed facedown on the ground.
Ezekiel,3,24,"Then the Spirit entered me and made me stand on my feet. He spoke to me and said, “Go, shut yourself up in your house."
Ezekiel,3,25,"As for you, human being, the people will tie you up with ropes. They will tie you up, and you will not be able to go out among them."
Ezekiel,3,26,"Also, I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth. Then you will be silent. And you will not be able to argue with the people, even though they turn against me."
Ezekiel,3,27,"But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth. And you will say, ‘The Lord God says this.’ Whoever will listen, let him listen. Whoever refuses, let him refuse. They are a people who turn against me."
Ezekiel,4,1,"“Now, human being, get yourself a brick. Put it in front of you and draw a map of Jerusalem on it."
Ezekiel,4,2,Then surround it with an army. Build battle works against the city. Build a road of earth to the top of the city walls. Set up camps around it. Put heavy logs in place to break down the walls.
Ezekiel,4,3,Then get yourself an iron plate. Put it up like an iron wall between you and the city. Turn your face toward the city as if to attack it. Then surround it and attack it. This is a sign to Israel.
Ezekiel,4,4,“Then lie down on your left side. Take the guilt of Israel on yourself. Their guilt will be on you for the number of days you lie on your left side.
Ezekiel,4,5,I have given you the same number of days as the years of the people’s sin. So you will have the guilt of Israel’s sin on you for 390 days.
Ezekiel,4,6,"“When you have finished these 390 days, lie down a second time. This time lie on your right side. You will then have the guilt of Judah on you. I have given it to you for 40 days. This is a day for each year of their sin."
Ezekiel,4,7,"Then you will turn your face toward the army attacking Jerusalem. With your arm bare, you will prophesy against Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,4,8,I will put ropes on you so you cannot turn from one side to the other. This will last until you have finished the days of your attack on Jerusalem.
Ezekiel,4,9,"“Take wheat, barley, beans, small peas and millet seeds. And put them in one bowl. Make them into bread for yourself. You will eat it the 390 days you lie on your side."
Ezekiel,4,10,You will eat eight ounces of food every day. You will eat it at set times.
Ezekiel,4,11,You will drink about two-thirds of a quart of water every day. Drink it at set times.
Ezekiel,4,12,Eat your food as you would eat a barley cake. Bake it over human dung where the people can see.”
Ezekiel,4,13,"Then the Lord said, “In the same way Israel will eat unclean food. They will eat it among the nations where I force them to go.”"
Ezekiel,4,14,"But I said, “No, Lord God! I have never been made unclean. From the time I was young until now I’ve never eaten anything that died by itself. And I’ve never eaten anything torn by animals. Unclean meat has never entered my mouth.”"
Ezekiel,4,15,"“Very well,” he said. “Then I will give you cow’s dung instead of human dung. You may use it for your fire to bake your bread.”"
Ezekiel,4,16,"Then the Lord said to me, “Human being, look! I am going to cut off the supply of bread to Jerusalem. They will eat the bread that is measured out to them. And they will worry as they eat it. They will drink water that is measured out to them. And they will be in shock as they drink it."
Ezekiel,4,17,This is because bread and water will be hard to find. And the people will be shocked at the sight of each other. They will become weak because of their sin.
Ezekiel,5,1,"“Now, human being, take a sharp sword. Use it like a barber’s razor to shave your head and beard. Then take scales and weigh and divide the hair."
Ezekiel,5,2,Burn one-third with fire when the days of the attack on Jerusalem are over. Burn it in the middle of the city. Then take one-third and cut it up with the knife all around the city. And scatter one-third to the wind. This is how I will chase them with a sword.
Ezekiel,5,3,Also take a few of these hairs and tie them in the folds of your clothes.
Ezekiel,5,4,Take a few more and throw them into the fire and burn them up. From there a fire will spread to all the people of Israel.
Ezekiel,5,5,“This is what the Lord says: This is Jerusalem. I have put her at the center of the nations with countries all around her.
Ezekiel,5,6,But she has refused to obey my laws. She has been more evil than the nations. She has refused to obey my rules even more than those around her. The people of Jerusalem have rejected my laws and have not lived by my rules.
Ezekiel,5,7,“So this is what the Lord God says: You caused more confusion than the nations around you. You did not follow my rules or obey my laws. You have not even obeyed the laws of the nations around you.
Ezekiel,5,8,“So this is what the Lord God says: I myself am against you. I will punish you and the nations will watch.
Ezekiel,5,9,I will do things among you that I have not done before. I will never do anything like them again. I will do them because you do the things I hate.
Ezekiel,5,10,So fathers among you will eat their children. And children will eat their fathers. I will punish you. I will scatter to the winds all who are left alive.
Ezekiel,5,11,"So the Lord God says: As surely as I live, you have made my Temple unclean. You have done it with all your evil idols and the hated things you do. Because of this I will cut you off. I will have no pity. I will show no mercy."
Ezekiel,5,12,A third of you will die by disease or be destroyed by hunger inside your walls. A third will fall dead by the sword outside your walls. And a third I will scatter in every direction. I will chase them with a sword.
Ezekiel,5,13,"Then my anger will come to an end. I will use it up against them. Then I will be satisfied. Then they will know that I, the Lord God, have spoken. After I have carried out my anger against them, they will know how strongly I felt."
Ezekiel,5,14,“I will make you a ruin. And I will make you a shame among the nations around you. All who pass by will see this.
Ezekiel,5,15,"Then you will be shamed by the nations around you. They will make fun of you. You will be a warning to them. They will be terrified. This will happen when I punish you in my great anger. I, the Lord, have spoken."
Ezekiel,5,16,I will send a time of hunger to destroy you. Then I will make your hunger get even worse. I will cut off your supply of food.
Ezekiel,5,17,"I will send a time of hunger and wild animals against you. They will kill your children. Disease and death will sweep through your people. I will bring the sword against you to kill you. I, the Lord, have spoken.”"
Ezekiel,6,1,"Again the Lord spoke his word to me. The Lord said,"
Ezekiel,6,2,"“Human being, look toward the mountains of Israel. Prophesy against them."
Ezekiel,6,3,"Say, ‘Mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the Lord God. The Lord God says this to the mountains, the hills, the ravines and the valleys: I will bring a sword against you. I will destroy your places of idol worship."
Ezekiel,6,4,Your altars will be destroyed. Your incense altars will be broken down. Your people will be killed in front of your idols.
Ezekiel,6,5,I will lay the dead bodies of the Israelites before their idols. And I will scatter your bones around your altars.
Ezekiel,6,6,"In all the places you live, cities will become empty. And the places of idol worship will be ruined. Your altars will become lonely ruins. Your idols will be broken and brought to an end. Your incense altars will be cut down. And the things you made will be wiped out."
Ezekiel,6,7,Your people will be killed and fall among you. Then you will know that I am the Lord God.
Ezekiel,6,8,“‘But I will leave some people alive. Some will not be killed by the nations when you are scattered among the foreign lands.
Ezekiel,6,9,Then those who have escaped will remember me. They will be living among the nations where they have been taken as captives. They will remember how I was hurt because they were unfaithful to me. They had turned away from me. They will remember how I was hurt because they desired to worship their idols. They will hate themselves because of the evil things they did that I hate.
Ezekiel,6,10,Then they will know that I am the Lord. I did not bring this terrible thing on them for no reason.
Ezekiel,6,11,"“‘This is what the Lord God says: Clap your hands, stamp your feet. Say, “Oh!” because the people of Israel have done terrible things. So they will die by war, hunger and disease."
Ezekiel,6,12,The person who is far away will die by disease. The one who is nearby will die in war. The person who is still alive and has escaped these will die from hunger. So I will carry out my anger on them.
Ezekiel,6,13,"Their people will lie dead among their idols around the altars. They will be on every high hill, on all the mountain tops and under every green tree and leafy oak. These are the places where they offered sweet-smelling incense to their idols. Then you will know that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,6,14,"I will use my power against them. I will make the land empty and wasted from the desert to Diblah, wherever they live. Then they will know that I am the Lord.’”"
Ezekiel,7,1,Again the Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,7,2,"“Human being, the Lord says this to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come on the four corners of the land."
Ezekiel,7,3,Now the end has come for you. I will send my anger against you. I will judge you for the way you have lived. I will make you pay for your terrible actions.
Ezekiel,7,4,I will have no pity on you. I will not hold back punishment from you. I will make you pay for your ways and for your terrible actions. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,7,5,“This is what the Lord God says: Disaster on top of disaster is coming.
Ezekiel,7,6,The end has come! The end has come! It has stirred itself up against you! Look! It has come!
Ezekiel,7,7,The end has come for you who live in the land! The time has come. The day of confusion is near. There will be no happy shouting on the mountains.
Ezekiel,7,8,Soon I will pour out my anger against you. I will carry out my anger against you. I will judge you for the way you have lived. I will make you pay for all the things you have done that I hate.
Ezekiel,7,9,I will show no pity. I will not hold back punishment. I will pay you back for the way you have lived and the terrible things you have done. Then you will know that I am the Lord who punishes.
Ezekiel,7,10,"“Look, the day is here. It has come. Destruction has come. Violence has grown. There is more pride than ever."
Ezekiel,7,11,"Violence has grown into a weapon for punishing wickedness. None of the people will be left. None of that crowd, none of their wealth, and nothing of value will be left among them."
Ezekiel,7,12,The time has come. The day has arrived. Don’t let the buyer be happy or the seller be sad. My burning anger is against the whole crowd.
Ezekiel,7,13,"Sellers will not return to the land they have sold as long as they live. This is because the vision against all that crowd will not be changed. Because of their sins, no one will save his life."
Ezekiel,7,14,"They have blown the trumpet, and everything is ready. But no one is going to the battle. My anger is against all that crowd."
Ezekiel,7,15,“The sword is outside. Disease and hunger are inside. The person who is in the field will die by the sword. Hunger and disease will destroy those in the city.
Ezekiel,7,16,Those who are left alive and who escape will be on the mountains. They will moan like doves of the valleys. Each person will groan about his own sin.
Ezekiel,7,17,All hands will hang weakly. All knees will become as weak as water.
Ezekiel,7,18,They will put on rough cloth to show how sad they are. They will tremble all over with fear. Their faces will show their shame. And all their heads will be shaved.
Ezekiel,7,19,The people will throw their silver into the streets. Their gold will be like trash. Their silver and gold will not save them from the Lord’s anger. It will not satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs. It was what caused them to fall into sin.
Ezekiel,7,20,"They were proud of their beautiful jewelry. They used it to make their idols, which I hate, and their evil statues. So I will turn their wealth into something they hate."
Ezekiel,7,21,And I will give it to the foreigners as treasures from war. I will give it to the evil people of the earth as treasure. These foreigners and evil people will dishonor the people’s jewelry.
Ezekiel,7,22,I will also turn away from the people of Israel. They will dishonor my treasured place. Then robbers will enter and dishonor it.
Ezekiel,7,23,“Make chains for captives. The land is full of bloody crimes. And the city is full of violence.
Ezekiel,7,24,So I will bring the worst of the nations to take over the people’s houses. I will also end the pride of the rich. And their holy places will be dishonored.
Ezekiel,7,25,"When the people are suffering greatly, they will look for peace. But there will be none."
Ezekiel,7,26,Disaster will come on top of disaster. Rumor will be added to rumor. Then they will try to get a vision from a prophet. Even the teachings of God from the priest will be lost. And advice from the elders will also be lost.
Ezekiel,7,27,The king will cry greatly. The prince will give up hope. The hands of the people who owned land will shake with fear. I will punish them for the way they have lived. The way they have judged others is the way I will judge them. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”
Ezekiel,8,1,"It was the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month of our captivity. I was sitting in my house with the elders of Judah before me. There I felt the power of the Lord God."
Ezekiel,8,2,I looked and saw something that looked like a man. From his waist down he looked like fire. From his waist up he looked like bright glowing metal.
Ezekiel,8,3,He stretched out the shape of a hand. And he caught me by the hair on my head. The Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the sky. He took me in the visions of God to Jerusalem. He took me to the entrance to the north gate of the inner courtyard of the Temple. The courtyard was where the idol was that caused God to be jealous.
Ezekiel,8,4,The glory of the God of Israel was there. It was like what I had seen on the plain.
Ezekiel,8,5,"Then God said to me, “Human being, now look toward the north.” So I looked up toward the north. I saw an altar to the north of the gate. The idol that caused God to be jealous was in the entrance."
Ezekiel,8,6,"The Lord said to me, “Human being, do you see what they are doing? Do you see how many hated things the people of Israel are doing here? This will drive me far away from my Temple. But you will see things more hated than these.”"
Ezekiel,8,7,"Then the Lord brought me to the entry of the courtyard. When I looked, I saw a hole in the wall."
Ezekiel,8,8,"The Lord said to me, “Human being, dig through the wall.” So I dug through the wall and saw an entrance."
Ezekiel,8,9,"Then the Lord said to me, “Go in and see the terrible, evil things they are doing here.”"
Ezekiel,8,10,So I entered and looked. And I saw pictures of every kind of crawling thing. I saw awful beasts and all the idols of the people of Israel. They were carved on the wall all around.
Ezekiel,8,11,Seventy of the elders of Israel were standing there. They were in front of these carvings and idols. Jaazaniah son of Shaphan stood with them. Each man had his pan for burning incense in his hand. A sweet-smelling cloud of incense was rising.
Ezekiel,8,12,"Then the Lord said to me, “Human being, have you seen what the elders of Israel are doing in the dark? Have you seen each man in the room of his own idol? They say, ‘The Lord doesn’t see us. The Lord has left the land.’”"
Ezekiel,8,13,"And he said to me, “You will see even more terrible things that they are doing.”"
Ezekiel,8,14,Then the Lord brought me to the opening of the north gate of the Temple. And I saw women sitting there crying for Tammuz.
Ezekiel,8,15,"The Lord said to me, “Do you see, human being? You will see things even more terrible than these.”"
Ezekiel,8,16,"Then the Lord brought me into the inner courtyard of the Temple. And I saw about 25 men. They were at the entrance to the Temple, between the porch and the altar. Their backs were turned to the Temple of the Lord. They faced east. They were worshiping the sun in the east."
Ezekiel,8,17,"The Lord said to me, “Do you see, human being? Is it unimportant that the people of Judah are doing the terrible things they have done here? They have filled the land with violence. They continually make me angry. Look, they are insulting me every way they can."
Ezekiel,8,18,"So I will act in anger. I will have no pity. I will not show mercy. Even if they shout in my ears, I won’t listen to them.”"
Ezekiel,9,1,"The Lord shouted with a loud voice in my ears. He said, “You who are chosen to punish this city, come near. Bring your weapon in your hand.”"
Ezekiel,9,2,"Then six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north. Each had his powerful weapon in his hand. Among them was a man dressed in linen. At his side he had things to write with. The men went in and stood by the bronze altar."
Ezekiel,9,3,Then the glory of the God of Israel went up. It had been above the creatures with wings. It moved to the place in the Temple where the door opened. Then the Lord called the man dressed in linen. He had the things to write with at his side.
Ezekiel,9,4,"The Lord said to him, “Go through Jerusalem. Put a mark on the foreheads of the people who groan and cry about all the terrible things being done among them.”"
Ezekiel,9,5,"As I listened, the Lord spoke to the other men. He said, “Go through the city behind the man dressed in linen and kill. Don’t pity anyone. Don’t show mercy."
Ezekiel,9,6,"Kill and destroy old men, young men and women, little children and older women. But don’t touch anyone who has the mark on him. Start at my Temple.” So they started with the elders who were in front of the Temple."
Ezekiel,9,7,"And the Lord said to the men, “Make the Temple unclean. Fill the courtyards with those who have been killed. Go out!” Then the men went out and killed the people in the city."
Ezekiel,9,8,"While the men were killing the people, I was left alone. I bowed facedown on the ground. I cried out, “Oh, Lord God! Will you destroy everyone left alive in Israel when you turn loose your anger on Jerusalem?”"
Ezekiel,9,9,"Then the Lord said to me, “The sin of the people of Israel and Judah is very great. The land is filled with people who murder. And the city is full of people who are not fair. The people say, ‘The Lord has left the land. And the Lord does not see.’"
Ezekiel,9,10,But I will have no pity. I will show no mercy. But I will bring their evil acts back on their heads.”
Ezekiel,9,11,"Then the man dressed in linen reported to the Lord. He was the man who had things to write with at his side. He said, “I have done just as you have commanded me.”"
Ezekiel,10,1,Then I looked and saw the sky above the heads of the living creatures. I saw something like a sapphire gem. It looked like a throne.
Ezekiel,10,2,"The Lord said to the man dressed in linen, “Go in between the wheels under the living creatures. And fill your hands with coals of fire from between the living creatures. Scatter the coals over the city.” As I watched, the man with linen clothes went in."
Ezekiel,10,3,Now the living creatures were standing on the south side of the Temple when the man went in. And the cloud from the Lord filled the inner courtyard.
Ezekiel,10,4,Then the glory of the Lord went up from the living creatures. And it stood over the door of the Temple. The Temple was filled with the cloud. And the courtyard was full of the brightness from the glory of the Lord.
Ezekiel,10,5,The sound of the wings of the living creatures was heard all the way to the outer courtyard. It was like the voice of God All-Powerful when he speaks.
Ezekiel,10,6,"The Lord commanded the man dressed in linen, “Take fire from between the wheels, from between the living creatures.” Then the man went in and stood by a wheel."
Ezekiel,10,7,One living creature put out his hand to the fire that was among them. The living creature took some of the fire. And he put it in the hands of the man dressed in linen. The man took the fire and went out.
Ezekiel,10,8,Something that looked like a man’s hand appeared under the wings of the living creatures.
Ezekiel,10,9,I saw the four wheels by the living creatures. One wheel was by each living creature. The wheels looked like shining chrysolite.
Ezekiel,10,10,All four wheels looked alike. Each looked like a wheel crossways inside another wheel.
Ezekiel,10,11,"When the wheels moved, they went in any of the directions that the four living creatures faced. The wheels did not turn about. The living creatures did not turn their bodies as they went. But they followed wherever their faces pointed."
Ezekiel,10,12,"All their bodies, their backs, hands, wings and the wheels were full of eyes all over. Now each of the four living creatures had a wheel."
Ezekiel,10,13,I heard the wheels being called “whirling wheels.”
Ezekiel,10,14,Each living creature had four faces. The first face was the face of a creature with wings. The second face was the face of a man. The third was the face of a lion. And the fourth was the face of an eagle.
Ezekiel,10,15,The living creatures flew up. They were the same living creatures I had seen by the Kebar River.
Ezekiel,10,16,"And when the living creatures moved, the wheels moved by their sides. The living creatures lifted their wings to fly up from the ground. And the wheels did not leave their sides."
Ezekiel,10,17,"When the living creatures stopped, the wheels stopped. When the creatures went up, the wheels went up also. This was because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."
Ezekiel,10,18,Then the glory of the Lord left the door of the Temple and stood over the living creatures.
Ezekiel,10,19,"The living creatures spread their wings. And they flew up from the ground while I watched. As they went up, the wheels stayed by their sides. They stood where the east gate of the Temple of the Lord opened. The glory of the God of Israel was over them."
Ezekiel,10,20,These are the living creatures I had seen under the God of Israel. This was by the Kebar River. I knew they were called cherubim.
Ezekiel,10,21,Each one had four faces. Each one had four wings. Things that looked like a man’s hands were under their wings.
Ezekiel,10,22,Their faces looked the same as the ones I had seen by the Kebar River. They each went straight ahead.
Ezekiel,11,1,The Spirit lifted me up. And he brought me to the front gate of the Temple of the Lord. This gate faces east. I saw 25 men where the gate opens. I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah. They were leaders of the people. They were among these 25 men.
Ezekiel,11,2,"Then the Lord said to me, “Human being, these are the men who plan evil. And they give wicked advice in this city of Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,11,3,"They say, ‘It is almost time for us to build houses. This city is like a cooking pot. And we are like the best meat.’"
Ezekiel,11,4,"So prophesy against them. Prophesy, human being.”"
Ezekiel,11,5,"Then the Spirit of the Lord entered me. He told me to say: “This is what the Lord says: You have said these things, people of Israel. But I know what is going through your mind."
Ezekiel,11,6,You have killed many people in this city. You have filled its streets with their bodies.
Ezekiel,11,7,“So this is what the Lord God says: Those people you have killed and left in the middle of the city are like the best meat. And this city is like the cooking pot. But I will force you out of the city.
Ezekiel,11,8,"You have feared the sword. But I will bring a sword against you, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,11,9,I will force you out of the city. I will hand you over to strangers. I will surely punish you.
Ezekiel,11,10,You will die by the sword. I will punish you at the border of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,11,11,This city will not be your cooking pot. You will not be the best meat in the middle of the city. I will punish you at the border of Israel.
Ezekiel,11,12,Then you will know that I am the Lord. You did not live by my rules. You did not obey my laws. You did the same things that the nations around you do.”
Ezekiel,11,13,"As I prophesied, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I bowed facedown on the ground. I shouted with a loud voice and said, “Oh no, Lord God! Will you completely destroy the Israelites who are left alive?”"
Ezekiel,11,14,"The Lord spoke his word to me. He said,"
Ezekiel,11,15,"“Human being, the people still in Jerusalem have spoken about your relatives. And they have spoken about all the people of Israel who are captives with you. The people still in Jerusalem have said, ‘They are far from the Lord. This land was given to us as our property.’"
Ezekiel,11,16,"“So say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: I sent the people far away among the nations. I scattered them among the countries. But for a little while I have become a Temple to them in the countries where they have gone.’"
Ezekiel,11,17,“So say: ‘This is what the Lord God says: I will gather you from the nations. And I will bring you together from the countries where you have been scattered. Then I will give you back the land of Israel.’
Ezekiel,11,18,“They will come to this land. Then they will take away all the hated idols from the land. They will take all the terrible images from there.
Ezekiel,11,19,I will give them a desire to respect me completely. I will put a new way to think inside them. I will take out the stubborn heart like stone from their bodies. Then I will give them an obedient heart of flesh.
Ezekiel,11,20,"Then they will live by my rules. They will obey my laws and keep them. They will be my people, and I will be their God."
Ezekiel,11,21,"But some people will want to serve their evil statues and hated idols. And I will pay them back for their evil ways, says the Lord God.”"
Ezekiel,11,22,Then the living creatures lifted their wings. The wheels went beside them. And the glory of the God of Israel was above them.
Ezekiel,11,23,The glory of the Lord went up from inside Jerusalem. And it stopped on the mountain on the east side of the city.
Ezekiel,11,24,The Spirit lifted me up. And he brought me to the captives who had been taken from Judah to Babylonia. He did this in a vision given by the Spirit of God. Then the vision I had seen ended.
Ezekiel,11,25,And I told the things that the Lord had shown me. I told it to the captives from Judah.
Ezekiel,12,1,Again the Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,12,2,"“Human being, you are living among a people who refuse to obey. They have eyes to see, but they do not see. They have ears to hear, but they do not hear. This is because they are a family that refuses to obey."
Ezekiel,12,3,"“So, human being, pack your things as if you will be taken away captive. And walk away like a captive. Do this in the daytime with the people watching. Move from your place to another with the people watching. Maybe they will understand, even though they are a people who refuse to obey."
Ezekiel,12,4,Bring out the things you would pack as a captive. Do it during the day when the people are watching. At evening go out with the people watching. Go like those who are taken away as captives from their country.
Ezekiel,12,5,Dig a hole through the wall while they watch. Bring your things out through the hole.
Ezekiel,12,6,Lift them onto your shoulders with the people watching. Carry them out in the dark. Cover your face so you cannot see the ground. I have made you a sign to the people of Israel.”
Ezekiel,12,7,"I did these things as I was commanded. In the daytime I brought out my things. I was packed, ready to go away as a captive. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands. I brought my things out in the dark. I carried them on my shoulders. And the people saw all this."
Ezekiel,12,8,Then in the morning the Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,12,9,"“Human being, Israel refuses to obey. Didn’t those people ask you, ‘What are you doing?’"
Ezekiel,12,10,"“Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: This message is about the king in Jerusalem. And it is about all the people of Israel who live there.’"
Ezekiel,12,11,"Say, ‘I am a sign to you.’ “The same things I have done will be done to the people in Jerusalem. They will be taken away from their country as captives."
Ezekiel,12,12,The king among them will put his things on his shoulder in the dark. And he will leave. The people will dig a hole through the wall to bring him out. He will cover his face so he cannot see the ground.
Ezekiel,12,13,"But I will spread my net over him. He will be caught in my trap. Then I will bring him to Babylon in the land of the Babylonians. He will not see that land, but he will die there."
Ezekiel,12,14,All who are around the king I will scatter in every direction. I will scatter his helpers and all his army. I will chase them with a sword.
Ezekiel,12,15,“Then they will know that I am the Lord. I will scatter them among the nations. And I will spread them among the countries.
Ezekiel,12,16,But I will save a few of them from the sword. I will save a few from hunger and disease. Then they can tell about their hated actions among the nations where they go. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”
Ezekiel,12,17,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,12,18,"“Human being, shake as you eat your food. Shake with fear as you drink your water."
Ezekiel,12,19,Then say to the people of the land: ‘This is what the Lord God says about the people who live in Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They will eat their food with fear. And they will drink their water in shock. This is because their land will be made empty. This is because of the violence of the people who live in it.
Ezekiel,12,20,And the cities where people live will become ruins. The land will become empty. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’”
Ezekiel,12,21,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,12,22,"“Human being, what is this saying you have in the land of Israel: ‘The days go by and every vision comes to nothing’?"
Ezekiel,12,23,"So say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: I will make them stop saying this. Then nobody in Israel will use it anymore.’ But tell them, ‘The time is near when every vision will come true."
Ezekiel,12,24,There will be no more false visions or pleasing prophecies inside the nation of Israel.
Ezekiel,12,25,"This is because I, the Lord God, will speak. What I say will be done. It will not be delayed. You are a people who refuse to obey. And in your time I will say the word and do it, says the Lord God.’”"
Ezekiel,12,26,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,12,27,"“Human being, look! The people of Israel are saying this: ‘The vision that Ezekiel sees is for a time many years from now. He is prophesying about times far away.’"
Ezekiel,12,28,"“So say to them: ‘The Lord God says this: None of my words will be delayed anymore. What I have said will be done, says the Lord God.’”"
Ezekiel,13,1,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,13,2,"“Human being, prophesy against the prophets of Israel. Say to those who make up their own prophecies: ‘Listen to the word of the Lord."
Ezekiel,13,3,This is what the Lord God says: How terrible it will be for the foolish prophets. They are the ones who follow their own ideas. And they have not seen a vision from me.
Ezekiel,13,4,"People of Israel, your prophets have been like wild dogs hunting to kill and eat among ruins."
Ezekiel,13,5,Israel is like a house in ruins. But you have not gone up into the broken places. Your prophets have not repaired the wall. So how can Israel hold back the enemy in the battle on the Lord’s day of judging?
Ezekiel,13,6,"Your prophets see false visions. They prophesy lies. They say, “This is the message of the Lord.” The Lord has not sent them. But they still hope their words will come true."
Ezekiel,13,7,"You said, “This is the message of the Lord.” But that is a false vision. Your prophecies are lies because I have not spoken."
Ezekiel,13,8,"“‘So this is what the Lord God says: You prophets spoke things that are false. You saw visions that do not come true. That is why I am against you, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,13,9,So I will punish the prophets who see false visions and prophesy lies. They will have no place among my people. Their names will not be written on the list of the people of Israel. They will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord God.
Ezekiel,13,10,"“‘It is because they led my people away. They said, “Peace!” but there is no peace. When the people build a weak wall, the prophets cover it with whitewash to make it look strong."
Ezekiel,13,11,So tell those who cover a weak wall with whitewash that it will fall down. Rain will pour down. Hailstones will fall. And a stormy wind will break the wall down.
Ezekiel,13,12,"When the wall has fallen, people will ask you, “Where is the whitewash you used on the wall?”"
Ezekiel,13,13,“‘So this is what the Lord God says: I will break the wall with a stormy wind. In my anger rain will pour down. And hailstones will destroy the wall.
Ezekiel,13,14,"I will tear down the wall on which you put whitewash. I will level it to the ground. Then people will see the wall’s foundation. And when the wall falls, you will be destroyed under it. Then you will know that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,13,15,"So I will carry out my anger on the wall and against those who covered it with whitewash. Then I will tell you, “The wall is gone. And those who covered it with whitewash are also gone."
Ezekiel,13,16,"The prophets of Israel who prophesy to Jerusalem will be gone. And those who see visions of peace for Jerusalem will be gone also. There will be no peace, says the Lord God.” ’"
Ezekiel,13,17,"“Now, human being, reject the women among your people who make up their own prophecies. Prophesy against them."
Ezekiel,13,18,"Say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: How terrible it will be for women who sew magic charms on their wrists. How terrible it will be for those who make veils of every length. These women do this to trap people. You ruin the lives of my people but try to save your own lives!"
Ezekiel,13,19,And you have dishonored me among my people. You have done it for handfuls of barley and pieces of bread. You have killed people who should not die. And you have kept alive those who should die. You have done this by lying to my people. And my people are willing to listen to lies.
Ezekiel,13,20,“‘So this is what the Lord God says: I am against your magic charms. You use them to trap people as if they were birds. I will tear these charms off your arms. I will free those people you have trapped like birds.
Ezekiel,13,21,I will also tear off your veils. I will save my people from your hands. They will no longer be in your power. You will not trap them. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,13,22,By your lies you caused the heart of the person who did right to be sad. I did not make him sad. You have encouraged the evil person not to stop being evil. And that would have saved his life.
Ezekiel,13,23,So you will not see any more false visions. You will not prophesy anymore. And I will save my people from your power. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’”
Ezekiel,14,1,Some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat down before me.
Ezekiel,14,2,Then the Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,14,3,"“Human being, these men love to worship idols. They put up evil things that cause people to sin. Should I allow them to ask me for help?"
Ezekiel,14,4,"So speak to them. Tell them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Any person in Israel might want to worship idols. He might even put up evil things that cause people to sin. Then he might come to the prophet. When he does, I, the Lord, will answer him. I will put him to death because he worshiped idols."
Ezekiel,14,5,Then I will win back my people Israel. They have left me because of all their idols.’
Ezekiel,14,6,“So say this to the people of Israel: ‘This is what the Lord God says: Change your hearts and lives. Stop worshiping idols. Stop doing all the things I hate.
Ezekiel,14,7,"Any Israelite or any foreigner in Israel can separate himself from me. He can do this by wanting to worship idols. Or he can put up the things that cause people to sin. Then if he comes to the prophet to ask me questions, I, the Lord, will answer him myself."
Ezekiel,14,8,I will reject him. I will make him a sign and an example. I will separate him from my people. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,14,9,"“‘But the prophet may be tricked into giving a prophecy. Then it is because I, the Lord, have tricked that prophet to speak. Then I will use my power against him. I will destroy him from among my people Israel."
Ezekiel,14,10,The prophet will be as guilty as the one who asks him for help. They both will be responsible for their guilt.
Ezekiel,14,11,"Then the nation of Israel will not leave me anymore. And they will not make themselves unclean anymore with all their sins. Then they will be my people. And I will be their God, says the Lord God.’”"
Ezekiel,14,12,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,14,13,"“Human being, sometimes the people of a country will sin against me by not being loyal. When that happens, I will use my power against them. I will cut off their supply of food. I will send them a time of hunger. I will destroy both their people and animals."
Ezekiel,14,14,"Three great men like Noah, Daniel and Job might be in that country. But their goodness could save only themselves, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,14,15,“I might even send wild animals into that land. They would leave the land empty and without children. Then no one would pass through it because of the animals.
Ezekiel,14,16,"As surely as I live, says the Lord God, not even Noah, Daniel and Job could help. Even if they were in the land, they could not save their own sons or daughters. They could only save themselves. And that country would remain empty."
Ezekiel,14,17,"“Or, I might bring a war against that country. I might say, ‘Let a war be fought in that land. Let it destroy its men and animals.’"
Ezekiel,14,18,"As surely as I live, says the Lord God, not even these three men could help. Even if they were in the land, they could not save their sons or daughters. They could only save themselves."
Ezekiel,14,19,"“Or, I might cause a disease to spread in that country. I might pour out my anger against that country, destroying and killing people and animals."
Ezekiel,14,20,"As surely as I live, says the Lord God, not even Noah, Daniel and Job could help. Even if they were in the land, they could not save their son or daughter. They could save only themselves because they did what was right."
Ezekiel,14,21,"“This is what the Lord God says: I will send my four terrible punishments against Jerusalem. They are war, hunger, wild animals and disease. They will destroy people and animals from Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,14,22,But some people will escape. Some sons and daughters will be led out. They will come out to you. You will see how they live. Then you will be comforted after the disasters I have brought against Jerusalem. You will be comforted after all the things I will bring against it.
Ezekiel,14,23,"You will be comforted when you see how they live. You will know there was a good reason for what I did to Jerusalem, says the Lord God.”"
Ezekiel,15,1,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,15,2,"“Human being, what good is the wood of the vine? Is it better than the wood of a tree in the forest?"
Ezekiel,15,3,Can wood be taken from the vine to make anything? Can you use it to make a peg on which to hang something?
Ezekiel,15,4,The vine is thrown into the fire for fuel. The fire burns up both ends and starts to burn the middle. Then is it useful for anything?
Ezekiel,15,5,"When the vine was whole, it couldn’t be made into anything. When the fire has burned it completely, it certainly cannot be made into anything.”"
Ezekiel,15,6,"So this is what the Lord God says: “Out of all the trees in the forest, I gave the wood of the vine as fuel for fire. In the same way I have given up the people who live in Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,15,7,"I will turn against them. They came through one fire. But fire will still destroy them. When I turn against them, you will know that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,15,8,"So I will make the land empty. This is because the people have not been loyal, says the Lord God.”"
Ezekiel,16,1,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,16,2,"“Human being, tell Jerusalem about her hated actions."
Ezekiel,16,3,"Say, ‘This is what the Lord God says to Jerusalem: Your beginnings and your ancestors were in the land of the Canaanites. Your father was an Amorite. And your mother was a Hittite."
Ezekiel,16,4,"On the day you were born, your cord was not cut. You were not washed with water for cleansing. You were not rubbed with salt. You were not wrapped in cloths."
Ezekiel,16,5,"No one felt sorry for you. No one would do any of these things for you. No, you were thrown out into the open field. This is because you were hated on the day you were born."
Ezekiel,16,6,"“‘Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood. I said to you, “Live!”"
Ezekiel,16,7,I made you grow like a plant in the field. You grew up and became tall. You grew up and became like a beautiful jewel. Your breasts formed. Your hair grew. But you were naked and without clothes.
Ezekiel,16,8,"“‘Later I passed by you and looked at you. I saw that you were at the time for love. So I spread my robe over you and covered your nakedness. I also made a marriage promise to you. I entered into an agreement with you. Then you became mine, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,16,9,“‘Then I bathed you with water and washed all the blood off of you. I put oil on you.
Ezekiel,16,10,I put beautiful clothes made with needlework on you. I put sandals of fine leather on your feet. I wrapped you in fine linen and covered you with silk.
Ezekiel,16,11,I put jewelry on you. I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck.
Ezekiel,16,12,I also put a ring in your nose and earrings in your ears. And I put a beautiful crown on your head.
Ezekiel,16,13,"So you wore gold and silver. Your dress was made of fine linen, silk and beautiful needlework. You ate fine flour, honey and olive oil. You were very beautiful and became a queen."
Ezekiel,16,14,"Then you became famous among the nations because you were so beautiful. Your beauty was perfect, because of the glory I gave you, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,16,15,“‘But you trusted in your beauty. You became a prostitute because you were so famous. You had physical relations with anyone who passed by.
Ezekiel,16,16,And you took some of your clothes and made your places of worship colorful. This is where you carried on your prostitution. These things should not have happened. They should never happen again.
Ezekiel,16,17,You also took your beautiful jewelry. It was made from gold and silver I had given you. Then you made for yourselves male idols. And you were a prostitute with them.
Ezekiel,16,18,Then you took your clothes with beautiful needlework and covered the idols. You gave my oil and incense as an offering to them.
Ezekiel,16,19,"Also, you took the bread I gave you. You took the fine flour, oil and honey I gave you to eat. And you offered them before the false gods as a pleasing smell. This is what happened, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,16,20,"“‘Also, you took your sons and daughters who were my children. And you sacrificed them to idols as food. Your sexual sins were not enough for you."
Ezekiel,16,21,You killed my children and offered them up in fire to idols.
Ezekiel,16,22,You did all your hated acts and sexual sins. But you did not remember when you were young. At that time you were naked and had no clothes. You were left in your blood.
Ezekiel,16,23,"“‘How terrible! How terrible it will be for you, says the Lord God. This is what you did after all these evil things."
Ezekiel,16,24,You built yourself a place to worship false gods. You made for yourself a place of worship in every city square.
Ezekiel,16,25,You built a place of worship at the head of every street. You made your beauty hateful. You offered your body for sex to anyone who passed by. Your sexual sins became worse and worse.
Ezekiel,16,26,You also committed shameful acts with the Egyptians. They were your neighbors and partners in sexual sins. Your sexual sins became even worse. And they caused me to be angry.
Ezekiel,16,27,"So then, I used my power against you. I took away some of your land. I let those who hated you defeat you. They were the Philistine women. Even they were ashamed of your evil ways."
Ezekiel,16,28,"Also, you committed shameful acts with the Assyrians because you could not be satisfied. You sinned sexually with them, but you still were not satisfied."
Ezekiel,16,29,You did even more sexual sins in the land of Babylonia. The Babylonians were traders. But you were not satisfied even with this.
Ezekiel,16,30,"“‘Truly your will is weak, says the Lord God. You do all the things a stubborn prostitute does."
Ezekiel,16,31,You built your place to worship false gods at the beginning of every street. And you made places of worship in every city square. But you were not like a prostitute because you refused payment.
Ezekiel,16,32,“‘You are a wife who is guilty of adultery. You desire strangers instead of your husband.
Ezekiel,16,33,"Men pay prostitutes, but you pay all your lovers. You pay them to come to you. And they come from all around and sin sexually."
Ezekiel,16,34,"So you are different from other prostitutes. No one acts like a prostitute the same way you do. You give money, and no money is given to you. Yes, you are different."
Ezekiel,16,35,"“‘So, prostitute, hear the word of the Lord."
Ezekiel,16,36,This is what the Lord God says: You showed your riches to other countries. And you uncovered your body in your sexual sins with your lovers. And you even did it with all your hated idols. You killed your children and offered their blood to your idols.
Ezekiel,16,37,"So I will gather all your lovers with whom you found pleasure. Yes, I will gather all those you loved and those you hated. Yes, I will gather them against you from all around. I will strip you naked in front of them. Then they will be able to see your nakedness."
Ezekiel,16,38,So I will punish you as judges punish women guilty of adultery. I will punish you as murderers are punished. I will put you to death because I am angry and jealous.
Ezekiel,16,39,I will also hand you over to your lovers. They will tear down your places of worship. They will destroy the places where you worship false gods. They will tear off your clothes and take away your jewelry. They will leave you naked and bare.
Ezekiel,16,40,They will bring a crowd against you. They will throw stones at you and cut you into pieces with their swords.
Ezekiel,16,41,They will burn your houses with fire. They will punish you in front of many women. Then I will put an end to your sexual sins. And you will no longer pay your lovers.
Ezekiel,16,42,Then I will rest from my anger against you. I will stop being jealous. I will be quiet and not angry anymore.
Ezekiel,16,43,"“‘You didn’t remember when you were young. So you have made me angry in all these ways. And I will repay you for what you have done, says the Lord God. Didn’t you add sexual sins to all your other acts which I hate?"
Ezekiel,16,44,“‘Everyone who uses wise sayings will say this about you: “The daughter is like her mother.”
Ezekiel,16,45,You are like your mother. She hated her husband and children. You are also like your sisters. They hated their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite. And your father was an Amorite.
Ezekiel,16,46,Now your older sister is Samaria. She lived north of you with her daughters. And your younger sister Sodom lived south of you with her daughters.
Ezekiel,16,47,You followed their ways. And you did what they did. But you were even worse than they were in everything you did.
Ezekiel,16,48,"As surely as I live, says the Lord God, this is true. Your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you and your daughters have done."
Ezekiel,16,49,“‘This was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were proud. They had plenty of food. They lived in great comfort. But she did not help the poor and needy.
Ezekiel,16,50,So Sodom and her daughters were proud. And they did things I hate in front of me. So I got rid of them when I saw what they did.
Ezekiel,16,51,"Also, Samaria did not do half the sins you do. You have done more hated things than they did. So you make your sisters look good because of all the hated things you have done."
Ezekiel,16,52,You will suffer disgrace because you have provided an excuse for your sisters. They are more right than you are. Your sins were even more terrible than theirs. Be ashamed and suffer disgrace because you made your sisters seem right.
Ezekiel,16,53,“‘But I will give Sodom and her daughters their riches back. I will give Samaria and her daughters their riches back. And with them I will also give you back your riches.
Ezekiel,16,54,But you will have to suffer disgrace. You will feel ashamed for all the things you have done. You even gave comfort to your sisters in their sins.
Ezekiel,16,55,Your sisters are Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters. They will return to what they were before. You and your daughters will also return to what you were before.
Ezekiel,16,56,You would not even mention your sister Samaria when you were proud.
Ezekiel,16,57,Nor would you mention her before your evil was uncovered. And now the Edomite women and their neighbors say bad things about you. Even the Philistine women say bad things about you. Those around you hate you.
Ezekiel,16,58,"You will be punished for your sexual sins and actions that I hate, says the Lord."
Ezekiel,16,59,“‘This is what the Lord God says: I will give you what you should have. You hated and broke the marriage agreement.
Ezekiel,16,60,But I will remember my agreement I made with you when you were young. I will make an agreement that will continue forever with you.
Ezekiel,16,61,Then you will remember what you have done. You will be ashamed when you receive your sisters—both your older and your younger sisters. I will give them to you like daughters. But it will not be because of my agreement with you.
Ezekiel,16,62,I will set up my agreement with you. And you will know that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,16,63,"You will remember and be ashamed. You will not open your mouth again because of your shame. This is because I will forgive you for all the things you have done, says the Lord God.’”"
Ezekiel,17,1,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,17,2,"“Human being, give a riddle. Tell a story to the people of Israel."
Ezekiel,17,3,"Say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: A great eagle came to Lebanon. He had great wings with long feathers of many different colors. The eagle took hold of the top of a cedar tree."
Ezekiel,17,4,He pulled off the top branch. And he brought it to a land of traders. The eagle planted it in a city of traders.
Ezekiel,17,5,“‘The eagle took a young plant from the land. And he planted it in a good field near plenty of water. He planted it to grow like a willow tree.
Ezekiel,17,6,"The plant grew and became a low vine that spread over the ground. The vine’s branches turned toward the eagle. The vine’s roots were under the eagle. So the plant became a vine. And its branches grew, sending out leaves."
Ezekiel,17,7,“‘But there was another eagle with great wings and many feathers. The vine then bent its roots toward this eagle. The vine also sent out its branches toward the eagle so he could water it. The vine turned away from the area where it was planted.
Ezekiel,17,8,It was planted in a good field. It was by plenty of water so it could grow branches and give fruit. It could have become a fine vine.’
Ezekiel,17,9,"“Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: The vine will not continue to grow. The first eagle will pull up the vine’s roots and strip off its fruit. Then the vine will dry up. All its new leaves will dry up and die. It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull the vine up by its roots."
Ezekiel,17,10,It might be planted again. But it will not continue to grow. It will completely die when the east wind hits it. It will dry up in the area where it grew.’”
Ezekiel,17,11,Then the Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,17,12,“Say now to the people who refuse to obey: ‘Do you know what these things mean?’ Say: ‘The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem. He took the king and important men of Jerusalem and brought them to Babylon.
Ezekiel,17,13,Then he took a member of the family of the king of Judah. He made an agreement with him. The king of Babylon made this person promise to support him. The king also took away the leaders of Judah.
Ezekiel,17,14,He did this to make the kingdom of Judah weak so it would not be strong again. Then the kingdom of Judah could continue only by keeping its agreement with the king of Babylon.
Ezekiel,17,15,But the king of Judah turned against the king of Babylon. The king of Judah sent his messengers to Egypt. He asked the Egyptians for horses and many soldiers. Will the king of Judah succeed? Will the one who does such things escape? He cannot break the agreement and escape.
Ezekiel,17,16,"“‘As surely as I live, says the Lord God, he will die in Babylon. He will die in the land of the king who made him king of Judah. The king of Judah hated his promise. He broke his agreement with the king of Babylon."
Ezekiel,17,17,The king of Egypt will not help the king of Judah in the war. He will not help with his mighty army and many people. The Babylonians will build devices to attack the cities and to kill many people.
Ezekiel,17,18,"The king of Judah showed that he hated the promise by breaking the agreement. He promised to support Babylon, but he did all these things. So he will not escape."
Ezekiel,17,19,"“‘So this is what the Lord God says: As surely as I live, this is true: I will pay back the king of Judah for hating my promise and breaking my agreement."
Ezekiel,17,20,I will spread my net over him. He will be caught in my trap. Then I will bring him to Babylon. There I will judge him for the unfaithful acts he did against me.
Ezekiel,17,21,"And all the best of his soldiers who escape will die by the sword. Those who live will be scattered to every wind. Then you will know that I, the Lord, have spoken."
Ezekiel,17,22,“‘This is what the Lord God says: I myself will also take a young branch from the top of a cedar tree. And I will plant it. I will cut off a small twig. It will be from the top of the tree’s young branches. I will plant it on a high and great mountain.
Ezekiel,17,23,I will plant it on the high mountain of Israel. Then it will grow branches and give fruit. And it will become a great cedar tree. Birds of every kind will build nests in it. They will live in the shelter of the tree’s branches.
Ezekiel,17,24,"Then all the trees of the field will know that I am the Lord. I am the one who brings down the high tree. I make the low tree tall. I dry up the green tree. And I make the dry tree grow. I am the Lord. I have spoken, and I will do it.’”"
Ezekiel,18,1,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,18,2,“What do you mean by using this saying about the land of Israel: ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes. And that caused the children to grind their teeth from the sour taste’?
Ezekiel,18,3,"“As surely as I live, says the Lord God, this is true: You will not use this saying in Israel anymore."
Ezekiel,18,4,Every living thing belongs to me. The life of the father is mine. And the life of the son is mine. The person who sins will die.
Ezekiel,18,5,“There may be a good person. This person does what is fair and right.
Ezekiel,18,6,He does not eat at the mountain places of worship. He does not look to the idols of Israel for help. He does not commit adultery with his neighbor’s wife. He does not have physical relations with a woman during her time of monthly bleeding.
Ezekiel,18,7,He does not mistreat anyone. But he returns what was given as a promise for a loan. He does not rob other people. He gives bread to hungry people. He gives clothes to those who have no clothes.
Ezekiel,18,8,He does not lend money to get too much interest or profit. He keeps his hand from doing wrong. He judges fairly between men.
Ezekiel,18,9,"He lives by my rules and obeys my laws faithfully. The person who does all these things is good. He will surely live, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,18,10,“But this person might have a wild son who murders people. This son may do any of these other bad things.
Ezekiel,18,11,(But the father himself has not done any of these things.) This son eats at the mountain places of worship. He commits adultery with his neighbor’s wife.
Ezekiel,18,12,He mistreats the poor and needy. He steals things. He refuses to return what was promised for a loan. He looks to idols for help. He does things which I hate.
Ezekiel,18,13,"He lends money for too much interest and profit. Will this son live? No, he will not live! He has done all these hated things. He will surely be put to death. He will be responsible for his own sins."
Ezekiel,18,14,"“But this son might have a son who has seen the sins his father did. But after seeing them, he does not do those things."
Ezekiel,18,15,He does not eat at the mountain places of worship. He does not look to the idols of Israel for help. He does not commit adultery with his neighbor’s wife.
Ezekiel,18,16,He does not mistreat anyone. He does not keep something promised for a loan. He does not steal. But he gives bread to the hungry people. He gives clothes to people without clothes.
Ezekiel,18,17,He keeps his hand from doing wrong. He does not take too much interest or profit when he lends money. He obeys my laws and lives by my rules. He will not die for his father’s sin. He will surely live.
Ezekiel,18,18,But his father took other people’s money unfairly. He robbed his brother. He did what was wrong among his people. So he will die for his own sin.
Ezekiel,18,19,"“But you ask, ‘Why is the son not punished for the father’s sin?’ The son has done what is fair and right. He obeys all my rules. So he will surely live."
Ezekiel,18,20,It is the person who sins that will die. The son will not be punished for the father’s sin. The father will not be punished for the son’s sin. The person who does right is responsible for his own goodness. The evil person is responsible for his own evil.
Ezekiel,18,21,“But the evil person might stop doing all the sins he has done. And he might obey all my rules and do what is fair and right. Then he will surely live. He will not die.
Ezekiel,18,22,His sins will be forgotten. Now he does what is right. So he will live.
Ezekiel,18,23,"I do not really want the evil person to die, says the Lord God. I want him to stop his bad ways and live."
Ezekiel,18,24,“But a person who does right might stop doing good and do wrong. And he might do the same hated things an evil person does. Will he live? All his good acts will be forgotten. This is because he became unfaithful. He has sinned. So he will die because of his sins.
Ezekiel,18,25,"“But you say, ‘What the Lord does isn’t fair.’ Hear now, people of Israel. I am fair. It is what you do that is not fair!"
Ezekiel,18,26,A good person might stop doing good. He might do wrong and die because of it. He will die because he did wrong.
Ezekiel,18,27,An evil person might stop doing the evil things he has done. And he might do what is fair and right. He will save his life.
Ezekiel,18,28,He thought about it and stopped doing all the sins he had done. He will surely live. He will not die.
Ezekiel,18,29,"But the people of Israel still say, ‘What the Lord does isn’t fair.’ People of Israel, I am fair. It is what you do that is not fair."
Ezekiel,18,30,"“So I will judge you, people of Israel. I will judge each person by what he does, says the Lord God. Change your hearts. Stop all your sinning. Then sin will not bring your ruin."
Ezekiel,18,31,"Get rid of all the sins you have done. And get for yourselves a new heart and a new way to think. Why do you want to die, people of Israel?"
Ezekiel,18,32,I do not want anyone to die. So change your hearts and lives so you may live.
Ezekiel,19,1,“Sing a funeral song for the leaders of Israel.
Ezekiel,19,2,Say: ‘Your mother was like a female lion. She lay down among the young lions. She had many cubs.
Ezekiel,19,3,She brought up one of her cubs. And he became a strong lion. He learned to tear the animals he hunted. And he ate people.
Ezekiel,19,4,The nations heard about him. He was trapped in their pit. And they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel,19,5,“‘The mother lion waited and saw that there was no hope for her cub. So she took another one of her cubs and made him a strong lion.
Ezekiel,19,6,This cub roamed among the lions. He was now a strong lion. He learned to tear the animals he hunted. And he ate people.
Ezekiel,19,7,He destroyed their strong places. He destroyed their cities. The land and everything in it were terrified by the sound of his roar.
Ezekiel,19,8,Then the nations came against him from areas all around. And they spread their net over him. He was trapped in their pit.
Ezekiel,19,9,Then they put him into a cage with chains. And they brought him to the king of Babylon. They put him into prison. Then his roar could not be heard again on the mountains of Israel.
Ezekiel,19,10,“‘Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard. It was planted beside the water. The vine had many branches and gave much fruit because there was plenty of water.
Ezekiel,19,11,The vine had strong branches. They were good enough for a king’s scepter. The vine became tall among the thick branches. And it was seen because it was tall with many branches.
Ezekiel,19,12,But it was pulled up by its roots in anger. It was thrown down to the ground. The east wind dried it up. Its fruit was torn off. Its strong branches were broken off. They were burned up.
Ezekiel,19,13,"Now the vine is planted in the desert, in a dry and thirsty land."
Ezekiel,19,14,And fire has spread from the vine’s main branch. It has destroyed its fruit. There is not a strong branch left on it that could become a scepter for a king.’ This is a funeral song. It is to be used as a funeral song.”
Ezekiel,20,1,"It was the seventh year, in the fifth month of our captivity. It was the tenth day of the month. Some of the elders of Israel came to ask about the Lord. They sat down before me."
Ezekiel,20,2,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,20,3,"“Human being, speak to the elders of Israel. Say to them: ‘This is what the Lord God says: Did you come to ask me questions? As surely as I live, I will not let you ask me questions.’"
Ezekiel,20,4,"“Will you judge them? Will you judge them, human being? Let them know the hated things their fathers did."
Ezekiel,20,5,"Say to them: ‘This is what the Lord God says: I chose Israel and made a promise to the descendants of Jacob. At that time I made myself known to them in Egypt. I promised them, “I am the Lord your God.”"
Ezekiel,20,6,At that time I promised them I would bring them out of Egypt. I promised to bring them into a land I had chosen for them. This is a land where much food grows. It is the best of all lands.
Ezekiel,20,7,"I said to them, “Each one of you must throw away the hateful idols you have set your eyes on. Don’t make yourselves unclean with the idols of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.”"
Ezekiel,20,8,“‘But they turned against me and refused to listen to me. They did not throw away the hated idols which they saw and liked. They did not leave the idols of Egypt. Then I decided to pour out my anger against them in the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel,20,9,But I acted to show who I am. I did not allow myself to be dishonored before the nations where the Israelites lived. I made myself known to the Israelites. I did this by bringing them out of Egypt while the nations were watching.
Ezekiel,20,10,So I took them out of Egypt and brought them into the desert.
Ezekiel,20,11,"I gave them my rules. I told them about my laws. If a person obeys them, he will live."
Ezekiel,20,12,I also gave them my Sabbaths. They were to be a sign between us. Then they would know that I am the Lord. I make them holy.
Ezekiel,20,13,"“‘But in the desert Israel turned against me. They did not follow my rules. They rejected my laws. But if a person obeys them, he will live. They dishonored my Sabbaths. Then I decided to pour out my anger against them and destroy them in the desert."
Ezekiel,20,14,"But I acted for the sake of my name. I did not allow it to be dishonored before the nations. As the nations watched, I had brought the Israelites out of Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,15,But in the desert I had to make another promise to the Israelites. I had to promise I would not bring them into the land I had given them. It is a land where much food grows. It is the best of all the lands.
Ezekiel,20,16,This is because they rejected my laws. They did not follow my rules. They dishonored my Sabbaths. They would rather worship their idols.
Ezekiel,20,17,But I had pity on them. I did not destroy them. I did not put an end to them in the desert.
Ezekiel,20,18,"I said to their children in the desert, “Don’t live by the rules of your fathers. Don’t obey their laws. Don’t make yourselves unclean with their idols."
Ezekiel,20,19,I am the Lord your God. Live by my rules. Obey my laws and do them.
Ezekiel,20,20,Keep my Sabbaths holy. They will be a sign between me and you. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.”
Ezekiel,20,21,"“‘But the people turned against me. If a person obeys my laws, he will live. But they did not live by my rules. They were not careful to obey my laws. They dishonored my Sabbaths. So I decided to pour out my anger against them. I decided to carry out my anger against them in the desert."
Ezekiel,20,22,"But I held back my anger. I acted for the sake of my name. Then my name would not be dishonored with the nations watching. As the nations watched, I had brought the Israelites out from Egypt."
Ezekiel,20,23,Also in the desert I had to make a promise to the Israelites. I had to promise to scatter them among the nations and spread them among the countries.
Ezekiel,20,24,This is because they did not obey my laws. They had rejected my rules and dishonored my Sabbaths. And they worshiped the idols of their ancestors.
Ezekiel,20,25,I also allowed them to follow rules that were not good. And they followed laws by which they could not live.
Ezekiel,20,26,I let the Israelites make themselves unclean by the gifts they brought to their false gods. They sacrificed their oldest children in the fire. This is how I shocked them so they would know that I am the Lord.’
Ezekiel,20,27,"“So, human being, speak to the people of Israel. Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Your ancestors spoke against me by being unfaithful to me in this way:"
Ezekiel,20,28,"I had brought them into the land I promised to give them. They saw every high hill and every leafy tree. There they offered their sacrifices to false gods. They brought offerings that made me angry. There, also, they burned their incense. There they poured out their drink offerings."
Ezekiel,20,29,Then I said to them: What is this place where you go to worship false gods?’” (It is still called High Place today.)
Ezekiel,20,30,“So say to the people of Israel: ‘This is what the Lord God says: Will you make yourselves unclean as your ancestors did? Will you be unfaithful and desire their hated idols?
Ezekiel,20,31,"You offer your children as gifts to the false gods. You sacrifice them in the fire. You make yourselves unclean with all your idols even today. So, people of Israel, should I let you ask me questions? As surely as I live, says the Lord God, I will not accept questions from you."
Ezekiel,20,32,"“‘What you want will not come true. You say, “We want to be like the other nations and the people in other lands. We want to worship idols made of wood and stone.”"
Ezekiel,20,33,"As surely as I live, says the Lord God, I will rule you. I will rule you with my great power and strength and anger."
Ezekiel,20,34,I will bring you out from the foreign nations. I will gather you from the lands where you are scattered. I will do this with my great power and strength and anger.
Ezekiel,20,35,I will bring you among the nations as I brought your ancestors into the desert with Moses. There I will judge you face to face.
Ezekiel,20,36,"I will judge you the same way I judged your ancestors. That was in the desert of the land of Egypt. So I will judge you, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,20,37,I will take control of you. I will punish you by my agreement.
Ezekiel,20,38,I will get rid of those who refuse to obey me and who turn against me. I will bring them out of the land where they are now living. But they will never enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,20,39,"“‘This is what the Lord God says: People of Israel, go serve your idols for now. But later you will listen to me. You will not continue to dishonor my holy name with your gifts and false gods."
Ezekiel,20,40,"My holy mountain is the high mountain of Israel. There all Israel will serve me in the land, says the Lord God. There I will accept you. There I will look for your offerings. I will look for the first harvest of your offerings and all your holy gifts."
Ezekiel,20,41,I will accept you like a pleasing smell. This will happen when I bring you out from the foreign nations. It will take place when I gather you from the lands where you are scattered. Then through you I will show how holy I am. The nations will see it.
Ezekiel,20,42,"When I bring you into the land of Israel, you will know that I am the Lord. I will bring you into the land I promised your ancestors."
Ezekiel,20,43,There you will remember everything you did that made you unclean. Then you will hate yourselves for all the evil things you have done.
Ezekiel,20,44,"I will deal with you to show who I am. Then you will know I am the Lord, people of Israel. But it’s not because of your evil ways or unclean actions, says the Lord God.’”"
Ezekiel,20,45,Now the Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,20,46,"“Human being, look toward the south. Prophesy against the south. Prophesy against the forest of the southern area."
Ezekiel,20,47,Say to that forest: ‘Hear the word of the Lord. This is what the Lord God says: I am ready to start a fire in you. The fire will destroy all your green trees and all your dry trees. The flame that burns will not be put out. All the land from south to north will be burned by the fire.
Ezekiel,20,48,"Then all the people will see that I, the Lord, have started the fire. It will not be put out.’”"
Ezekiel,20,49,"Then I said, “Ah, Lord God! The people are saying about me, ‘He is only telling stories.’”"
Ezekiel,21,1,Then the Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,21,2,"“Human being, look toward Jerusalem and speak against their holy place. Prophesy against the land of Israel."
Ezekiel,21,3,Say to Israel: ‘This is what the Lord says: I am against you. I will pull my sword out of its holder. I will separate you from both wicked people and those who do right.
Ezekiel,21,4,I am going to separate the wicked and those who do right. So my sword will come out from its holder. And it will come against all people from south to north.
Ezekiel,21,5,"Then all people will know that I, the Lord, have pulled my sword out from its holder. My sword will not go back in again.’"
Ezekiel,21,6,"“So, human being, groan with breaking heart and great sadness. Make these sad sounds in front of the people."
Ezekiel,21,7,"They will ask you, ‘Why do you make these sad sounds?’ Then you will say, ‘Because of the news that is coming. Every heart will melt with fear. All hands will become weak. Everyone will be afraid. All knees will become weak as water. Look, it is coming. It will happen, says the Lord God.’”"
Ezekiel,21,8,"The Lord spoke his word to me. He said,"
Ezekiel,21,9,"“Human being, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Lord says: A sword, a sword, made sharp and polished."
Ezekiel,21,10,"It is made sharp for the killing. It is polished to flash like lightning. “‘You are not happy about this horrible punishment by the sword. But my son, Judah, you did not change when you were only beaten with a rod."
Ezekiel,21,11,The sword should be polished. The sword is meant to be held in the hand. It is made sharp and polished. It is made ready for the hand of the killer.
Ezekiel,21,12,"Shout and yell, human being. This is because the sword is against my people. It is against all the rulers of Israel. They will be killed by the sword, along with my people. So beat your chest in sadness."
Ezekiel,21,13,"“‘The test will come. And Judah, who is hated by the armies of Babylon, will not last, says the Lord God.’"
Ezekiel,21,14,"“So, human being, prophesy. And clap your hands. Let the sword hit two or three times. It is the sword for killing. It is the sword for much killing. This sword surrounds the people."
Ezekiel,21,15,"Their hearts will melt with fear. And many people will die. I have placed the killing sword at all their gates. Oh! The sword is made to flash like lightning. It is held, ready for killing."
Ezekiel,21,16,"Sword, cut on the right side. Then cut on the left side. Cut anywhere your blade is turned."
Ezekiel,21,17,"I will also clap my hands. Then my anger will rest. I, the Lord, have spoken.”"
Ezekiel,21,18,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,21,19,"“Human being, mark two roads that the king of Babylon and his sword can follow. Both of these roads will start from the same country. And make signs where the road divides and one way goes toward the city."
Ezekiel,21,20,One sign shows the road he can take with his sword to Rabbah. It is in the land of the Ammonites. And the other sign shows the road he can take to Judah and Jerusalem. Jerusalem is protected with strong walls.
Ezekiel,21,21,The king of Babylon will come to where the road divides into two. He will use magic. He will throw lots with arrows. He will ask questions of his family idols. He will look at the liver of a sacrificed animal to learn where he should go.
Ezekiel,21,22,The lots will tell him to go toward his right to Jerusalem. They will tell him these things: Use logs to break down the city gates. Shout the battle cry and give the order to kill. Build a dirt road to the top of the walls and devices to attack the walls.
Ezekiel,21,23,The people of Jerusalem have made agreements with other nations to help them fight Babylon. So they will think this prediction is wrong. But the king of Babylon will remind them of their sin. And he will capture them.
Ezekiel,21,24,“So this is what the Lord God says: ‘You have shown how sinful you are by turning against the Lord. Your sins are seen in all the things you do. So you will be taken captive by the enemy.
Ezekiel,21,25,"“‘You unclean and evil leader of Israel, you will be killed! The time of your final punishment has come."
Ezekiel,21,26,This is what the Lord God says: Take off the turban. Take off the crown. Things will change. Those who are important now will be made unimportant. And those who are unimportant now will be made important.
Ezekiel,21,27,A ruin! A ruin! I will make it a ruin! This place will not be rebuilt until the one comes who has a right to be king. Then I will give it to him.’
Ezekiel,21,28,"“And you, human being, prophesy and say: ‘This is what the Lord God says about the people of Ammon and their insults: A sword, a sword is pulled out of its holder. It is polished to kill and destroy. It will flash like lightning!"
Ezekiel,21,29,Prophets see false visions about you and prophesy lies about you. The sword will be put on the necks of these evil people who are to be killed. Their day has come. The time of your final punishment has come.
Ezekiel,21,30,Put the sword back in its holder. I will judge you in the place where you were created. I will judge you in the land where you were born.
Ezekiel,21,31,I will pour out my anger against you. I will breathe on you with the fire of my anger. I will hand you over to cruel men who are skilled in destruction.
Ezekiel,21,32,"You will be like fuel for the fire. You will die in the land. You will not be remembered. I, the Lord, have spoken.’”"
Ezekiel,22,1,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,22,2,"“And you, human being, will you judge? Will you judge the city of murderers? Then tell her about all her hated acts."
Ezekiel,22,3,You will say: ‘This is what the Lord God says: You are a city that kills those who come to live there. You make yourself unclean by making idols.
Ezekiel,22,4,You have become guilty of murder. And you have become unclean by your idols which you have made. So you have brought your time of punishment near. You have come to the end of your years. So I have made you a thing of shame to the nations. All lands will laugh at you.
Ezekiel,22,5,Those near and those far away will laugh at you. You will have a bad name. You will be full of confusion.
Ezekiel,22,6,"“‘Jerusalem, see how each ruler of Israel in you has been trying to kill people."
Ezekiel,22,7,The people in you hate their fathers and mothers. They mistreat the foreigners in you. They wrong the orphans and widows in you.
Ezekiel,22,8,You hate my holy things. You dishonor my Sabbaths.
Ezekiel,22,9,The men in you tell lies to cause the death of others. The people in you eat food offered to idols at the mountain places of worship. They do sexual sins in you.
Ezekiel,22,10,"The people in you sin sexually with their fathers’ wives. The men in you have physical relations with women who are unclean, during their time of monthly bleeding."
Ezekiel,22,11,One person in you does a hated act with his neighbor’s wife. Another has shamefully violated his daughter-in-law. And another rapes his half sister.
Ezekiel,22,12,"The people in you take money to kill people. You take unfair interest and profits. You make profits by mistreating your neighbor. And you have forgotten me, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,22,13,“‘So with my fists I will hit you who have stolen money and you who have murdered people.
Ezekiel,22,14,"Will you still be brave and strong when I punish you? I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will act."
Ezekiel,22,15,I will scatter you among the nations. I will spread you through the countries. I will get rid of your uncleanness.
Ezekiel,22,16,"But you, yourself, will be dishonored in the sight of the nations. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’”"
Ezekiel,22,17,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,22,18,"“Human being, the people of Israel have become useless like scum to me. They are like the copper, tin, iron and lead left in the furnace. These are left when silver is purified by melting."
Ezekiel,22,19,So this is what the Lord God says: ‘You have become useless like scum. I am going to gather you into Jerusalem.
Ezekiel,22,20,"People gather silver, copper, iron, lead and tin into a furnace. Then they melt it in a blazing fire. In the same way I will gather you in my hot anger. I will put you in Jerusalem and melt you."
Ezekiel,22,21,I will gather you. And I will make you feel the heat of my anger. You will be melted in the fire.
Ezekiel,22,22,"Silver is melted in the furnace. In the same way you will be melted in the city. Then you will know that I, the Lord, have poured out my anger against you.’”"
Ezekiel,22,23,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,22,24,"“Human being, say to the land, ‘You are a land that has not had rain or showers in a day of anger.’"
Ezekiel,22,25,Israel’s rulers make evil plans. They are like a roaring lion that tears the animal it has caught. They have destroyed lives. They have taken treasure and valuable things. They have caused many women to become widows.
Ezekiel,22,26,Israel’s priests do cruel things to my teachings. They do not honor my holy things. They make no difference between holy and unholy things. They teach there is no difference between clean and unclean things. They do not remember my Sabbaths. So I am dishonored by them.
Ezekiel,22,27,Jerusalem’s leaders are like wolves tearing a dead animal. They have killed people for profit.
Ezekiel,22,28,"And the prophets try to cover this up by false visions and by lying. They say, ‘This is what the Lord God says’ when the Lord has not spoken."
Ezekiel,22,29,The people cheat others. They steal. They hurt people who are poor and needy. They cheat foreigners and don’t treat them fairly.
Ezekiel,22,30,“I looked for someone to build up the walls. I looked for someone to stand before me where the walls are broken to defend these people. Then I would not have to destroy them. But I did not find anyone.
Ezekiel,22,31,"So I will let them see my anger. I will destroy them with an anger that is like fire. This is because of all the things they have done, says the Lord God.”"
Ezekiel,23,1,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,23,2,"“Human being, a woman had two daughters."
Ezekiel,23,3,"While they were young, they went to Egypt and became prostitutes. They let men touch and hold their breasts."
Ezekiel,23,4,"The older girl was named Oholah, and her sister was named Oholibah. They were mine and had sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,23,5,"“Samaria left me. She went to her lover, Assyria. The Assyrians were warriors."
Ezekiel,23,6,"They wore blue uniforms. And all of them—governors, commanders and horsemen—were handsome."
Ezekiel,23,7,Samaria became a prostitute for all the important men in Assyria. And she made herself unclean with all the idols of everyone she desired.
Ezekiel,23,8,"She continued the prostitution she began in Egypt. When she was young, she slept with men. They touched her breasts and sinned sexually with her."
Ezekiel,23,9,"“So I gave her to her lovers, the Assyrians, that she wanted so badly."
Ezekiel,23,10,They stripped her naked and took away her sons and daughters. Then they killed her with a sword. Women everywhere began talking about how she had been punished.
Ezekiel,23,11,“Her sister Jerusalem saw what happened to Samaria. And so Jerusalem became worse than her sister in her sexual desire and prostitution.
Ezekiel,23,12,"She also desired the Assyrians. All of them—governors, commanders, warriors dressed in uniform, and horsemen—were handsome."
Ezekiel,23,13,I saw that both girls were alike. Both of them were prostitutes.
Ezekiel,23,14,“But Jerusalem went even further. She saw carvings of Babylonian men on a wall. They wore red
Ezekiel,23,15,and had belts around their waists. They wore turbans on their heads. They all looked like chariot officers born in Babylonia.
Ezekiel,23,16,"When she saw them, she lusted after them. So she sent messengers to them in Babylonia."
Ezekiel,23,17,"So these Babylonian men came and had sinful physical relations with her. They made her unclean. After that, she became sick of them."
Ezekiel,23,18,"But she continued her prostitution so that everyone knew about it. And I finally became sick of her, as I had her sister."
Ezekiel,23,19,But she remembered how she was a young prostitute in Egypt. So she took part in even more prostitution.
Ezekiel,23,20,She wanted men who behaved like animals in their sexual desire.
Ezekiel,23,21,In the same way you desired to do the sinful things you had done in Egypt. There men touched and held your young breasts.
Ezekiel,23,22,"“So, Jerusalem, this is what the Lord God says: You have tired of your lovers. So now I will make them angry with you. And they will surround you."
Ezekiel,23,23,"Men from Babylon and all Babylonia and men from Pekod, Shoa and Koa will come against you. All the Assyrians will come against you. They are governors, commanders, chariot drivers and important men, all riding horses."
Ezekiel,23,24,"Those men will come with great armies. They will come with their weapons, chariots and wagons. They will surround you with large and small shields and with helmets. And I will hand you over to them for punishment. And they will punish you with their own kind of punishment."
Ezekiel,23,25,Then you will see how strong my anger can be. They will punish you in their anger. They will cut off your noses and ears. They will take away your sons and daughters. Those who are left will be burned.
Ezekiel,23,26,They will take off your clothes and steal your jewelry.
Ezekiel,23,27,I will put a stop to the sinful life you began when you were in Egypt. You will not desire these things anymore. And you will not remember Egypt anymore.
Ezekiel,23,28,“This is what the Lord God says: You became sick of your lovers. But I am giving you to those men you now hate.
Ezekiel,23,29,They will treat you with hate and take away everything you worked for. They will leave you empty and naked. Everyone will know about the sinful things you did. Your sexual sins
Ezekiel,23,30,have brought this on you. You have made yourselves unclean by worshiping their idols.
Ezekiel,23,31,You did the same things your sister did. So you will get the same punishment.
Ezekiel,23,32,"“This is what the Lord God says: You will drink the same cup your sister did. And that cup is deep and wide. Everyone will make fun of you, because the cup is full."
Ezekiel,23,33,It will make you miserable and drunk. It is the cup of fear and ruin. It is the cup of your sister Samaria.
Ezekiel,23,34,"You will drink everything in it. Then you will smash it and tear at your breasts. I have spoken, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,23,35,“So this is what the Lord God says: You have forgotten me and turned your back on me. So you will be punished for your sexual sins.”
Ezekiel,23,36,"The Lord said to me: “Human being, will you judge Samaria and Jerusalem? Then show them their hated acts."
Ezekiel,23,37,They are guilty of adultery and murder. They have taken part in adultery with their idols. They even offered their children as sacrifices in the fire. They were to be food for these idols.
Ezekiel,23,38,They have also done this to me: They made my Temple unclean at the same time they dishonored my Sabbaths.
Ezekiel,23,39,They offered their children to their idols. Then they entered my Temple at that very time to dishonor it. That is what they did inside my Temple.
Ezekiel,23,40,"“They even sent for men from far away. A messenger was sent to them, and they came. The two sisters bathed themselves for them, painted their eyes and put on jewelry."
Ezekiel,23,41,They sat on a fine bed with a table set before it. They put my incense and my oil on the table.
Ezekiel,23,42,"“There was the noise of a reckless crowd in the city. Common people gathered, and drunkards were brought from the desert. They put bracelets on the hands of the two sisters. And they put beautiful crowns on their heads."
Ezekiel,23,43,"Then I said about the one who was worn out by her acts of adultery, ‘Let them continue their sexual sins with her. She is nothing but a prostitute.’"
Ezekiel,23,44,"They kept going to her as they would go to a prostitute. So they continued to go to Oholah, which was Samaria, and Oholibah, which was Jerusalem. These were the shameful women."
Ezekiel,23,45,But men who do right will judge them as they judge women who take part in adultery. And they will judge them as they judge women who murder people. This is because Samaria and Jerusalem are guilty of adultery and murder.
Ezekiel,23,46,“This is what the Lord God says: Bring together a mob against Samaria and Jerusalem. And hand them over to be frightened and robbed.
Ezekiel,23,47,Let the mob kill them by throwing stones at them. Let the mob cut them down with their swords. Let them kill their sons and daughters and burn their houses with fire.
Ezekiel,23,48,“So I will put an end to sexual sins in the land. Then all women will be warned. And they will not do the sexual sins you have done.
Ezekiel,23,49,You will be punished for your sexual sins and the sin of worshiping idols. Then you will know that I am the Lord God.”
Ezekiel,24,1,"The Lord spoke his word to me. It was in the ninth year, in the tenth month of our captivity. It was on the tenth day of the month. He said:"
Ezekiel,24,2,"“Human being, write for yourself this date, this very date. The king of Babylon has surrounded Jerusalem this very day."
Ezekiel,24,3,And tell a story to the people who refuse to obey me. Say to them: ‘This is what the Lord God says: Put on the pot. Put it on and pour water in it.
Ezekiel,24,4,Put in the pieces of meat. Put in the best pieces—the legs and the shoulders. Fill it with the best bones.
Ezekiel,24,5,Take the best of the flock. Pile wood under the pot. Boil the pieces of meat until even the bones are cooked.
Ezekiel,24,6,"“‘This is what the Lord God says: How terrible it will be for the city of murderers! How terrible it will be for the rusty pot! Its rust will not go away! Take the meat out of it, piece by piece. Don’t choose any special piece."
Ezekiel,24,7,“‘The blood from her killings is still in the city. She poured the blood on the bare rock. She did not pour it on the ground where dust would cover it.
Ezekiel,24,8,"To stir up my anger and revenge, I put the blood she spilled on the bare rock. So it will not be covered."
Ezekiel,24,9,“‘So this is what the Lord God says: How terrible it will be for the city of murderers! I will also pile the wood high for burning.
Ezekiel,24,10,Pile up the wood and light the fire. Finish cooking the meat. Mix in the spices. And let the bones burn.
Ezekiel,24,11,"Then set the empty pot on the coals. It will become hot, and its copper sides will glow. The dirty scum stuck inside it may then melt and its rust burn away."
Ezekiel,24,12,"But efforts to clean the pot have failed. Its heavy rust cannot be removed, even in the fire."
Ezekiel,24,13,"“‘In your sinful action there is shame. I wanted to cleanse you, but you are still unclean. You will never be cleansed from your sin until my anger against you is carried out."
Ezekiel,24,14,"“‘I, the Lord, have spoken. The time has come for me to act. I will not hold back punishment. I will not feel pity. I will judge you by your ways and actions, says the Lord God.’”"
Ezekiel,24,15,Then the Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,24,16,"“Human being, I am going to take your wife from you. She is the desire of your eyes. She will die suddenly. But you must not be sad or cry loudly for her. You must not shed any tears."
Ezekiel,24,17,"Groan silently. Do not cry loudly for the dead. Tie on your turban, and put your sandals on your feet. Do not cover your face. And do not eat the food people eat when they are sad about a death.”"
Ezekiel,24,18,So I spoke to the people in the morning. Then my wife died in the evening. The next morning I did as I had been commanded.
Ezekiel,24,19,"Then the people asked me, “Tell us, what do the things you are doing mean for us?”"
Ezekiel,24,20,"Then I said to them, “The Lord spoke his word to me. He said,"
Ezekiel,24,21,"‘Say to the people of Israel, This is what the Lord God says: I am going to dishonor my Temple. You think it gives you strength. You are proud of it. You love to look at it. It makes you happy. But your sons and daughters that you left behind in Jerusalem will fall dead by the sword."
Ezekiel,24,22,And you will do as I have done. You will not cover your face. You will not eat the food people eat when they are sad about a death.
Ezekiel,24,23,Your turbans will be on your heads. And your sandals will be on your feet. You will not cry loudly. But you will rot away in your sins. You will groan to each other.
Ezekiel,24,24,"So Ezekiel will be a sign for you. You will do all the same things he did. When it happens, you will know that I am the Lord God.’"
Ezekiel,24,25,"“And as for you, human being, this is how it will be. I will take away the Temple that gives them strength. It makes them happy and proud. They love to look at it. It makes them happy. And I will take away their sons and daughters also."
Ezekiel,24,26,At that time the person who escapes will come to you. He will have information for you to hear.
Ezekiel,24,27,At that time your mouth will be opened. You will speak and be silent no more. So you will be a sign for them. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”
Ezekiel,25,1,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,25,2,"“Human being, look toward the people of Ammon and prophesy against them."
Ezekiel,25,3,"Say to them, ‘Hear the word of the Lord God. This is what the Lord God says: You were glad when my Temple was dishonored. You were glad when the land of Israel was ruined. And you were glad when the people of Judah were taken away as captives."
Ezekiel,25,4,So I am going to give you to the people of the East to be theirs. They will set up their camps among you. They will make their homes among you. They will eat your fruit and drink your milk.
Ezekiel,25,5,And I will make the city of Rabbah a pasture for camels. And the land of Ammon will become a resting place for sheep. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,25,6,This is what the Lord God says: You clapped your hands and stamped your feet. You are happy about all the insults you have made against the land of Israel.
Ezekiel,25,7,So I will use my power against you. I will give you to the nations as if you were valuables taken in war. I will wipe you out of the lands so you will no longer be a nation. I will destroy you. And you will know that I am the Lord.’”
Ezekiel,25,8,"“This is what the Lord God says: ‘Moab and Edom say, “The people of Judah are like all the other nations.”"
Ezekiel,25,9,"So I am going to take away the cities that protect Moab’s borders. They are the best cities in that land. They are Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon and Kiriathaim."
Ezekiel,25,10,"Then I will give Moab, along with the Ammonites, to the people of the East. They will take over these people. Then along with the Ammonites, Moab will not be a nation anymore."
Ezekiel,25,11,So I will punish the people of Moab. And they will know that I am the Lord.’”
Ezekiel,25,12,“This is what the Lord God says: ‘Edom took revenge on the people of Judah. And the Edomites became guilty because of it.
Ezekiel,25,13,So this is what the Lord God says: I will use my power against Edom. I will kill every man and animal in Edom. And I will destroy Edom all the way from Teman to Dedan. The Edomites will die in battle.
Ezekiel,25,14,"I will take revenge on Edom through my people Israel. So the Israelites will do to Edom what my hot anger demands. Then the Edomites will know my revenge, says the Lord God.’”"
Ezekiel,25,15,"“This is what the Lord God says: ‘The Philistines have taken revenge with hateful hearts. Because of their strong hatred, they have tried to destroy Judah."
Ezekiel,25,16,So this is what the Lord God says: I will use my power against the Philistines. I will remove the Kerethites. I will destroy those people still alive on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.
Ezekiel,25,17,I will punish them in my anger until they have had enough. They will know that I am the Lord when I punish them.’”
Ezekiel,26,1,"It was the eleventh year, on the first day of the month of our captivity. The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:"
Ezekiel,26,2,"“Human being, the city of Tyre has spoken against Jerusalem: ‘The city that traded with the nations is destroyed. Now we can be the trading center. The city Jerusalem is ruined. Now we can make money.’"
Ezekiel,26,3,"So this is what the Lord God says: I am against you, Tyre. I will bring many nations against you. They will come like the sea beating its waves on your island shores."
Ezekiel,26,4,They will destroy the walls of Tyre and pull down her towers. I will also scrape away her ruins. I will make Tyre a bare rock.
Ezekiel,26,5,"Tyre will be an island where fishermen dry their nets. I have spoken, says the Lord God. The nations will steal valuable things from Tyre."
Ezekiel,26,6,"Also, her villages on the shore across from the island will be destroyed by war. Then they will know that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,26,7,"“This is what the Lord God says: I will bring a king from the north against Tyre. He is Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the greatest king. He will bring horses, chariots, horsemen and a great army."
Ezekiel,26,8,He will fight a battle and destroy your villages on the shore across from the island. He will set up devices to attack you. He will build a road of earth to the top of the walls. He will raise his shields against you.
Ezekiel,26,9,He will bring logs to pound through your city walls. And he will break down your towers with his iron bars.
Ezekiel,26,10,"His horses will be so many that they will cover you with their dust. Your walls will shake at the noise of horsemen, wagons and chariots. The king of Babylon will enter your city gates. He will enter as men enter a city where the walls are broken through."
Ezekiel,26,11,The hooves of his horses will run over your streets. He will kill your people with the sword. Your strong pillars will fall down to the ground.
Ezekiel,26,12,"Also, his men will take away your riches. They will steal the things you sell. They will break down your walls and destroy your nice houses. They will throw your stones, wood and trash into the sea."
Ezekiel,26,13,So I will stop your songs. The music of your harps will not be heard anymore.
Ezekiel,26,14,"I will make you a bare rock. You will be a place for drying fishing nets. You will not be built again. This is because I, the Lord, have spoken, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,26,15,“This is what the Lord God says to Tyre: The people who live along the seacoast will shake with fear when they hear your defeat. Those of you who are injured and dying will groan.
Ezekiel,26,16,Then all the leaders of the seacoast will go down from their thrones. They will take off their beautiful needlework clothes. They will clothe themselves with fear. They will sit on the ground. They will shake with fear all the time. They will be shocked when they see you.
Ezekiel,26,17,"They will begin singing a funeral song about you. They will say to you: ‘Tyre, you famous city, you have been destroyed! Once seamen lived in you. You and your people had great power on the seas. All the people around you were afraid of you."
Ezekiel,26,18,Now the people who live by the coast will shake with fear on the day you fall. The islands of the sea will be afraid because you have been defeated.’
Ezekiel,26,19,“This is what the Lord God says: I will make you an empty city. You will be like the cities that have no people living in them. I will bring the deep ocean waters over you. The Mediterranean Sea will cover you.
Ezekiel,26,20,At that time I will send you down to the place of the dead. You will join the people who died long ago. I will make you live with the dead below the earth among old ruined places. You will not come back from there. People will never live in you again.
Ezekiel,26,21,"Other people will be afraid of what happened to you. It will be the end of you. People will look for you. But they will never find you again, says the Lord God.”"
Ezekiel,27,1,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,27,2,"“Human being, sing a funeral song for the city of Tyre."
Ezekiel,27,3,"Speak to Tyre that is at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea. For the people of many lands along the seacoast, Tyre is a place for trade. ‘This is what the Lord God says: Tyre, you have said, “I am like a beautiful ship.”"
Ezekiel,27,4,You were at home on the high seas. Your builders have made your beauty perfect.
Ezekiel,27,5,Your builders made all your boards of fir trees from Mount Hermon. They have taken a cedar tree from Lebanon. They took it to make a ship’s mast for you.
Ezekiel,27,6,They made your oars from oak trees in Bashan. They made your deck from cypress trees from the coast of Cyprus. Your deck has ivory set into it.
Ezekiel,27,7,Your sail of linen with designs sewed on it came from Egypt. Your sail became like a flag for you. Your cloth shades over the deck were blue and purple. They came from the island of Cyprus.
Ezekiel,27,8,"Men from Sidon and Arvad used oars to row you. Tyre, your skilled men were the sailors on your deck."
Ezekiel,27,9,Workers of Byblos were on board ship with you. They put caulk in your ship’s seams. All the ships of the sea and their sailors came alongside to trade with you.
Ezekiel,27,10,"“‘Men of Persia, Lydia and Put were soldiers in your army. They hung their shields and helmets on your walls. Their victories made you famous."
Ezekiel,27,11,Men of Arvad and Celicia guarded your city walls all around. Men of Gammad were in your watchtowers. They hung their shields around your walls. They made your beauty perfect.
Ezekiel,27,12,"“‘Tarshish traded with you for many kinds of things. They paid for them with silver, iron, tin and lead."
Ezekiel,27,13,"“‘People of Greece, Tubal and Meshech traded with you. They traded slaves and bronze things for the things you sell."
Ezekiel,27,14,"“‘People of Beth Togarmah traded work horses, war horses and mules for the things you sell."
Ezekiel,27,15,“‘People of Rhodes traded with you. You sold your things on many coastlands. They paid you with ivory tusks and valuable black wood.
Ezekiel,27,16,"“‘Aram traded with you because you had so many good things to sell. They traded turquoise, purple cloth and cloth with designs sewed on. They also traded fine linen, coral and rubies for the things you sell."
Ezekiel,27,17,"“‘Judah and Israel traded with you. They paid for the things you sell with wheat from Minnith. They also paid with honey, olive oil and balm."
Ezekiel,27,18,“‘Damascus traded with you because you have many good things. They paid for them with wine from Helbon and wool from Zahar.
Ezekiel,27,19,"“‘The Greeks from Uzal traded for the things you sold. They paid with wrought iron, cassia and sugar cane for your good things."
Ezekiel,27,20,“‘Dedan traded saddle blankets to you.
Ezekiel,27,21,"“‘Arabia and all the rulers of Kedar traded with you. They traded lambs, male sheep and goats to you."
Ezekiel,27,22,"“‘The traders of Sheba and Raamah traded with you. They paid with all the best spices, valuable gems and gold."
Ezekiel,27,23,"“‘Haran, Canneh, Eden and the traders of Sheba, Asshur and Kilmad traded with you."
Ezekiel,27,24,"They paid with the best clothes, blue cloth and cloth with designs sewed on. They traded carpets of many colors and tightly wound ropes."
Ezekiel,27,25,“‘Trading ships carried the things you sold. You were like a ship full of heavy cargo in the middle of the sea.
Ezekiel,27,26,The men who rowed you brought you out into the high seas. But the east wind has broken you to pieces in the middle of the sea.
Ezekiel,27,27,"Your wealth, your trade and the things you sell will sink. Your seamen, your sailors and your workers will sink. Your traders, your soldiers, and everyone else on board will sink into the sea. This will happen on the day your ship is wrecked."
Ezekiel,27,28,The people on the shore will shake with fear when your sailors cry out.
Ezekiel,27,29,All the men who row will leave their ships. The seamen and the sailors of other ships will stand on the shore.
Ezekiel,27,30,They will cry loudly about you. They will cry very much. They will throw dust on their heads. They will roll in ashes to show they are sad.
Ezekiel,27,31,They will shave their heads for you. And they will put on rough cloth to show they are upset. They will cry very much for you. They will cry loudly.
Ezekiel,27,32,"And in their loud crying they will sing a funeral song for you. “No one was ever destroyed like Tyre, surrounded by the sea.”"
Ezekiel,27,33,"The things you traded went out over the seas. You met the needs of many nations. With your great wealth and things you sold, you made kings of the earth rich."
Ezekiel,27,34,But now you are broken by the sea. You have sunk to the bottom. The things you sell and all your people have gone down with you.
Ezekiel,27,35,All those who live along the shore are shocked by what happened to you. Their kings are terribly afraid. Their faces show their fear.
Ezekiel,27,36,The traders among the nations hiss at you. You have come to a terrible end. And you are gone forever.’”
Ezekiel,28,1,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,28,2,"“Human being, say to the ruler of Tyre: ‘This is what the Lord God says: You are too proud. And you say, “I am a god. I sit on the throne of a god in the middle of the seas.” You think you are as wise as a god. But you are a man, not a god."
Ezekiel,28,3,You think you are wiser than Daniel. You think you can find out all secrets.
Ezekiel,28,4,Through your wisdom and understanding you have made yourself rich. You have gained gold and silver. And you have saved it in your storerooms.
Ezekiel,28,5,"Through your great skill in trading, you have made your riches grow. You are too proud because of your riches."
Ezekiel,28,6,“‘So this is what the Lord God says: You think you are wise like a god.
Ezekiel,28,7,But I will bring foreign people against you. They will be the cruelest nation. They will pull out their swords and destroy all that your wisdom has built. And they will dishonor your greatness.
Ezekiel,28,8,They will kill you. You will die a terrible death like those who are killed at sea.
Ezekiel,28,9,"While they are killing you, you will not be able to say anymore, “I am a god.” You will be only a man, not a god, when your murderers kill you."
Ezekiel,28,10,"You will die like an unclean person. Foreigners will kill you. I have spoken, says the Lord God.’”"
Ezekiel,28,11,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,28,12,"“Human being, sing a funeral song for the king of Tyre. Say to him: ‘This is what the Lord God says: You were an example of what was perfect. You were full of wisdom and perfect in beauty."
Ezekiel,28,13,"You had a wonderful life, like those in Eden, the garden of God. Every valuable gem was on you: ruby, topaz and emerald, yellow quartz, onyx and jasper, sapphire, turquoise and chrysolite. Your jewelry was made of gold. It was prepared on the day you were created."
Ezekiel,28,14,I appointed a living creature to guard you. I put you on the holy mountain of God. You walked among the gems of fire.
Ezekiel,28,15,"Your life was right and good. This was from the day you were created, until evil was found in you."
Ezekiel,28,16,"Because you traded with countries far away, you learned to be cruel, and you sinned. So I threw you down in disgrace from the mountain of God. And the living creature who guarded you forced you out from among the gems of fire."
Ezekiel,28,17,You became too proud because of your beauty. You ruined your wisdom because of your greatness. I threw you down to the ground. Your example taught a lesson to other kings.
Ezekiel,28,18,You dishonored your places of worship through your many sins and dishonest trade. So I set your city on fire. And it burned up. I turned you into ashes on the ground for all those watching to see.
Ezekiel,28,19,All the nations who knew you are shocked about you. Your punishment was so terrible. And you are gone forever.’”
Ezekiel,28,20,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,28,21,"“Human being, look toward the city of Sidon and prophesy against her."
Ezekiel,28,22,"Say: ‘This is what the Lord God says: I am against you, Sidon. I will show my greatness among you. Then people will know that I am the Lord when I have punished Sidon. I will show my holiness by defeating her."
Ezekiel,28,23,"I will send diseases to Sidon, and blood will flow in her streets. Those who are wounded in Sidon will fall dead. She will be attacked from all sides. Then they will know that I am the Lord."
Ezekiel,28,24,“‘No more will neighboring nations be like thorny branches or sharp stickers to hurt Israel. Then they will know that I am the Lord God.
Ezekiel,28,25,“‘This is what the Lord God says: I will gather the people of Israel from the nations where they are scattered. I will show my holiness when the nations see what I do to my people. Then they will live in their own land—the land I gave to my servant Jacob.
Ezekiel,28,26,Then they will live safely in the land. They will build houses and plant vineyards. They will live in safety after I have punished all the nations around who hate them. Then they will know that I am the Lord their God.’”
Ezekiel,29,1,"It was the tenth year, in the tenth month of our captivity. It was on the twelfth day of the month. The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:"
Ezekiel,29,2,"“Human being, look toward the king of Egypt. And prophesy against him and all Egypt."
Ezekiel,29,3,"Say: ‘This is what the Lord God says: I am against you, king of Egypt. You are like a great crocodile that lies in the Nile River. You say, “The Nile is mine. I made it for myself.”"
Ezekiel,29,4,"But I will put hooks in your jaws. I will make the fish of the Nile stick to your sides. I will pull you up out of your rivers, with all the fish sticking to your sides."
Ezekiel,29,5,I will leave you in the desert. I will leave you and all the fish from your rivers. You will fall on the open field. You will not be picked up or buried. I have given you to the wild animals. And I have given you to the birds of the sky for food.
Ezekiel,29,6,Then all the people who live in Egypt will know that I am the Lord. “‘Israel tried to lean on you for help. But you were like a crutch made out of a weak stalk of grass.
Ezekiel,29,7,"When their hands grabbed you, you splintered and tore open their shoulders. When they leaned on you, you broke and made all their backs twist."
Ezekiel,29,8,“‘So this is what the Lord God says: I will cause an enemy to attack you. He will kill your men and animals.
Ezekiel,29,9,"Then Egypt will become an empty desert. They will know that I am the Lord. “‘This is because you said, “The Nile River is mine. And I have made it.”"
Ezekiel,29,10,"So, I am against you. I am against your rivers. I will destroy the land of Egypt. It will be empty desert from Migdol in the north to Aswan in the south. It will be empty all the way to the southern border of Cush."
Ezekiel,29,11,No man or animal will walk through it. No one will live in Egypt for 40 years.
Ezekiel,29,12,I will make the land of Egypt the emptiest country of all. And her cities will be the emptiest of all ruined cities for 40 years. And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations. And I will spread them among the countries.
Ezekiel,29,13,“‘This is what the Lord God says: After 40 years I will gather Egypt from the nations where they have been scattered.
Ezekiel,29,14,I will bring back the Egyptian captives. I will make the Egyptians return to southern Egypt. They will return to the land that they came from. They will become a weak kingdom there.
Ezekiel,29,15,It will be the weakest kingdom. It will never again rule other nations. I will make it so weak it will never again rule over the nations.
Ezekiel,29,16,The Israelites will never again depend on Egypt. Egypt’s punishment will remind the Israelites of their sin. They turned to Egypt for help and not to God. Then they will know that I am the Lord God.’”
Ezekiel,29,17,"It was the twenty-seventh year of our captivity, in the first month. It was on the first day of the month. The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:"
Ezekiel,29,18,"“Human being, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army fight hard against Tyre. Every soldier’s head was rubbed bare. Every shoulder was rubbed raw. But Nebuchadnezzar and his army gained nothing from fighting Tyre."
Ezekiel,29,19,So this is what the Lord God says: I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. And Nebuchadnezzar will take away Egypt’s people. He will take Egypt’s wealth and its valuable things as pay for his army.
Ezekiel,29,20,I have given Nebuchadnezzar the land of Egypt. It is a reward for working hard to defeat Egypt for me. That is what the Lord God says.
Ezekiel,29,21,"“On that day I will make Israel grow strong again. I will let you, Ezekiel, speak to them. Then they will know that I am the Lord God.”"
Ezekiel,30,1,"The Lord spoke his word to me. He said,"
Ezekiel,30,2,"“Human being, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Cry and say, “The terrible day is coming.”"
Ezekiel,30,3,The day is near. The Lord’s day of judging is near. It is a cloudy day. It is a time when the nations will be judged.
Ezekiel,30,4,"An enemy will attack Egypt. And Cush will tremble with fear. When the killing begins in Egypt, her wealth will be taken away. Egypt’s foundations will be torn down."
Ezekiel,30,5,"Cush, Put, Lydia, Arabia, Libya and my people will die. All these who made an agreement with Egypt will fall dead in war."
Ezekiel,30,6,"“‘This is what the Lord God says: Those who fight on Egypt’s side will fall. The power she is proud of will go down. The people in Egypt will fall dead in war from Migdol in the north to Aswan in the south, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,30,7,They will be the emptiest land. Egypt’s cities will be like other cities that lie in ruin.
Ezekiel,30,8,Then they will know that I am the Lord. This will happen when I set fire to Egypt and when all those nations on her side are crushed.
Ezekiel,30,9,“‘At that time I will send messengers in ships. They will frighten Cush which now feels safe. The people of Cush will tremble with fear when Egypt is punished. And that time is sure to come.
Ezekiel,30,10,“‘This is what the Lord God says: I will destroy great numbers of people in Egypt. I will do it through Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
Ezekiel,30,11,Nebuchadnezzar and his army are the cruelest army of any nation. They will be brought in to destroy the land. They will pull out their swords against Egypt. They will fill the land with those they kill.
Ezekiel,30,12,"I will make the streams of the Nile River become dry land. Then I will sell the dry land to evil people. I will destroy the land and everything in it. I will do it through the power of strangers. I, the Lord, have spoken."
Ezekiel,30,13,“‘This is what the Lord God says: I will destroy the idols. And I will take away the statues of false gods from the city of Memphis. There will no longer be a leader in Egypt. And I will spread fear through the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel,30,14,I will make southern Egypt empty. I will start a fire in Zoan. I will punish Thebes.
Ezekiel,30,15,"And I will pour out my anger against Pelusium, the strong place of Egypt. I will destroy great numbers of people in Thebes."
Ezekiel,30,16,I will set fire to Egypt. Pelusium will be in great pain. The walls of Thebes will be broken open. And Memphis will have troubles every day.
Ezekiel,30,17,The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastis will fall dead in war. And the people will be taken away as captives.
Ezekiel,30,18,In Tahpanhes the day will be dark when I break Egypt’s power. A cloud will cover Egypt. And her villages will be captured and taken away.
Ezekiel,30,19,So I will punish Egypt. And they will know I am the Lord.’”
Ezekiel,30,20,"It happened in the eleventh year of our captivity, in the first month. It was on the seventh day of the month. The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:"
Ezekiel,30,21,"“Human being, I have broken the powerful arm of the king of Egypt. It has not been tied up so it will not get well. It has not been wrapped with a bandage. So his arm will not be strong enough to hold a sword in war."
Ezekiel,30,22,So this is what the Lord God says: I am against the king of Egypt. I will break his arms. I will break both the strong arm and the broken arm. I will make the sword fall from his hand.
Ezekiel,30,23,I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations. And I will spread them among the countries.
Ezekiel,30,24,I will make the arms of the king of Babylon strong. I will put my sword in his hand. But I will break the arms of the king of Egypt. Then he will cry out in pain as a wounded man cries out.
Ezekiel,30,25,So I will make the arms of the king of Babylon strong. But the arms of the king of Egypt will fall. Then they will know that I am the Lord. I will put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon. And he will use the sword in war against Egypt.
Ezekiel,30,26,Then I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations. And I will spread them among the countries. And they will know that I am the Lord.”
Ezekiel,31,1,"It happened in the eleventh year of our captivity, in the third month. It was on the first day of the month. The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:"
Ezekiel,31,2,"“Human being, say to the king of Egypt and his people: ‘No one was like you in your greatness."
Ezekiel,31,3,Assyria was once like a cedar tree in Lebanon. It had beautiful branches that shaded the forest. It was very tall. Its top was among the clouds.
Ezekiel,31,4,Much water made the tree grow. The deep springs of water made the tree tall. Rivers flowed around the bottom of the tree. They sent their streams to all other trees of the field.
Ezekiel,31,5,So the tree was taller than all the other trees of the field. Its branches became long and big because of so much water.
Ezekiel,31,6,All the birds of the sky made their nests in the tree’s branches. And all the wild animals gave birth under the tree’s branches. All great nations lived in the tree’s shade.
Ezekiel,31,7,"So the tree was great and beautiful, with its long branches. Its roots reached down to many waters."
Ezekiel,31,8,The cedar trees in the garden of God were not as great as it was. The pine trees did not have such great branches. The plane trees did not have such branches. No tree in the garden of God was as beautiful as this tree.
Ezekiel,31,9,I made it beautiful with many branches. And all the trees of Eden in the garden of God wanted to be like it.
Ezekiel,31,10,“‘So this is what the Lord God says: The tree has grown tall. Its top has reached the clouds. And it has become proud of its height.
Ezekiel,31,11,So I have let a mighty ruler of the nations take care of the tree. The ruler will surely punish the tree. Because it is evil I will get rid of it.
Ezekiel,31,12,The cruelest foreign nation cut it down and left it. The tree’s branches fell on the mountains and in all the valleys. Its broken branches were in all the ravines of the land. All the nations of the earth left the shade of that tree.
Ezekiel,31,13,The birds of the sky live on the fallen tree. The wild animals live among the tree’s fallen branches.
Ezekiel,31,14,Then the trees that grow by the water will not be proud to be tall. They will not put their tops among the clouds. None of the trees that are watered well will grow that tall. They all are meant to die and go under the ground. They will be with those who have died and have gone down to where the dead are.
Ezekiel,31,15,"“‘This is what the Lord God says: On the day when the tree went down to where the dead are, I made people cry loudly. I covered the deep springs and held back their rivers. And the great waters stopped flowing. I made Lebanon cry loudly for the great tree. All the trees of the field dried up and died."
Ezekiel,31,16,I made the nations shake with fear at the sound of the tree falling. I brought the tree down to where the dead are. It went with those who go down to the grave. Then trees of Eden and the best trees of Lebanon were comforted. All the well-watered trees were comforted in the earth below.
Ezekiel,31,17,But these trees also went down with the great tree to the place where the dead are. They went to join those who were killed in war. They had lived under the great tree’s shade. They were its friends among the nations.
Ezekiel,31,18,"“‘So no tree in Eden is equal to you in greatness and honor. But you will go down with the trees of Eden to the earth below. You will lie among unclean people who were killed in war. “‘This will happen to the king of Egypt and all his people, says the Lord God.’”"
Ezekiel,32,1,"It happened in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month of our captivity. It was on the first day of the month. The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:"
Ezekiel,32,2,"“Human being, sing a funeral song about the king of Egypt. Say to him: ‘You are like a young lion among the nations. You are like a crocodile in the seas. You splash around in your streams. And you stir up the waters with your feet. You make the rivers muddy."
Ezekiel,32,3,“‘This is what the Lord God says: I will spread my net over you. And I will use a large group of people to pull you up in my net.
Ezekiel,32,4,Then I will throw you on the land. I will toss you into the open field. I will let the birds of the sky rest on you. And I will let the animals of the earth eat you until they are full.
Ezekiel,32,5,I will scatter your flesh on the mountains. And I will fill the valleys with what is left of you.
Ezekiel,32,6,"I will drench the land with your flowing blood. I will soak the mountains, and the ravines will be full of your flesh."
Ezekiel,32,7,I will make you disappear. And I will cover the sky and make the stars dark. I will cover the sun with a cloud. And the moon will not shine.
Ezekiel,32,8,"I will make all the shining lights in the sky become dark over you. I will bring darkness over your land, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,32,9,I will cause many people to be afraid when I have another nation destroy you. Nations you have not known will be afraid because of you.
Ezekiel,32,10,I will cause people to be shocked about you. Their kings will tremble with fear because of you when I swing my sword before them. They will shake every moment on the day you fall. Each king will be afraid for his own life.
Ezekiel,32,11,“‘So this is what the Lord God says: The sword of the king of Babylon will come on you.
Ezekiel,32,12,I will cause your people to fall by the swords of mighty soldiers. They are the most terrible of all the nations. They will destroy the pride of Egypt. All Egypt’s people will be destroyed.
Ezekiel,32,13,I will also destroy all Egypt’s cattle which live alongside many waters. The foot of man will not stir the waters. And the hooves of cattle will not muddy them anymore.
Ezekiel,32,14,"So I will let the Egyptians’ waters become quiet. I will cause their rivers to run as smoothly as olive oil, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,32,15,I will make the land of Egypt empty. I will take everything that is in the land. I will destroy all those who live in Egypt. Then they will know that I am the Lord.’
Ezekiel,32,16,"“This is the funeral song people will sing for Egypt. The women of the nations will sing it for Egypt. They will sing a funeral song for Egypt and all its people, says the Lord God.”"
Ezekiel,32,17,It happened in the twelfth year of our captivity. It was on the fifteenth day of the month. The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,32,18,"“Human being, cry for the people of Egypt. Bring down Egypt, together with the women of the powerful nations. Bring them down to the earth below. Bring them down with those who go to the place of the dead."
Ezekiel,32,19,Say to them: ‘Are you more beautiful than others? Go lie down in death with those who are unclean.’
Ezekiel,32,20,The Egyptians will fall among those killed by war. Egypt is going to be killed by the sword. The enemy will drag her and all her people away.
Ezekiel,32,21,The leaders of the mighty ones will speak from the place of death. They will say about the king of Egypt and the nations which help him: ‘The king and the nations which help him have come down here. They lie killed by the sword among those who are unclean.’
Ezekiel,32,22,“Assyria and all its army lie dead there. The graves of their soldiers are all around. All were killed in war.
Ezekiel,32,23,"Assyria’s grave was put in the deep parts of the place where the dead are. And its army lies around its grave. When they lived, they frightened people in the land of the living. But now all of them have been killed in war."
Ezekiel,32,24,“The nation of Elam is there. And all its army is around its grave. All of them were killed in war. They had frightened people on earth and were unclean. So they went down to the lowest parts of the place where the dead are. And they must carry their shame with those who go down to the place where the dead are.
Ezekiel,32,25,A bed is made for Elam with all those killed in war. They will be in the place where the dead are. The graves of her soldiers are all around her. Elam’s people are unclean. So they have been killed in war. They also scared people who live on earth. But they must also carry their shame with those who go down to where the dead are. Their graves are with the rest who were killed.
Ezekiel,32,26,“Meshech and Tubal are there. The graves of all their soldiers surround them. All of them are unclean. So they have been killed in war. They also frightened people who live on earth.
Ezekiel,32,27,But they are not buried with the other unclean soldiers who have been killed in battle. They are not with those who went where the dead are with their weapons of war. These soldiers had their swords laid under their heads and their shields on their bodies. People who live on earth used to be afraid of these mighty soldiers.
Ezekiel,32,28,"“You, king of Egypt, will be broken and lie among those who are unclean. You will be with those who were killed in war."
Ezekiel,32,29,“Edom is there also. Its kings and all its leaders are there. They were mighty. But now they lie in death with those killed in war. They will lie with those who are unclean. And they will be with those who go down to where the dead are.
Ezekiel,32,30,"“All the rulers of the north are there. And all the Sidonians are there. Their strength frightened people. These rulers of the north and the Sidonians have gone down in shame with those who were killed. They are unclean, lying with those killed in war. They have carried their shame with those who go down to where the dead are."
Ezekiel,32,31,"“The king of Egypt and his army will see these who have been killed in war. Then the king and all his army will be comforted for all his soldiers killed in war, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,32,32,"I made people who live on earth afraid of the king of Egypt. But he and his people will lie among those who are unclean. They will lie with those who were killed by the sword, says the Lord God.”"
Ezekiel,33,1,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,33,2,"“Human being, speak to your people. Say to them: ‘I might bring a war against a land. The people of the land may choose one of their men. They may make him their watchman."
Ezekiel,33,3,This watchman might see the enemy coming to attack the land. And he blows the trumpet and warns the people.
Ezekiel,33,4,"A person might hear the sound of the trumpet, but do nothing. Then the enemy will come and kill him. That person will be responsible for his own death."
Ezekiel,33,5,"He heard the sound of the trumpet. But he did not do anything. So he is to blame for his own death. If he had done something, he would have saved his own life."
Ezekiel,33,6,But the watchman might see the enemy coming to attack and not blow the trumpet. So the people are not warned. Then the enemy comes and kills one of them. That person has died because of his own sin. But I will punish the watchman for the person’s death.’
Ezekiel,33,7,"“As for you, human being, I have made you a watchman for Israel. If you hear a message from me, you must warn them for me."
Ezekiel,33,8,"I might say to the wicked person: ‘Wicked man, you will surely die.’ But you might not speak to warn the evil person to stop doing evil. Then he will die while still a sinner. But I will punish you for his death."
Ezekiel,33,9,"But you might warn a wicked person to stop doing evil. If he does not stop, he will die while still a sinner. But you have saved your life."
Ezekiel,33,10,"“So you, human being, say to Israel: ‘You have said: Surely our law-breaking and sins are hurting us. They will kill us. What can we do so we will live?’"
Ezekiel,33,11,"Say to them: ‘The Lord God says: As surely as I live, this is true. I do not want a wicked person to die. I want him to stop doing evil and live. Turn back! Turn back from your wicked ways! You don’t want to die, people of Israel.’"
Ezekiel,33,12,"“And you, human being, say to your people: ‘The goodness of a good person will not save him when he sins. The evil of the wicked person will not cause him to be punished if he turns from it. A good person will not be able to live by the good he did earlier if he sins.’"
Ezekiel,33,13,"I might tell the good person, “You will surely live.” But he might think he has done enough good and then do evil. Then none of the good things he did will be remembered. He will die because of the evil he has done."
Ezekiel,33,14,"Or, I might say to the wicked person, “You will surely die.” But he might turn from his sin and do what is right and honest."
Ezekiel,33,15,He returns what somebody gave him as a promise to repay a loan. He pays back what he stole. He lives by the rules that give life. He does not sin. Then that one will surely live. He will not die.
Ezekiel,33,16,He will not be punished for any of his sins. He now does what is right and fair. He will surely live.
Ezekiel,33,17,“But your people say: ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ But it is their own way that is not fair.
Ezekiel,33,18,The good person might turn from his goodness and do evil. Then he will die for his evil.
Ezekiel,33,19,But the wicked person might stop doing evil and do what is right and fair. Then he will live.
Ezekiel,33,20,"You still say: ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ Israel, I will judge each of you by his own ways.”"
Ezekiel,33,21,"It happened in the twelfth year of our captivity. It was on the fifth day of the tenth month. A person who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me. He said, “Jerusalem has been defeated.”"
Ezekiel,33,22,Now I had felt the power of the Lord on me the evening before. The Lord had made me able to talk again. He did this before the person came to me in the morning. I could speak. I was not without speech anymore.
Ezekiel,33,23,Then the Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,33,24,"“Human being, people who live in the ruins in the land of Israel are saying: ‘Abraham was only one person. Yet he was given the land as his own. Surely the land has been given to us, who are many, as our very own.’"
Ezekiel,33,25,So say to them: ‘This is what the Lord God says: You eat meat with the blood still in it. You ask your idols for help. You murder people. Should you then have the land as your very own?
Ezekiel,33,26,You depend on your sword. You do terrible things which I hate. Each of you commits adultery with his neighbor’s wife. So should you have the land?’
Ezekiel,33,27,"“Say to them: ‘This is what the Lord God says: As surely as I live, this is true. Those who are among the city ruins in Israel will be killed in war. Those who live in the country will be eaten by wild animals. People hiding in the strong places and caves will die of disease."
Ezekiel,33,28,I will make the land an empty desert. The people’s pride in the land’s power will end. The mountains of Israel will become empty. No one will pass through them.
Ezekiel,33,29,They will know that I am the Lord when I make the land an empty desert. This is because of the things they have done that I hate.’
Ezekiel,33,30,"“But as for you, human being, your people talk against you. They talk by the walls and in the doorways of houses. They say to each other: ‘Come now, and hear the message from the Lord.’"
Ezekiel,33,31,So they come to you as if they are still my people. They sit before you. They hear your words. But they will not do them. With their mouths they tell me they love me. But their hearts desire their selfish profits.
Ezekiel,33,32,"To your people you are nothing more than a singer who sings love songs. You are like one who has a beautiful voice. You are like one who plays a musical instrument well. They hear your words, but they will not do them."
Ezekiel,33,33,“This will come true. It will surely happen. Then the people will know that a prophet has been among them.”
Ezekiel,34,1,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,34,2,"“Human being, prophesy against the leaders of Israel, who are like shepherds. Prophesy and say to them: ‘This is what the Lord God says: How terrible it will be for the shepherds of Israel who feed only themselves! Why don’t the shepherds feed the flock?"
Ezekiel,34,3,You eat the milk curds from the sheep. You clothe yourselves with the wool from the sheep. You kill the fat sheep. But you do not feed the flock.
Ezekiel,34,4,You have not made the weak strong. You have not healed the sick. You have not put bandages on those that were hurt. You have not brought back those who strayed away. You have not searched for the lost. You ruled the sheep with cruel force.
Ezekiel,34,5,The sheep were scattered because there was no shepherd. Then they became food for every wild animal.
Ezekiel,34,6,My flock wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over all the face of the earth. And no one searched or looked for them.
Ezekiel,34,7,"“‘So, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord. This is what the Lord God says:"
Ezekiel,34,8,"As surely as I live, my flock has been caught. It has become food for all the wild animals. This is because the flock has no shepherd. The shepherds did not search for my flock. No, they fed themselves instead of my flock."
Ezekiel,34,9,"So, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord."
Ezekiel,34,10,This is what the Lord God says: I am against the shepherds. I will blame them for what has happened to my sheep. I will not let them tend the flock anymore. Then the shepherds will stop feeding themselves. And I will take my flock from their mouths. My sheep will no longer be their food.
Ezekiel,34,11,"“‘This is what the Lord God says: I, myself, will search for my sheep. I will take care of them."
Ezekiel,34,12,A shepherd will take care of his scattered flock when it is found. In the same way I will take care of my sheep. I will save them from all the places where they are scattered. I will do this on a cloudy and dark day.
Ezekiel,34,13,I will bring them out from the nations. I will gather them from the countries. I will bring them to their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains and in the ravines of Israel. And I will feed them in all the places where people live in the land.
Ezekiel,34,14,I will feed them in a good pasture. They will eat grass on the high mountains of Israel. They will lie down on good ground where they eat grass. They will eat in rich grassland on the mountains of Israel.
Ezekiel,34,15,"I will feed my flock and lead them to rest, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,34,16,I will search for the lost. I will bring back those that were scattered. I will put bandages on those that were hurt. I will make the weak strong. I will destroy those sheep that are fat and strong. I will tend the sheep with fairness.
Ezekiel,34,17,"“‘This is what the Lord God says: And as for you, my flock, I will judge between one sheep and another. I will judge between the male sheep and the male goats."
Ezekiel,34,18,Is it not enough for you to eat grass in the good land? Must you crush the rest of the grass with your feet? Is it not enough for you to drink clear water? Must you make the rest of the water muddy with your feet?
Ezekiel,34,19,Must my flock eat what you crush? And must they drink what you make muddy with your feet?
Ezekiel,34,20,"“‘So this is what the Lord God says to them: I, myself, will judge between the fat sheep and the thin sheep."
Ezekiel,34,21,You push with your side and with your shoulder. You knock down all the weak sheep with your horns. You do this until you have forced them away.
Ezekiel,34,22,So I will save my flock. They will not be hurt anymore. I will judge between one sheep and another.
Ezekiel,34,23,"Then I will put one shepherd over them, my servant David. He will feed them. He will tend them and will be their shepherd."
Ezekiel,34,24,"Then I, the Lord, will be their God. And my servant David will be a ruler among them. I, the Lord, have spoken."
Ezekiel,34,25,“‘And I will make an agreement of peace with my sheep. I will remove harmful animals from the land. Then the sheep will live safely in the desert. And they will sleep in the woods without danger.
Ezekiel,34,26,I will bless them and let them live around my hill. I will cause the rains to come when it is time for them. There will be showers to bless them.
Ezekiel,34,27,Also the trees of the field will give their fruit. The land will give its harvest. And the sheep will be safe on their land. Then they will know that I am the Lord. I will break the bars of their captivity. And I will save them from the power of those who made them slaves.
Ezekiel,34,28,They will not be led captive by the nations again. The wild animals will not eat them. But they will live safely. No one will make them afraid.
Ezekiel,34,29,I will give them a place famous for its good crops. Then they will no longer suffer from hunger in the land. They will not suffer the insults of other nations anymore.
Ezekiel,34,30,"Then they will know that I, the Lord their God, am with them. The nation of Israel will know that they are my people, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,34,31,"And you, my sheep, are the sheep of my pasture. You are my people and I am your God, says the Lord God.’”"
Ezekiel,35,1,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,35,2,"“Human being, look toward Mount Edom and prophesy against it."
Ezekiel,35,3,"Say to it: ‘This is what the Lord God says: I am against you, Mount Edom. I will stretch out my hand against you. And I will make you an empty desert."
Ezekiel,35,4,I will destroy your cities. And you will become empty. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,35,5,“‘This is because you have always been an enemy of Israel. You let them be defeated in war when they were in trouble. It was the time of their final punishment.
Ezekiel,35,6,"So the Lord God says, As surely as I live, I will let you be murdered. Murder will chase you. You did not hate murdering people, so murder will chase you."
Ezekiel,35,7,And I will make Mount Edom an empty ruin. And I will destroy everyone who goes in or comes out of it.
Ezekiel,35,8,I will fill its mountains with those who are killed. Those killed in war will fall on your hills. They will fall in your valleys and in all your ravines.
Ezekiel,35,9,I will make you a ruin forever. No one will live in your cities. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,35,10,"“‘You said, “These two nations, Israel and Judah, and these two lands will be ours. We will take them for our own.” But the Lord was there."
Ezekiel,35,11,"So this is what the Lord God says: As surely as I live, this is true. I will treat you just as you treated them. When you were angry and jealous, you acted hatefully against them. I will punish you. And that is how I will show the Israelites who I am."
Ezekiel,35,12,"Then you will know that I, the Lord God, have heard all your insults. Those insults were against the mountains of Israel. You said, “They have been ruined. They have been given to us to eat.”"
Ezekiel,35,13,You have not stopped your proud talk against me. I have heard you.
Ezekiel,35,14,This is what the Lord God says: All the earth will be happy when I make you an empty ruin.
Ezekiel,35,15,"You were happy when the land of Israel was ruined. But I will do the same thing to you. Mount Edom and all Edom, you will become an empty ruin. Then you will know that I am the Lord God.’”"
Ezekiel,36,1,"“Human being, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say: ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord."
Ezekiel,36,2,This is what the Lord God says: The enemy has said this against you: “Now the old places to worship false gods have become ours.”’
Ezekiel,36,3,So prophesy and say: ‘This is what the Lord God says: They have made you an empty ruin. They have crushed you from all around. You belonged to the other nations. People talked and whispered against you.
Ezekiel,36,4,"So, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God. The Lord God speaks to the mountains, hills, ravines and valleys. And he speaks to the empty ruins and abandoned cities that have been robbed and laughed at by the other nations."
Ezekiel,36,5,This is what the Lord God says: I have spoken in hot anger against the other nations. I have spoken against Edom. The Edomites took my land for themselves. They did this with joy and with hate in their hearts. They forced out the people and took their pastureland.’
Ezekiel,36,6,"So prophesy about the land of Israel. Say to the mountains, hills, ravines and valleys: ‘This is what the Lord God says: I speak in my jealous anger. This is because you have suffered the insults of the nations."
Ezekiel,36,7,So this is what the Lord God says: I promise that the nations around you will also have to suffer insults.
Ezekiel,36,8,"“‘But you, mountains of Israel, you will grow branches and fruit for my people. My people will soon come home."
Ezekiel,36,9,"I am concerned about you. I am for you. You will be plowed, and seed will be planted in you."
Ezekiel,36,10,I will multiply the people who live on you. All the people of Israel will come. The cities will have people living in them. The ruins will be rebuilt.
Ezekiel,36,11,I will make the people and animals living on you increase in number. They will grow and be fruitful. You will have people living on you as you did before. I will make you better off than at the beginning. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,36,12,"I will cause my people Israel to walk on you. Then they will take you, and you will belong to them. You will never again take their children away from them."
Ezekiel,36,13,“‘This is what the Lord God says: People say about you: “You eat people and take children from your nation.”
Ezekiel,36,14,"You will not destroy people anymore. You will not make your nation stumble anymore, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,36,15,"I will not make you listen to insults from the nations anymore. You will not suffer shame from them anymore, says the Lord God.’”"
Ezekiel,36,16,The Lord spoke his word to me again. He said:
Ezekiel,36,17,"“Human being, the nation of Israel was living in their own land. But they made it unclean by their ways and the things they did. Their ways were like a woman’s uncleanness in her time of monthly bleeding."
Ezekiel,36,18,So I poured out my anger against them. I did it because of the murders they did in the land. And I did it because they made the land unclean with their idols.
Ezekiel,36,19,I scattered them among the nations. And they were spread through all the countries. I punished them for how they lived and the things they did.
Ezekiel,36,20,They dishonored my holy name in the nations where they went. The nations said about them: ‘These are the people of the Lord. But they had to leave the land which he gave them.’
Ezekiel,36,21,But I felt bad about my holy name. The nation of Israel had dishonored it among the nations where they went.
Ezekiel,36,22,"“So say to the people of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Israel, I am going to act, but not for your sake. Israel, I will do something to help my holy name. You have dishonored it among the nations where you went."
Ezekiel,36,23,"I will prove the holiness of my great name. It has been dishonored among the nations. You have dishonored it among these nations. But the nations will know that I am the Lord. I will prove myself holy before their eyes, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,36,24,“‘I will take you from the nations. I will gather you out of all the lands. And I will bring you back into your own land.
Ezekiel,36,25,"Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your uncleanness and your idols."
Ezekiel,36,26,"Also, I will teach you to respect me completely. I will put a new way to think inside you. I will take out the stubborn heart like stone from your bodies. And I will give you an obedient heart of flesh."
Ezekiel,36,27,I will put my Spirit inside you. And I will help you live by my rules. You will be careful to obey my laws.
Ezekiel,36,28,"Then you will live in the land I gave to your ancestors. So you will be my people, and I will be your God."
Ezekiel,36,29,"Also, I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will command the grain to come and grow. I will not allow a time of hunger to hurt you."
Ezekiel,36,30,I will multiply the harvest of the field. You will never again suffer shame among the nations because of hunger.
Ezekiel,36,31,And you will remember your evil ways and the things you did that were not good. Then you will hate yourselves because of your sins and terrible acts that I hate.
Ezekiel,36,32,"I want you to know that I am not doing this for your sake, says the Lord God. Be ashamed and embarrassed about your ways, Israel."
Ezekiel,36,33,“‘This is what the Lord God says: This is what will happen on the day I cleanse you from all your sins: I will cause the cities to have people living in them again. And the destroyed places will be rebuilt.
Ezekiel,36,34,The empty land will be plowed. It will no longer be a ruin for everyone who passes by to see.
Ezekiel,36,35,They will say: “This land was ruined. Now it has become like the garden of Eden. The cities were destroyed. They were empty and ruined. But now they are protected and have people living in them.”
Ezekiel,36,36,"Then those nations still around you will know. They will know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt what was destroyed. And I have planted what was empty. I, the Lord, have spoken. And I will do it.’"
Ezekiel,36,37,“This is what the Lord God says: I will again be asked by the people of Israel to do this thing for them. I will make their people grow to be as many as a flock of sheep.
Ezekiel,36,38,They will be like the flocks brought to Jerusalem during her holy feasts. Her ruined cities will be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”
Ezekiel,37,1,I felt the power of the Lord was on me. He brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord. And he put me down in the middle of a valley. It was full of bones.
Ezekiel,37,2,The Lord led me around among the bones. There were many bones on the bottom of the valley. I saw the bones were very dry.
Ezekiel,37,3,"Then he asked me, “Human being, can these bones live?” I answered, “Lord God, only you know.”"
Ezekiel,37,4,"The Lord said to me, “Prophesy to these bones. Say to them, ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord."
Ezekiel,37,5,This is what the Lord God says to the bones: I will cause breath to enter you. Then you will live.
Ezekiel,37,6,"I will put muscles on you. I will put flesh on you. I will cover you with skin. Then I will put breath in you, and you will live. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’”"
Ezekiel,37,7,"So I prophesied as I was commanded. While I prophesied, there was a noise and a rattling. The bones came together, bone to bone."
Ezekiel,37,8,"I looked and saw muscles come on the bones. Flesh grew, and skin covered the bones. But there was no breath in them."
Ezekiel,37,9,"Then the Lord said to me, “Prophesy to the wind. Prophesy, human being, and say to the wind: ‘This is what the Lord God says: Wind, come from the four winds. Breathe on these people who were killed so they can live again.’”"
Ezekiel,37,10,"So I prophesied as the Lord commanded me. And the breath came into them, and they came to life. They stood on their feet. They were a very large army."
Ezekiel,37,11,"Then the Lord said to me: “Human being, these bones are like all the people of Israel. They say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope has gone. We are destroyed.’"
Ezekiel,37,12,"So, prophesy, and say to them: ‘This is what the Lord God says: My people, I will open your graves. And I will cause you to come up out of your graves. Then I will bring you into the land of Israel."
Ezekiel,37,13,"This is how you, my people, will know that I am the Lord. I will open your graves and cause you to come up from them."
Ezekiel,37,14,"And I will put my Spirit inside you. You will come to life. Then I will put you in your own land. And you will know that I, the Lord, have spoken and done it, says the Lord.’”"
Ezekiel,37,15,"The Lord spoke his word to me. He said,"
Ezekiel,37,16,"“Human being, take a stick of wood. Write on it, ‘For Judah and all the Israelites with him.’ Then take another stick of wood. Write on it, ‘The stick of Ephraim, for Joseph and all the Israelites with him.’"
Ezekiel,37,17,Then join them together into one stick. Then they will be one in your hand.
Ezekiel,37,18,"“Your people will say to you, ‘Explain to us what you mean by this.’"
Ezekiel,37,19,"Tell them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: I will take the stick which is for Joseph and the tribes of Israel with him. This stick is in the hand of Ephraim. Then I will put it with the stick of Judah. And I will make them into one stick. And they will be one in my hand.’"
Ezekiel,37,20,Hold the sticks of wood on which you wrote these names. Hold them in your hands so the people can see them.
Ezekiel,37,21,Say to the people: ‘This is what the Lord God says: I will take the people of Israel from among the nations where they have gone. I will gather them from all around. I will bring them into their own land.
Ezekiel,37,22,"I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. One king will rule all of them. They will never again be two nations. They will not be divided into two kingdoms anymore."
Ezekiel,37,23,"They will not continue to make themselves unclean by their idols, their statues of gods which I hate or their sins. But I will save them from all the ways they sin and turn against me. And I will make them clean. Then they will be my people. And I will be their God."
Ezekiel,37,24,“‘And my servant David will be their king. They will all have one shepherd. They will live by my rules and obey my laws.
Ezekiel,37,25,"They will live on the land I gave to my servant Jacob. It is the land in which your ancestors lived. They will all live on the land forever: they, their children and their grandchildren. David my servant will be their king forever."
Ezekiel,37,26,And I will make an agreement of peace with them. It will be an agreement that continues forever. I will put them in their land. I will make them grow in number. Then I will put my Temple among them forever.
Ezekiel,37,27,"The place where I live will be with them. I will be their God, and they will be my people."
Ezekiel,37,28,"When my Temple is among them forever, the nations will know that I, the Lord, make Israel holy.’”"
Ezekiel,38,1,The Lord spoke his word to me. He said:
Ezekiel,38,2,"“Human being, turn toward Gog of the land of Magog. He is the chief ruler of the nations of Meshech and Tubal. Prophesy against him."
Ezekiel,38,3,"Say, ‘The Lord God says this: I am against you, Gog, chief ruler of Meshech and Tubal."
Ezekiel,38,4,"I will turn you around. I will put hooks in your jaws. And I will bring you out with all your army, horses and horsemen. All of them will be finely dressed. They will be a large army with large and small shields. All of them will have swords."
Ezekiel,38,5,"Persia, Cush and Put will be with them. All of them will have shields and helmets."
Ezekiel,38,6,There will also be Gomer with all its troops. And there will be the nation of Togarmah from the far north. It will have all its troops. There will be many other nations with you.
Ezekiel,38,7,"“‘Be prepared. Be prepared, you and all the armies that have come together to make you their commander."
Ezekiel,38,8,After many days you will be called for service. After many years you will come into a land that has been rebuilt from war. The people in the land will be gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel. Those mountains were empty for a long time. These people were brought out from the nations. They will all be living in safety.
Ezekiel,38,9,"And you will go up like a storm. You will be like a cloud covering the land. It will be you, all your troops and many nations with you."
Ezekiel,38,10,“‘This is what the Lord God says: At that time ideas will come into your mind. You will think up an evil plan.
Ezekiel,38,11,"You will say, “I will march against a land of towns without walls. I will attack those who are at rest and live in safety. All of them live without city walls. They have no gate bars or gates."
Ezekiel,38,12,I will capture valuable things and take good things. I will turn my power against the rebuilt ruins that now have people living in them. I will go against these people who have been gathered from the nations. They have become rich with farm animals and property. They live at the center of the world.”
Ezekiel,38,13,"Sheba, Dedan and the traders of Tarshish, with all its villages, will say this to you: “Did you come to capture valuable things? Did you bring your troops together to take things? Did you bring them to carry away silver and gold? Did you bring them to take away farm animals and property?”’"
Ezekiel,38,14,"“So prophesy, human being, and say to Gog: ‘This is what the Lord God says: Now that my people Israel are living in safety, you will know about it."
Ezekiel,38,15,You will come from your place in the far north. And many people will be with you. All of them will ride on horses. You will be a large group with a mighty army.
Ezekiel,38,16,"You will come against my people Israel like a cloud that covers the land. This will happen in the days to come. I will bring you against my land. Gog, then the nations will know me. They will see me show my greatness by what I do through you."
Ezekiel,38,17,“‘This is what the Lord God says: You are the one about whom I spoke in past days. I spoke through my servants the prophets of Israel. These prophets of Israel prophesied for many years. They said that I would bring you against them.
Ezekiel,38,18,"This is what will happen: On the day Gog comes against the land of Israel, my anger will become very great, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,38,19,With jealousy and great anger I tell you this. At that time there will surely be a great earthquake in Israel.
Ezekiel,38,20,The fish of the sea and the birds of the sky will shake with fear before me. The wild animals and everything that crawls on the ground will shake with fear. And all the people on the earth will shake with fear before me. Also the mountains will be thrown down. And the cliffs will fall. Every wall will fall to the ground.
Ezekiel,38,21,"And I will call for a war against Gog on all my mountains, says the Lord God. Every man’s sword will be against his brother."
Ezekiel,38,22,"I will punish Gog with disease and death. I will send a heavy rain, with hailstones and burning sulfur on Gog. I will send it on his army and on the many nations with him."
Ezekiel,38,23,Then I will show how great I am. I will show my holiness. And I will make myself known to the many nations that watch. Then they will know that I am the Lord.’
Ezekiel,39,1,"“Human being, prophesy against Gog and say: ‘This is what the Lord God says: I am against you, Gog, chief ruler of Meshech and Tubal."
Ezekiel,39,2,I will turn you around and lead you. I will bring you from the far north. I will send you to attack the mountains of Israel.
Ezekiel,39,3,I will knock your bow out of your left hand. I will throw down your arrows from your right hand.
Ezekiel,39,4,"You will fall dead on the mountains of Israel. You, all your troops and the nations with you will fall dead. I will let you be food for every bird that eats meat and every wild animal."
Ezekiel,39,5,"You will die in the country. I have spoken, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,39,6,I will send fire on Magog and those who live in safety on the coastlands. Then they will know that I am the Lord.
Ezekiel,39,7,“‘And I will make myself known among my people Israel. I will not let myself be dishonored anymore. Then the nations will know that I am the Lord. They will know I am the Holy One in Israel.
Ezekiel,39,8,"It is coming! It will happen, says the Lord God. The day I talked about is coming."
Ezekiel,39,9,"“‘Then those who live in the cities of Israel will go out. They will make fires with the enemy’s weapons and burn them. They will burn both large and small shields. They will burn bows and arrows, war clubs and spears. They will use the weapons to burn in their fires for seven years."
Ezekiel,39,10,"They won’t need to take wood from the field or chop firewood from the forests. This is because they will make fires with the weapons. They will take the valuable things of those who took their valuable things. They will grab the things of those who grabbed their things, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,39,11,"“‘On that day I will give Gog a place to be buried in Israel. It will be the Valley of the Travelers, east of the Dead Sea. It will block the road for travelers. This is because Gog and all his army will be buried there. People will call it The Valley of Gog’s Army."
Ezekiel,39,12,“‘The people of Israel will be burying them for seven months to make the land clean again.
Ezekiel,39,13,"All the people of the land will bury them. The people of Israel will be honored on the day of my victory, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,39,14,"“‘They will choose men to work through the land to make it clean. With others they will bury Gog’s soldiers still lying dead on the ground. After the seven months are finished, they will still search."
Ezekiel,39,15,"They will go through the land. If one person sees a human bone, he will put a marker by it. The sign will stay there until the gravediggers come. They will bury the bone in The Valley of Gog’s Army."
Ezekiel,39,16,A city will be there named Hamonah. So they will make the land clean again.’
Ezekiel,39,17,"“Human being, this is what the Lord God says: Speak to every kind of bird and wild animal: ‘Come together, come! Come together from all around to my sacrifice. I will prepare it for you. It is a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel. Then you can eat flesh and drink blood."
Ezekiel,39,18,"You will eat the flesh of mighty men. You will drink the blood of the rulers of the earth. You will do it as people eat all the fat animals from Bashan: male sheep, lambs, goats and bulls."
Ezekiel,39,19,You will eat and drink from my sacrifice which I have made ready for you. So you will eat fat until you are full. You will drink blood until you are drunk.
Ezekiel,39,20,"At my table you will eat until you are full of horses and riders and all kinds of soldiers,’ says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,39,21,“And I will show my greatness among the nations. All the nations will feel my power when I punish them.
Ezekiel,39,22,From that day on the people of Israel will know that I am the Lord their God.
Ezekiel,39,23,And the nations will know Israel was taken away captive because they turned against me. So I turned away from them. And I let their enemies defeat them. All of them died in war.
Ezekiel,39,24,I punished them for their uncleanness and their sins. I turned away from them.
Ezekiel,39,25,“So this is what the Lord God says: Now I will bring the people of Jacob back from captivity. I will have mercy on the whole nation of Israel. I will not let them dishonor me.
Ezekiel,39,26,The people will forget their shame. And they will forget how they rejected me. They will live in safety on their own land. No one will make them afraid.
Ezekiel,39,27,I will bring the people back from other lands. I will gather them from the lands of their enemies. That is how I will show that I am holy through my people. And many nations will see that I am holy.
Ezekiel,39,28,Then my people will know that I am the Lord their God. This is because I sent them into captivity among the nations. But then I brought them back to their own land. And I didn’t leave any behind.
Ezekiel,39,29,"I will not turn away from them anymore. I will put my Spirit into the people of Israel, says the Lord God.”"
Ezekiel,40,1,"It was the twenty-fifth year of our captivity. It was at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month. It was in the fourteenth year after Jerusalem was defeated. On that same day I felt the power of the Lord. He brought me to Jerusalem."
Ezekiel,40,2,In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel. He put me on a very high mountain. On the south of the mountain there were some buildings that looked like a city.
Ezekiel,40,3,"The Lord took me closer to the buildings. I saw a man who looked as if he were made of bronze. He was standing in the gateway. He had a cord made of linen and a stick in his hand, both for measuring."
Ezekiel,40,4,"The man said to me, “Human being, look with your eyes and hear with your ears. And pay attention to all that I will show you. That’s why you have been brought here. Tell the people of Israel all that you see.”"
Ezekiel,40,5,I saw a wall that surrounded the Temple. The measuring stick in the man’s hand was 10½ feet long. So the man measured the wall. It was 10½ feet thick and 10½ feet high.
Ezekiel,40,6,Then the man went to the east gate. He went up its steps and measured the opening of the gate. It was more than 10½ feet wide.
Ezekiel,40,7,There were rooms for the guards. They were 10½ feet long and 10½ feet wide. The walls that came out between the guards’ rooms were about 9 feet thick. And there was a gate next to the porch that faced the Temple. The opening of this gate was 10½ feet wide.
Ezekiel,40,8,Then the man measured the porch of the gate.
Ezekiel,40,9,It was about 14 feet deep. And its doors were 3½ feet thick. The porch of the gate faced the Temple.
Ezekiel,40,10,There were three little rooms on each side of the last gate. These three rooms measured the same on each side. The walls between each room were the same thickness.
Ezekiel,40,11,The man measured the width of the entrance to the gateway. It was 17½ feet wide. The length of the gate was about 23 feet.
Ezekiel,40,12,And there was a low wall about 21 inches high in front of each room. The rooms were 10½ feet on each side.
Ezekiel,40,13,The man measured the gateway from the roof of one room to the roof of the opposite room. It was about 44 feet from one door to the opposite door.
Ezekiel,40,14,The man also measured the porch. It was about 35 feet wide. The courtyard was around the porch.
Ezekiel,40,15,From the front of the outer side of the gate to the front of the porch of the inner side of the gate was 87½ feet.
Ezekiel,40,16,The rooms and porch had small windows on all sides. The windows were narrower on the side facing the gateway. Carvings of palm trees were on each inner wall of the rooms.
Ezekiel,40,17,Then the man brought me into the outer courtyard. I saw rooms and a pavement of stones. Thirty rooms were along the edge of the paved walkway.
Ezekiel,40,18,The pavement ran alongside the gates. It was as long as the gates were wide. This was the lower pavement.
Ezekiel,40,19,Then the man measured from the outer wall to the inner wall. The outer court between these two walls was 175 feet on the east and on the north.
Ezekiel,40,20,The man measured the length and width of the gate leading to the outer courtyard. It faced north.
Ezekiel,40,21,It had three rooms on each side. Its inner walls and its porch measured the same as the first gate. It was 87½ feet long. And it was 44 feet wide.
Ezekiel,40,22,"Its windows, porch and carvings of palm trees measured the same as the east gate. Seven steps went up to the gate. And the gate’s porch was opposite them."
Ezekiel,40,23,The inner courtyard had a gate across from the northern gate like the one on the east. The man measured it and found it was 175 feet from inner gate to outer gate.
Ezekiel,40,24,Then the man led me south. I saw a gate facing south. He measured its inner walls and its porch. They measured the same as the other gates.
Ezekiel,40,25,The gate and its porch had windows all around like the other gates. It was 87½ feet long and 44 feet wide.
Ezekiel,40,26,Seven steps went up to this gate. Its porch was in front of them. It had carvings of palm trees on its inner walls.
Ezekiel,40,27,A gate was on the south side of the inner courtyard. The man measured from gate to gate on the south side. It was 175 feet.
Ezekiel,40,28,Then the man brought me through the south gate to the inner courtyard. The inner south gate measured the same as the gates in the outer wall.
Ezekiel,40,29,"The inner south gate’s rooms, inner walls and porch measured the same as the gates in the outer wall. There were windows all around the gate and its porch. The gate was 87½ feet long and 44 feet wide."
Ezekiel,40,30,Each porch of each inner gate was about 44 feet long and about 9 feet wide.
Ezekiel,40,31,The inner south gate’s porch faced the outer courtyard. Carvings of palm trees were on its inside walls. Its stairway had eight steps.
Ezekiel,40,32,The man brought me into the inner courtyard on the east side. He measured the inner east gate. It measured the same as the other gates.
Ezekiel,40,33,"The inner east gate’s rooms, inside walls and porch measured the same as the other gates. Windows were all around the gate and its porch. The inner east gate was 87½ feet long and 44 feet wide."
Ezekiel,40,34,Its porch faced the outer courtyard. Carvings of palm trees were on its inner walls on each side. Its stairway had eight steps.
Ezekiel,40,35,Then the man brought me to the inner north gate. He measured it. It measured the same as the other gates.
Ezekiel,40,36,"Its rooms, inner walls and porch measured the same as the other gates. Windows were all around the gate. It was 87½ feet long and 44 feet wide."
Ezekiel,40,37,Its porch faced the outer courtyard. Carvings of palm trees were on its inner walls on each side. And its stairway had eight steps.
Ezekiel,40,38,There was a room with a door that opened onto the porch of the inner north gate. In this room the priests washed animals for the burnt offerings.
Ezekiel,40,39,"There were two tables on each side of the room. Animals for burnt offerings, sin offerings and penalty offerings were killed on these tables."
Ezekiel,40,40,"On each side of the porch, outside the door to the room, were two tables."
Ezekiel,40,41,So four tables were on one side of the gate. And four tables were on the other side of the gate. In all there were eight tables on which the priests killed animals for sacrifices.
Ezekiel,40,42,There were four tables of cut stone for the burnt offering. These tables were about 3 feet long and 3 feet wide. And they were about 2 feet high. On these tables the priests put their tools. They used the tools to kill animals for burnt offerings and the other sacrifices.
Ezekiel,40,43,Double hooks 3 inches long were put up on all the walls. The flesh for the offering was put on the tables.
Ezekiel,40,44,There were two rooms in the inner courtyard. One was beside the north gate. It faced south. The other room was beside the south gate. It faced north.
Ezekiel,40,45,"The man said to me, “The room which faces the south is for the priests. They serve in the Temple."
Ezekiel,40,46,And the room that faces north is for the priests who serve at the altar. These priests are descendants of Zadok. They are the only descendants of Levi who can come near the Lord to serve him.”
Ezekiel,40,47,The man measured the Temple courtyard. It was a perfect square. It was 175 feet long and 175 feet wide. The altar was in front of the Temple.
Ezekiel,40,48,The man brought me to the porch of the Temple. And he measured each wall of the porch. It was about 9 feet on each side. The gate was 24½ feet wide. The walls of the gate were about 5 feet on each side.
Ezekiel,40,49,"The porch was 35 feet long and 21 feet wide. Ten steps went up to the porch. Pillars were by the walls, one on each side of the entrance."
Ezekiel,41,1,The man brought me to the Holy Place. He measured its walls. They were 10½ feet wide on each side.
Ezekiel,41,2,The entrance was 17½ feet wide. The walls alongside the entrance were about 9 feet wide on each side. The man measured the Holy Place. It was 70 feet long and 35 feet wide.
Ezekiel,41,3,Then the man went inside. And he measured the walls of the doorway. Each was 3½ feet wide. The doorway was 10½ feet wide. The walls next to it were more than 12 feet thick.
Ezekiel,41,4,"Then the man measured the room at the end of the Holy Place. It was 35 feet long and 35 feet wide. The man said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.”"
Ezekiel,41,5,Then the man measured the wall of the Temple. It was 10½ feet wide. The side rooms were 7 feet wide all around the Temple.
Ezekiel,41,6,"The side rooms were on three different stories, each above the other. There were 30 rooms on each story. The side rooms had ledges on the wall all around. The rooms rested on the ledges but were not attached to the walls."
Ezekiel,41,7,The side rooms around the Temple were wider on each higher story. So rooms were wider on the top story. A stairway went up from the lowest story to the highest through the middle story.
Ezekiel,41,8,I also saw that the Temple had a raised base all around. It was the foundation for the side rooms and was 10½ feet thick.
Ezekiel,41,9,The outer wall of the side rooms was about 9 feet thick. There was an open area between the side rooms of the Temple
Ezekiel,41,10,and the priests’ rooms. It was 35 feet wide and went all around the Temple.
Ezekiel,41,11,The doors of the side rooms led to a paved base around the outside of the Temple. One door faced north. And the other door faced south. The paved base was about 9 feet wide all around.
Ezekiel,41,12,There was a building facing the Temple courtyard at the west side. It was 122½ feet wide. The wall of the building was about 9 feet thick all around. It was 157½ feet long.
Ezekiel,41,13,Then the man measured the Temple. The Temple was 175 feet long. This included the courtyard with the building and its walls. It was all 175 feet long.
Ezekiel,41,14,Also the eastern front of the Temple and its courtyard was 175 feet wide.
Ezekiel,41,15,"The man measured the length of the building facing the courtyard on the west side, including its side rooms. Its walls from one side to the other were 175 feet. The Holy Place, the Most Holy Place and the porch of the courtyard"
Ezekiel,41,16,"had wood panels on the walls. By the doorway, the Temple had wood panels on the walls. The wood covered all the walls from the floor up to the windows. The windows were covered with crossed strips of wood."
Ezekiel,41,17,In the space above the entrance to the Most Holy Place there were carvings. And on the outside and all the walls around the Most Holy Place and the Holy Place were carvings.
Ezekiel,41,18,The carvings were of creatures with wings and palm trees. A palm tree was between each carved creature. Every creature had two faces.
Ezekiel,41,19,One was a man’s face looking toward the palm tree on one side. The other was a lion’s face looking toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved all around the Temple wall.
Ezekiel,41,20,This was from the floor to above the door. Palm trees and creatures with wings were carved on all the walls of the Holy Place.
Ezekiel,41,21,The walls of the Holy Place were square. In front of the Most Holy Place was something that looked like
Ezekiel,41,22,"an altar of wood. It was more than 5 feet high and 3 feet wide. Its corners, base and sides were wood. The man said to me, “This is the table that is in the presence of the Lord.”"
Ezekiel,41,23,Both the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place had double doors.
Ezekiel,41,24,Each of the doors had two pieces that would swing open.
Ezekiel,41,25,Palm trees and creatures with wings were also carved on the doors of the Holy Place. They were like those carved on the walls. And there was a wood roof on the front Temple porch.
Ezekiel,41,26,There were windows and palm trees on both side walls of the porch. The side rooms of the Temple were also covered by a roof.
Ezekiel,42,1,Then the man led me north out into the outer courtyard. He led me to the rooms across from the Temple courtyard. The outer wall was north of these rooms.
Ezekiel,42,2,The building on the north side was 175 feet long and 87½ feet wide.
Ezekiel,42,3,"There was 35 feet of the Temple courtyard between this building and the Temple. On the other side, this building faced the stone pavement of the outer courtyard. The building had rooms and balconies on three stories."
Ezekiel,42,4,There was a hallway on the north side of the rooms. It was 17½ feet wide and 175 feet long. Doors led into the rooms from this hallway.
Ezekiel,42,5,The top rooms were narrower. This was because the balconies took more space from them. The rooms on the first and second stories of the building were wider.
Ezekiel,42,6,The rooms were on three stories. They did not have pillars like the pillars of the courtyards. So the top rooms were farther back than those on the first and second stories.
Ezekiel,42,7,There was a wall outside parallel to the rooms and to the outer courtyard. It ran in front of the rooms for 87½ feet.
Ezekiel,42,8,The row of rooms along the outer courtyard was 87½ feet long. The rooms that faced the Temple were about 175 feet long.
Ezekiel,42,9,The lower rooms had an entrance on the east end of the building. This was so a person could enter them from the courtyard.
Ezekiel,42,10,"There were rooms on the south side, parallel to the wall of the outer courtyard. They faced the Temple courtyard."
Ezekiel,42,11,These rooms had a hallway in front of them. They were like the rooms on the north. They had the same length and width. And the doors were the same.
Ezekiel,42,12,The doors of the south rooms were like the doors of the north rooms. There was a door at the east end of a hall. This hall went to all the rooms.
Ezekiel,42,13,"The man said to me, “The north and south rooms across from the Temple courtyard are holy rooms. There the priests who go near the Lord will eat the most holy offerings. There they will put the most holy offerings: the grain offerings, sin offerings and the penalty offerings."
Ezekiel,42,14,The priests who enter the Holy Place must leave their serving clothes there. Then they may go into the outer courtyard. This is because these clothes are holy. The priests must put on other clothes. Then they may go to the part of the Temple which is for the people.”
Ezekiel,42,15,The man finished measuring inside the Temple. Then he brought me out through the east gate. He measured the area all around.
Ezekiel,42,16,The man measured the east side with the measuring stick. It was 875 feet by the measuring stick.
Ezekiel,42,17,He measured the north side. It was 875 feet by the measuring stick.
Ezekiel,42,18,He measured the south side. It was 875 feet by the measuring stick.
Ezekiel,42,19,He went around to the west side. And it measured 875 feet by the measuring stick.
Ezekiel,42,20,So he measured the Temple on all four sides. The Temple had a wall all around it. It was 875 feet long and 875 feet wide. It separated the holy from that which is not holy.
Ezekiel,43,1,The man led me to the outer east gate.
Ezekiel,43,2,And I saw the greatness of the God of Israel coming from the east. God’s voice was like the roar of rushing water. His greatness made the earth shine.
Ezekiel,43,3,I saw a vision. It was like the vision I had seen when the Lord came to destroy the city. It was also like the vision I had seen by the Kebar River. I bowed facedown on the ground.
Ezekiel,43,4,The greatness of the Lord came into the Temple through the east gate.
Ezekiel,43,5,Then the Spirit picked me up. And he brought me into the inner courtyard. There the Lord’s greatness filled the Temple.
Ezekiel,43,6,The man stood at my side. I heard someone speaking to me from inside the Temple.
Ezekiel,43,7,"The voice from the Temple said to me, “Human being, this is my throne. And this is the place my feet rest. I will live here among the Israelites forever. The people of Israel will not make my holy name unclean again. Neither the people nor their kings will make it unclean by their sexual sins. Nor will they make it unclean with the dead bodies of their kings."
Ezekiel,43,8,"They made my name unclean by putting their doorway next to my doorway. And they put their doorpost next to my doorpost. Only a wall separated me from them. When they did their acts that I hate, they made my holy name unclean. So I destroyed them in my anger."
Ezekiel,43,9,Now let them stop their sexual sins. And let them take the dead bodies of their kings far away from me. Then I will live among them forever.
Ezekiel,43,10,"“Human being, tell the people of Israel about the Temple. Then they will be ashamed of their sins. Let them think about the plan of the Temple."
Ezekiel,43,11,"Then they will be ashamed of all they have done. Let them know the design of the Temple. Let them know how it is built. Show them its exits and entrances. Show them all its designs, all its rules and all its teachings. And write the rules as they watch. Do this so they can obey all the Temple’s teachings and rules."
Ezekiel,43,12,This is the teaching of the Temple: All the area around the top of the mountain is most holy. This is the teaching of the Temple.
Ezekiel,43,13,"“And these are the measurements of the altar, using the measuring stick. It is 21 inches long. The altar’s base is 21 inches high and 21 inches long. Its rim is about 9 inches around its edge. And the altar is this tall:"
Ezekiel,43,14,"From the ground up to the lower ledge, it measures 3½ feet. It is 21 inches wide. It measures 7 feet from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge and is 21 inches wide."
Ezekiel,43,15,The place where the sacrifice is burned on the altar is 7 feet high. The four corners are shaped like horns and reach up above it.
Ezekiel,43,16,It is square. It is 21 feet long and 21 feet wide.
Ezekiel,43,17,"The upper ledge is also square, 24½ feet long and 24½ feet wide. The border around it is 10½ inches wide. Its base is 21 inches around. Its steps are on the east.”"
Ezekiel,43,18,"Then the man said to me, “Human being, this is what the Lord God says: These are the rules for the altar. When it is built, use these rules to offer burnt offerings and sprinkle blood on it."
Ezekiel,43,19,"You must give a young bull as a sin offering to the priests. These priests are the Levites from the family of Zadok. They come near me to serve me, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,43,20,Take some of the bull’s blood and put it on the altar’s four corners. Put it also on the four corners of the ledge. And put it on the border all around. This is how you will make the altar pure and ready for God’s service.
Ezekiel,43,21,Then take the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the proper place in the Temple area. It will be outside the Holy Place.
Ezekiel,43,22,“On the second day offer a male goat. It must have nothing wrong with it. It will be for a sin offering. The priests will make the altar pure and ready for God’s service. They will do it the same way they did with the young bull.
Ezekiel,43,23,"When you finish making the altar pure and ready, offer a young bull and a male sheep from the flock. They must also have nothing wrong with them."
Ezekiel,43,24,You must offer them before the Lord. The priests will throw salt on them. Then they will offer them as a burnt offering to the Lord.
Ezekiel,43,25,"“You must prepare a goat every day for seven days as a sin offering. Also, you must prepare a young bull and male sheep from the flock. They must have nothing wrong with them."
Ezekiel,43,26,For seven days the priests will make the altar pure and ready for God’s service. Then the priests will give the altar to God.
Ezekiel,43,27,"After these seven days, on the eighth day, the priests must present your offerings. They must offer your burnt offerings and your fellowship offerings on the altar. Then I will accept you, says the Lord God.”"
Ezekiel,44,1,Then the man brought me back to the outer east gate of the Temple area. The gate was shut.
Ezekiel,44,2,"The Lord said to me, “This gate will stay shut. It will not be opened. No one may enter through it. This is because the Lord God of Israel has entered through it. So it must stay shut."
Ezekiel,44,3,Only the ruler himself may sit in the gateway to eat bread before the Lord. He must enter through the porch of the gateway and go out the same way.”
Ezekiel,44,4,Then the man brought me through the outer north gate. He brought me to the front of the Temple. I looked and saw the greatness of the Lord. It was filling the Temple of the Lord. I bowed facedown on the ground.
Ezekiel,44,5,"The Lord said to me, “Human being, pay attention. See this with your eyes. And hear this with your ears. See and hear everything I tell you about all the rules and teachings of the Temple of the Lord. Pay attention to the entrance to the Temple and to all the exits from the Temple area."
Ezekiel,44,6,"Then speak to those who refuse to obey. Say to the people of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Stop doing all your acts that I hate, Israel!"
Ezekiel,44,7,"You brought foreigners into my Holy Place. They were not circumcised in the flesh. They had not given themselves to serving me. You dishonored my Temple when you offered me food, fat and blood. You broke my agreement by all your ways that I hate."
Ezekiel,44,8,And you have not taken care of my holy things. You put foreigners in charge of my Temple.
Ezekiel,44,9,This is what the Lord God says: Foreigners who are not circumcised in flesh and who do not give themselves to serving me may not enter my Temple. Even a foreigner living among the people of Israel may not enter.
Ezekiel,44,10,“‘Some Levites stopped obeying me when Israel left me and followed their idols. These Levites must be punished for their sin.
Ezekiel,44,11,These Levites are to be servants in my Holy Place. They may guard the gates of the Temple. They may serve in the Temple. They may kill the animals for the burnt offering and the sacrifices for the people. They may stand before the people to serve them.
Ezekiel,44,12,"But these Levites helped the people worship their idols and caused the people of Israel to fall. So I have made this promise: They will be punished for their sin, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,44,13,They will not come near me to serve as priests. They will not come near any of my holy things or the most holy offerings. But they will be ashamed of the things they did that I hate.
Ezekiel,44,14,But I will make them take care of the Temple. They will take care of everything that must be done in it.
Ezekiel,44,15,"“‘But this is not true for priests who are Levites and descendants of Zadok. They took care of my Holy Place when Israel left me. They may come near to serve me. They may stand in my presence. They will offer me the fat and blood of the animals they sacrifice, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,44,16,They are the only ones who may enter my Holy Place. They may come near my table to serve me. They may take care of the things I gave them.
Ezekiel,44,17,"“‘When they enter the gates of the inner courtyard, they must wear linen robes. They must not wear wool to serve at the gates of the inner courtyard or in the Temple."
Ezekiel,44,18,They will wear linen turbans on their heads and linen underclothes. They will not wear anything that makes them perspire.
Ezekiel,44,19,"At times they will go out into the outer courtyard to the people. But before they go, they must take off their serving clothes. They must put these clothes away in the holy rooms. And they must put on other clothes. Then they will not let their holy clothes hurt the people."
Ezekiel,44,20,“‘They must not shave their heads or let their hair grow long. They must keep the hair of their heads trimmed.
Ezekiel,44,21,None of the priests may drink wine when they enter the inner courtyard.
Ezekiel,44,22,The priests must not marry a widow or a divorced woman. They may marry only virgins from the people of Israel. Or they may marry a widow of a priest.
Ezekiel,44,23,They must teach my people the difference between what is holy and what is not holy. They must help my people know what is unclean and what is clean.
Ezekiel,44,24,"“‘In court they will act as judges. When they judge, they will follow my teachings. They must obey my laws and my rules at all my special feasts. They must keep my Sabbaths holy."
Ezekiel,44,25,"“‘They must not go near a dead person, making themselves unclean. But they are allowed to make themselves unclean if the dead person is a relative. It might be his father, mother, son, daughter, brother or a sister who has not married."
Ezekiel,44,26,"After the priest has been made clean again, he must wait seven days."
Ezekiel,44,27,"Then he may go into the inner courtyard to serve in the Temple. But he must offer a sin offering for himself, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,44,28,“‘These are the rules about the priests and their property: They will have me instead of property. You will not give them any land to own in Israel. I am what they will own.
Ezekiel,44,29,"They will eat the grain offerings, sin offerings and penalty offerings. Everything Israel offers will be theirs."
Ezekiel,44,30,And the best fruits of all the first harvests will be for the priests. And they will have all the special gifts offered to me. You will also give to the priests the first part of your grain that you grind. This will cause a blessing to come on your house.
Ezekiel,44,31,The priests must not eat any bird or animal that died a natural death. And they must not eat one that has been torn by wild animals.
Ezekiel,45,1,“‘Divide the land for the Israelite tribes by throwing lots. At that time you will give a part of the land to belong to the Lord. It will be about 7 miles long and about 6 miles wide. All of this land will be holy.
Ezekiel,45,2,An area of 875 feet square will be for the Temple. There will be an open space around the Temple that is 87½ feet wide.
Ezekiel,45,3,In the holy area you will measure a part about 7 miles long and 3 miles wide. The Most Holy Place will be in this holy area.
Ezekiel,45,4,This holy part of the land will be for the priests who serve in the Temple. This is where they come near to serve the Lord. It will be a place for the priests’ houses. And it will be the place for the Temple.
Ezekiel,45,5,"Another area will be about 7 miles long and more than 3 miles wide. It will be for the Levites, who serve in the Temple. It will belong to them so they will have cities in which to live."
Ezekiel,45,6,“‘And you will give the city an area that is about 1½ miles wide and about 7 miles long. It will be along the side of the holy area. It will belong to all the people of Israel.
Ezekiel,45,7,"“‘The ruler will have land on both sides of the holy area and the city. On the west of the holy area, his land will reach to the Mediterranean Sea. On the east of the holy area, his land will reach to the eastern border. It will be as long as the land given to each tribe."
Ezekiel,45,8,This land will be the ruler’s property in Israel. So my rulers will not be cruel to my people anymore. But they will give land to each tribe in the nation of Israel.
Ezekiel,45,9,"“‘This is what the Lord God says: You have gone far enough, you rulers of Israel! Stop being cruel and hurting people. Do what is right and fair. Stop forcing my people out of their homes, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,45,10,"You must have honest scales, an honest dry measurement and an honest liquid measurement."
Ezekiel,45,11,The dry measure and the liquid measure will be the same: The liquid measure will always be a tenth of a homer. The ephah will always be a tenth of a homer. The measurement they follow will be the homer.
Ezekiel,45,12,The shekel will be worth 20 gerahs. A mina will be worth 60 shekels.
Ezekiel,45,13,“‘This is the gift you will offer: a sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat; a sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley.
Ezekiel,45,14,The amount of oil you are to offer is a tenth of a bath from each cor. (Ten baths make a homer and also make a cor.)
Ezekiel,45,15,"You should give 1 sheep from each flock of 200 from the watering places of Israel. They are to be offered with the grain offerings, burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. These offerings are to remove sins so you will belong to God, says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,45,16,All people in the land will give this special offering for the ruler of Israel.
Ezekiel,45,17,"It will be the ruler’s responsibility to supply the burnt offerings, grain offerings and drink offerings. These offerings will be given at the feasts and at the New Moons. They will also be given on the Sabbaths and at all the other feasts of Israel. The ruler will supply the sin offerings, grain offerings and fellowship offerings. These offerings are to pay for the sins of Israel."
Ezekiel,45,18,“‘This is what the Lord God says: On the first day of the first month take a young bull that has nothing wrong with it. Use it to make the Temple pure and ready for God’s service.
Ezekiel,45,19,The priest will take some of the blood from the sin offering. And he will put it on the doorposts of the Temple. He will put it on the four corners of the ledge of the altar. And he will put it on the posts of the gate of the inner courtyard.
Ezekiel,45,20,You will do the same thing on the seventh day of the month. You will do it for anyone who has sinned by accident or without knowing it. This is how you make the Temple pure and ready for God’s service.
Ezekiel,45,21,“‘On the fourteenth day of the first month you will celebrate the Feast of Passover. It will be a feast of seven days when you eat bread made without yeast.
Ezekiel,45,22,On that day the ruler must offer a bull for himself and for all the people of the land. The bull will be a sin offering.
Ezekiel,45,23,During the seven days of the feast the ruler must offer seven bulls. And he must offer seven male sheep. The bulls and sheep must have nothing wrong with them. They will be burnt offerings to the Lord. The ruler will offer them every day of the seven days of the feast. He must also offer a male goat every day as a sin offering.
Ezekiel,45,24,The ruler must give as a grain offering a half bushel for each bull and a half bushel for each sheep. He must give a gallon of olive oil for each half bushel.
Ezekiel,45,25,"“‘Beginning on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, you will celebrate the Feast of Shelters. During the feast, the ruler will do the same things for seven days. He will supply the sin offering, burnt offering, grain offering and the olive oil."
Ezekiel,46,1,“‘This is what the Lord God says: The east gate of the inner courtyard will be shut on the six working days. But it will be opened on the Sabbath day. And it will be open on the day of the New Moon.
Ezekiel,46,2,The ruler will enter through the porch of the gateway. He will enter from outside and stand by the gatepost. Then the priests will offer the ruler’s burnt offering and fellowship offerings. The ruler will worship at the entrance of the gate. Then he will go out. But the gate will not be shut until evening.
Ezekiel,46,3,The people of the land will worship at the entrance of that gateway. They will worship there in the presence of the Lord on the Sabbaths and New Moons.
Ezekiel,46,4,This is the burnt offering the ruler will offer to the Lord on the Sabbath day. It will be six male lambs that have nothing wrong with them. And it will be a male sheep that has nothing wrong with it.
Ezekiel,46,5,He must give a half bushel grain offering with the male sheep. But he can give as much grain offering with the lambs as he pleases. He must also give a gallon of olive oil for each half bushel of grain.
Ezekiel,46,6,On the day of the New Moon he must offer a young bull. It must have nothing wrong with it. He must also offer six lambs and a male sheep. They also must have nothing wrong with them.
Ezekiel,46,7,"The ruler must give a half bushel grain offering with the bull. And he must give the same with the male sheep. With the lambs, he can give as much grain as he pleases. But he must give a gallon of olive oil for each half bushel of grain."
Ezekiel,46,8,"And when the ruler enters, he must go in through the porch of the gateway. He must go out the same way."
Ezekiel,46,9,“‘The people of the land must come before the Lord at the special feasts. Anyone who enters through the north gate to worship must go out through the south gate. Anyone who enters through the south gate must go out through the north gate. No one will return the same way he entered. Each person will go out straight ahead.
Ezekiel,46,10,"When the people go in, the ruler will go in with them. When they go out, the ruler will go out."
Ezekiel,46,11,"“‘At the feasts and regular times of worship a half bushel of grain must be offered. It will be offered with a young bull. And a half bushel of grain must be offered with a male sheep. But with an offering of lambs, the ruler may give as much grain as he pleases. He should give a gallon of olive oil for each half bushel of grain."
Ezekiel,46,12,"The ruler may give an offering as a special gift to the Lord. It may be a burnt offering or fellowship offering. When he gives it to the Lord, the inner east gate will be opened for him. He must offer his burnt offering and his fellowship offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he will go out. After he has gone out, the gate will be shut."
Ezekiel,46,13,“‘Every morning you will give a year-old lamb that has nothing wrong with it. It will be for a burnt offering to the Lord every day.
Ezekiel,46,14,"Also, you must offer a grain offering with the lamb every morning. With it you will give three and a third quarts of grain and one and a third quarts of olive oil. This is to make the fine flour moist. It will be a grain offering to the Lord. This is a rule that must be kept from now on."
Ezekiel,46,15,"So they must always give the lamb, the grain offering and the olive oil every morning as a burnt offering."
Ezekiel,46,16,“‘This is what the Lord God says: The ruler might give a gift from his land to one of his sons. Then that land will belong to that son’s children. It is their property from their family.
Ezekiel,46,17,But the ruler might give a gift from his land to one of his slaves. That land will belong to the slave only until the year of freedom. Then the land will go back to the ruler. Only the ruler’s sons may keep a gift of land from the ruler.
Ezekiel,46,18,The ruler must not take any of the people’s land. He must not force them out of their land. He must give his sons land from his own land. Then my people will not be scattered out of their own land.’”
Ezekiel,46,19,The man led me through the entrance at the side of the gateway. He led me to the priests’ holy rooms that face north. There I saw a place at the west end.
Ezekiel,46,20,"The man said to me, “This is where the priests will boil the meat of the penalty offering and sin offering. There the priests will bake the grain offering. Then they will not need to bring these offerings into the outer courtyard. That would hurt the people.”"
Ezekiel,46,21,Then the man brought me out to the outer courtyard. He led me to its four corners. In each corner of the courtyard was a smaller courtyard.
Ezekiel,46,22,Small courtyards were in the four corners of the courtyard. Each small courtyard was 70 feet long and 52½ feet wide. All four corners measured the same.
Ezekiel,46,23,A stone wall was around each of the four small courtyards. Places for cooking were built in each of the stone walls.
Ezekiel,46,24,"The man said to me, “These are the kitchens. The Temple priests will boil the sacrifices for the people here.”"
Ezekiel,47,1,The man led me back to the door of the Temple. I saw water coming out from under the doorway that faces east. (The Temple faced east.) The water flowed down from the south end of the Temple. It was south of the altar.
Ezekiel,47,2,The man brought me out through the outer north gate. And he led me around outside to the outer east gate. The water was coming out on the south side of the gate.
Ezekiel,47,3,The man went toward the east with a line in his hand. He measured about a third of a mile. Then he led me through water that came up to my ankles.
Ezekiel,47,4,The man measured about a third of a mile again. Then he led me through water that came up to my knees. Then he measured about a third of a mile again. And he led me through water up to my waist.
Ezekiel,47,5,The man measured about a third of a mile again. But it was now a river that I could not cross. The water had risen too high. It was deep enough for swimming. It was a river that no one could cross.
Ezekiel,47,6,"The man asked me, “Human being, do you see this?” Then the man led me back along the bank of the river."
Ezekiel,47,7,"As I went back, I saw many trees on both sides of the water."
Ezekiel,47,8,"The man said to me, “This water will flow toward the eastern areas. It will go down into the Jordan Valley. When the water enters the Dead Sea, it will become fresh."
Ezekiel,47,9,"And everywhere the river goes, there will be many animals and fish. Wherever this water goes the Dead Sea will become fresh. So where the river goes there will be many living things."
Ezekiel,47,10,Fishermen will stand by the sea. From En Gedi all the way to En Eglaim will become a place to spread fishing nets. There will be many kinds of fish in the Dead Sea. There will be as many kinds of fish as there are in the Mediterranean Sea.
Ezekiel,47,11,But the swamps and marshes will not become fresh. They will be left for salt.
Ezekiel,47,12,All kinds of fruit trees will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will not dry and die. The trees will have fruit every month because the water for them comes from the Temple. The fruit from the trees will be for food. And their leaves will be for medicine.”
Ezekiel,47,13,This is what the Lord God says: “These are the borders to divide the land among the 12 tribes of Israel. Joseph will have two parts of land.
Ezekiel,47,14,You will divide the land equally. I promised to give it to your ancestors. So this land will belong to you from your family.
Ezekiel,47,15,"“This will be the border line of the land. “On the north side it will start at the Mediterranean Sea. It will go by the Hethlon Road. This is where the road turns toward Lebo Hamath. And it will go to the cities of Zedad,"
Ezekiel,47,16,Berothah and Sibraim. Sibraim is on the border between Damascus and Hamath. And it will go on to the city of Hazer Hatticon on the border of the country of Hauran.
Ezekiel,47,17,So the border line will go from the Mediterranean Sea east to the city of Hazar Enan. This is on the northern border of Damascus. And the country of Hamath will be on the north side of the border.
Ezekiel,47,18,“On the east side the border runs south from a point between Hauran and Damascus. It will go along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel. It will continue to the city of Tamar on the Dead Sea. This will be the east side of the land.
Ezekiel,47,19,“On the south side the border line will go west from Tamar. It will go all the way to the waters of Meribah Kadesh. Then it will run along the brook of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. This will be the south side of the land.
Ezekiel,47,20,“On the west side the Mediterranean Sea will be the border line. It will go to a place across from Lebo Hamath. This will be the west side of your land.
Ezekiel,47,21,“So you will divide this land among the tribes of Israel.
Ezekiel,47,22,You will divide it as a property for yourselves. And it will be for you and for the foreigners who live and have children among you. These foreigners will be like people born in Israel. You will divide some land for them among the tribes of Israel.
Ezekiel,47,23,"In whatever tribe the foreigner lives, you will give him some land,” says the Lord God."
Ezekiel,48,1,“These are the names of the tribes. Dan will have one share. It will begin at the northern border. It will go from the sea and over the Hethlon Road. It will follow the road to Lebo Hamath. It will go all the way to Hazar Enan. This is on the northern border of Damascus. It will stop there next to Hamath. This will be Dan’s northern border from the east side to the Mediterranean Sea on the west side.
Ezekiel,48,2,"“South of Dan’s border, Asher will have one share. It will go from the east side to the west side."
Ezekiel,48,3,"“South of Asher’s border, Naphtali will have one share. It will go from the east side to the west side."
Ezekiel,48,4,"“South of Naphtali’s border, Manasseh will have one share. It will go from the east side to the west side."
Ezekiel,48,5,"“South of Manasseh’s border, Ephraim will have one share. It will go from the east side to the west side."

And it will extend west of it to the Mediterranean Sea. Both of these areas run the length of the lands of the tribes. They belong to the ruler. The holy area with the Holy Place of the Temple will be in the middle.
