James,1,1,"James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,
T o the twelve tribes who are in the Dispersion: Greetings."
James,1,2,"Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you encounter various trials"
James,1,3,knowing that the testing of your faith brings about perseverance.
James,1,4,"And let perseverance have its perfect work, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing."
James,1,5,"But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him."
James,1,6,"But he must ask in faith, doubting nothing, for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind."
James,1,7,For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord
James,1,8,"being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways."
James,1,9,But the brother of humble circumstances is to boast in his high position
James,1,10,"and the rich man is to boast in his humiliation, because like flowering grass he will pass away."
James,1,11,For the sun rises with a scorching heat and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so too the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will fade away.
James,1,12,"Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him."
James,1,13,"Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone."
James,1,14,But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.
James,1,15,"Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is fully matured, it brings forth death."
James,1,16,"Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers."
James,1,17,"Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow."
James,1,18,"In the exercise of His will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits among His creatures."
James,1,19,"Know this, my beloved brothers. But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger"
James,1,20,for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God.
James,1,21,"Therefore, laying aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness, in gentleness receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls."
James,1,22,"But become doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves."
James,1,23,"For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror"
James,1,24,"for once he looked at himself and has gone away, he immediately forgot what kind of person he was."
James,1,25,"But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of freedom, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does."
James,1,26,"If anyone thinks himself to be religious while not bridling his tongue but deceiving his own heart, this man’s religion is worthless."
James,1,27,"Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world."
James,2,1,"My brothers, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism."
James,2,2,"For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in bright clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in dirty clothes"
James,2,3,"and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the bright clothes, and say, “You sit here in a good place,” and you say to the poor man, “You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool,”"
James,2,4,"have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?"
James,2,5,"Listen, my beloved brothers: did not God choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?"
James,2,6,But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you and they themselves drag you into court?
James,2,7,Do they not blaspheme the good name by which you have been called?
James,2,8,"If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, “YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF,” you are doing well."
James,2,9,"But if you show partiality, you are committing sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors."
James,2,10,"For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all."
James,2,11,"For He who said, “DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY,” also said, “DO NOT MURDER.” Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law."
James,2,12,So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of freedom.
James,2,13,For judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
James,2,14,"What use is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him?"
James,2,15,If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food
James,2,16,"and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,” and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that?"
James,2,17,"Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead by itself."
James,2,18,"But someone will say, “You have faith; and I have works. Show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.”"
James,2,19,"You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder."
James,2,20,"But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless?"
James,2,21,Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?
James,2,22,"You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected."
James,2,23,"And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “AND ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS COUNTED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS,” and he was called the friend of God."
James,2,24,You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.
James,2,25,"And in the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?"
James,2,26,"For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead."
James,3,1,"Do not, many of you, become teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive a stricter judgment."
James,3,2,"For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the entire body as well."
James,3,3,"Now if we put the bits into the horses’ mouths so that they will obey us, we direct their entire body as well."
James,3,4,"Look at the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, they are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot wills."
James,3,5,"So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things.
B ehold how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire!"
James,3,6,"And the tongue is a fire, the very world of unrighteousness; the tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body, and sets on fire the course of our existence, and is set on fire by hell."
James,3,7,"For every kind of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind."
James,3,8,But no one can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil and full of deadly poison.
James,3,9,"With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God."
James,3,10,"From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so."
James,3,11,Does a fountain pour forth from the same opening fresh and bitter water?
James,3,12,"Can a fig tree, my brothers, produce olives, or a vine produce figs? Nor can saltwater produce fresh."
James,3,13,Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good conduct his works in the gentleness of wisdom.
James,3,14,"But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth."
James,3,15,"This wisdom is not coming down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic."
James,3,16,"For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil practice."
James,3,17,"But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruits, without doubting, without hypocrisy."
James,3,18,And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
James,4,1,What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members?
James,4,2,"You lust and do not have, so you murder. You are envious and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask."
James,4,3,"You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures."
James,4,4,"You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity toward God? Therefore, whoever wishes to be a friend of the world sets himself as an enemy of God."
James,4,5,Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose: “He jealously desires the Spirit which He has made to dwell in us”?
James,4,6,"But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, “GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.”"
James,4,7,Be subject therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
James,4,8,"Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded."
James,4,9,Be miserable and mourn and cry. Let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to gloom.
James,4,10,"Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you."
James,4,11,"Do not slander one another, brothers. He who slanders a brother or judges his brother, slanders the law and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge of it."
James,4,12,"There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you who judge your neighbor?"
James,4,13,"Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.”"
James,4,14,Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.
James,4,15,"Instead, you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that.”"
James,4,16,"But as it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil."
James,4,17,"Therefore, to one who knows to do the right thing and does not do it, to him it is sin."
James,5,1,"Come now, you rich, cry, howling over your miseries which are coming upon you."
James,5,2,Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten.
James,5,3,"Your gold and your silver have rusted, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire. You have stored up such treasure in the last days!"
James,5,4,"Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields—that which has been withheld by you—cries out against you; and the outcries of those who did the harvesting have reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth."
James,5,5,You have lived luxuriously on the earth and lived in self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts in a DAY OF SLAUGHTER.
James,5,6,You have condemned and murdered the righteous man; he does not resist you.
James,5,7,"Therefore be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the soil, being patient about it, until it receives the early and late rains."
James,5,8,"You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand."
James,5,9,"Do not groan, brothers, against one another, so that you yourselves may not be judged. Behold, the Judge is standing right at the door."
James,5,10,"As an example, brothers, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord."
James,5,11,"Behold, we count those blessed who persevere. You have heard of the perseverance of Job and have seen the outcome of the Lord’s dealings, that the Lord is full of compassion and is merciful."
James,5,12,"But above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath. But let your yes be yes, and your no, no, so that you may not fall under judgment."
James,5,13,Is anyone among you suffering? Then he must pray. Is anyone cheerful? He is to sing praises.
James,5,14,"Is anyone among you sick? Then he must call for the elders of the church and they are to pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord."
James,5,15,"And the prayer offered in faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him."
James,5,16,"Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much."
James,5,17,"Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months."
James,5,18,"Then he prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the earth produced its fruit."
James,5,19,"My brothers, if any among you strays from the truth and one turns him back"
James,5,20,let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will COVER A MULTITUDE OF SINS.
