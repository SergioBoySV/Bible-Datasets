3 John,1,1,"The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth."
3 John,1,2,"Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers."
3 John,1,3,"For I rejoiced greatly when brothers came and bore witness to your truth, that is, how you are walking in truth."
3 John,1,4,"I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my children are walking in the truth."
3 John,1,5,"Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever work you do for the brothers, and are doing this though they are strangers"
3 John,1,6,and they bore witness to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.
3 John,1,7,"For they went out for the sake of the Name, receiving nothing from the Gentiles."
3 John,1,8,"Therefore we ought to support such men, so that we may be fellow workers with the truth."
3 John,1,9,"I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not welcome what we say."
3 John,1,10,"For this reason, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his deeds which he does, unjustly disparaging us with wicked words. And not satisfied with this, he himself does not welcome the brothers either, and he forbids those who want to do so and puts them out of the church."
3 John,1,11,"Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God."
3 John,1,12,"Demetrius has received a good witness from everyone, and from the truth itself; and we add our witness, and you know that our witness is true."
3 John,1,13,"I had many things to write to you, but I am not willing to write them to you with pen and ink"
3 John,1,14,"but I hope to see you shortly, and we will speak face to face."
3 John,1,15,Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
