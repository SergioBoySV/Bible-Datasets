“HOLY, HOLY, HOLY is THE LORD GOD, THE ALMIGHTY, WHO WAS AND WHO IS AND WHO IS TO COME.”"
Revelation,4,9,"And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever"
Revelation,4,10,"the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and will worship Him who lives forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying"
Revelation,4,11,"“Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power, for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created.”"
Revelation,5,1,"Then I saw in the right hand of Him who sits on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals."
Revelation,5,2,"Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?”"
Revelation,5,3,And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it.
Revelation,5,4,Then I was crying greatly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.
Revelation,5,5,"And one of the elders *said to me, “Stop crying! Behold, the Lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so as to open the scroll and its seven seals.”"
Revelation,5,6,"Then I saw in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing, as if slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth."
Revelation,5,7,And He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sits on the throne.
Revelation,5,8,"And when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints."
Revelation,5,9,"And they *sang a new song, saying,
“Worthy are You to take the scroll and to open its seals, because You were slain and purchased for God with Your blood people from every tribe and tongue and people and nation."
Revelation,5,10,"And You made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will reign upon the earth.”"
Revelation,5,11,"Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands"
Revelation,5,12,"saying with a loud voice,
“Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.”"
Revelation,5,13,"And every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all things in them, I heard saying,
“To Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever.”"
Revelation,5,14,"And the four living creatures kept saying, “Amen.” And the elders fell down and worshiped."
Revelation,6,1,"Then I looked when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, “Come.”"
Revelation,6,2,"Then I looked, and behold, a white horse, and he who sits on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out overcoming and to overcome."
Revelation,6,3,"And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come.”"

Revelation,6,8,"Then I looked, and behold, a pale horse; and he who sits on it had the name Death, and Hades was following with him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth."
Revelation,6,9,"And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God, and because of the witness which they had maintained"
Revelation,6,10,"and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, “How long, O Master, holy and true? Will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?”"
Revelation,6,11,"And a white robe was given to each of them; and it was told to them that they should rest for a little while longer, until the number of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were to be killed even as they had been, would be completed also."
Revelation,6,12,"Then I looked when He opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood"
Revelation,6,13,"and the stars of the sky fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind."
Revelation,6,14,"And the sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places."
Revelation,6,15,Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the commanders and the rich and the strong and every slave and free man HID THEMSELVES IN THE CAVES and among the rocks of the mountains
Revelation,6,16,"and they *SAID TO THE MOUNTAINS AND TO THE ROCKS, “FALL ON US AND HIDE US from the presence of Him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb"
Revelation,6,17,"for the great DAY OF their WRATH has come, and who is able to stand?”"
Revelation,7,1,"After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree."
Revelation,7,2,"Then I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea"
Revelation,7,3,"saying, “Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the slaves of our God on their foreheads.”"
Revelation,7,4,"And I heard the number of those having been sealed, 144,000 sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel"

Revelation,7,10,"and they cry out with a loud voice, saying,
“ S alvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.”"
Revelation,7,11,"And all the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God"
Revelation,7,12,"saying,
“ A men, the blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the strength, be to our God forever and ever. Amen.”"
Revelation,7,13,"Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, “These, clothed in the white robes, who are they, and from where have they come?”"
Revelation,7,14,"And I said to him, “My lord, you know.” And he said to me, “These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
Revelation,7,15,"For this reason, they are before the throne of God; and they serve Him day and night in His sanctuary; and He who sits on the throne will dwell over them."
Revelation,7,16,"THEY WILL HUNGER NO LONGER, NOR THIRST ANYMORE; NOR WILL THE SUN BEAT DOWN ON THEM, NOR ANY HEAT"
Revelation,7,17,for the Lamb at the center of the throne will shepherd them and will guide them to springs of the water of life. And God WILL WIPE EVERY TEAR FROM THEIR EYES.”
Revelation,8,1,"When He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour."
Revelation,8,2,"Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them."
Revelation,8,3,"And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, so that he might add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne."
Revelation,8,4,"And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints, out of the angel’s hand, before God."
Revelation,8,5,"Then the angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it to the earth; and there followed peals of thunder and sounds and flashes of lightning and an earthquake."
Revelation,8,6,And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.
Revelation,8,7,"And the first sounded, and there came hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up."
Revelation,8,8,"And the second angel sounded, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea; and a third of the sea became blood"
Revelation,8,9,and a third of the creatures which were in the sea—those which had life—died; and a third of the ships were destroyed.
Revelation,8,10,"And the third angel sounded, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of waters."
Revelation,8,11,"And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter."
Revelation,8,12,"And the fourth angel sounded, and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were struck, so that a third of them would be darkened and the day would not shine for a third of it, and the night in the same way."
Revelation,8,13,"Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven, saying with a loud voice, “Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!”"
Revelation,9,1,"Then the fifth angel sounded. Then I saw a star from heaven which had fallen to the earth, and the key of the pit of the abyss was given to him."
Revelation,9,2,"And he opened the pit of the abyss and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit."
Revelation,9,3,"Then out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power."
Revelation,9,4,"And they were told not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads."
Revelation,9,5,"And they were not permitted to kill anyone, but to torment for five months, and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a man."
Revelation,9,6,"And in those days men will seek death and will never find it; they will long to die, and death flees from them."
Revelation,9,7,"And the appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. And on their heads appeared to be crowns like gold, and their faces were like the faces of men."
Revelation,9,8,"And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions."
Revelation,9,9,"And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, of many horses running to battle."
Revelation,9,10,"And they have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men for five months."
Revelation,9,11,"They have as king over them, the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek he has the name Apollyon."
Revelation,9,12,"One woe is past; behold, two woes are still coming after these things."
Revelation,9,13,"Then the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God"
Revelation,9,14,"one saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who have been bound at the great river Euphrates.”"
Revelation,9,15,"And the four angels were released, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, so that they would kill a third of mankind."
Revelation,9,16,And the number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million; I heard the number of them.
Revelation,9,17,And this is how I saw in the vision the horses and those who sit on them: the riders had breastplates the color of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone; and the heads of the horses are like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths come fire and smoke and brimstone.
Revelation,9,18,"A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which came out of their mouths."
Revelation,9,19,"For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads, and with them they do harm."
Revelation,9,20,"And the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so as not to worship demons, and the idols of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk."
Revelation,9,21,And they did not repent of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their sexual immorality nor of their thefts.
Revelation,10,1,"Then I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud, and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire"
Revelation,10,2,and he had in his hand a little scroll which was open. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left on the earth
Revelation,10,3,"and he cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion roars. And when he had cried out, the seven peals of thunder uttered their voices."
Revelation,10,4,"And when the seven peals of thunder had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up the things which the seven peals of thunder have spoken and do not write them.”"
Revelation,10,5,"Then the angel, whom I saw standing on the sea and on the earth, lifted up his right hand to heaven"
Revelation,10,6,"and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, WHO CREATED HEAVEN AND THE THINGS IN IT, AND THE EARTH AND THE THINGS IN IT, AND THE SEA AND THE THINGS IN IT, that there will be delay no longer"
Revelation,10,7,"but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as He proclaimed good news to His slaves, the prophets."
Revelation,10,8,"Then the voice which I heard from heaven, I heard again speaking with me, and saying, “Go, take the scroll which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the earth.”"
Revelation,10,9,"So I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little scroll. And he *said to me, “Take it and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.”"
Revelation,10,10,"And I took the little scroll out of the angel’s hand and ate it, and in my mouth it was sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter."
Revelation,10,11,"And they *said to me, “You must prophesy again about many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.”"
Revelation,11,1,"Then a measuring rod like a staff was given to me, saying, “Get up and measure the sanctuary of God and the altar, and those who worship in it."
Revelation,11,2,"And leave out the court which is outside the sanctuary and do not measure it, for it has been given to the Gentiles, and they will trample the holy city under foot for forty-two months."
Revelation,11,3,"And I will give authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.”"
Revelation,11,4,These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
Revelation,11,5,"And if anyone wishes to harm them, fire comes out of their mouth and devours their enemies; so if anyone wishes to harm them, he must be killed in this way."
Revelation,11,6,"These have the authority to shut up the sky, so that rain will not fall during the days of their prophesying; they also have authority over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they wish."
Revelation,11,7,"And when they have finished their witness, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them and overcome them and kill them."
Revelation,11,8,"And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified."
Revelation,11,9,"And those from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not permit their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb."
Revelation,11,10,"And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate and send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth."
Revelation,11,11,"But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God came into them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell upon those who were watching them."
Revelation,11,12,"And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” Then they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies watched them."
Revelation,11,13,"And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven."
Revelation,11,14,"The second woe is past; behold, the third woe is coming quickly."
Revelation,11,15,"Then the seventh angel sounded, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying,
“ T he kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.”"
Revelation,11,16,"And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God"
Revelation,11,17,"saying,
“ W e give You thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have begun to reign."
Revelation,11,18,"And the nations were enraged, and Your rage came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and to give reward to Your slaves—the prophets and the saints and those who fear Your name, the small and the great—and to destroy those who destroy the earth.”"
Revelation,11,19,"And the sanctuary of God which is in heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant appeared in His sanctuary, and there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder and an earthquake and a great hailstorm."
Revelation,12,1,"And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars."
Revelation,12,2,"And she was with child, and she *cried out, being in labor and in pain to give birth."
Revelation,12,3,"Then another sign appeared in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems."
Revelation,12,4,"And his tail *swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child."
Revelation,12,5,"And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne."
Revelation,12,6,"Then the woman fled into the wilderness where she *had a place prepared by God, so that there she would be nourished for 1,260 days."
Revelation,12,7,"And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war"
Revelation,12,8,"and they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven."
Revelation,12,9,"And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him."
Revelation,12,10,"Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying,
“ N ow the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, he who accuses them before our God day and night."
Revelation,12,11,"And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their witness, and they did not love their life even to death."
Revelation,12,12,"For this reason, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has only a short time.”"
Revelation,12,13,"And when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child."
Revelation,12,14,"But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, so that she could fly into the wilderness to her place, where she *was nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent."
Revelation,12,15,"And the serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, so that he might cause her to be swept away with the flood."
Revelation,12,16,"But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon poured out of his mouth."
Revelation,12,17,"So the dragon was enraged with the woman and went off to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the witness of Jesus."
Revelation,13,1,"And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore.
T hen I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns were ten diadems, and on his heads were blasphemous names."
Revelation,13,2,"And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority."
Revelation,13,3,"And I saw one of his heads as if it had been slain fatally, and his fatal wound was healed. And the whole earth marveled and followed after the beast."
Revelation,13,4,"And they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who is able to wage war with him?”"
Revelation,13,5,"And there was given to him a mouth speaking great boasts and blasphemies, and authority to act for forty-two months was given to him."
Revelation,13,6,"And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, that is, those who dwell in heaven."
Revelation,13,7,"And it was also given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them, and authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given to him."
Revelation,13,8,"And all who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been slain."
Revelation,13,9,"If anyone has an ear, let him hear."
Revelation,13,10,"If anyone is destined for captivity, to captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he must be killed. Here is the perseverance and the faith of the saints."
Revelation,13,11,"Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and he was speaking as a dragon."
Revelation,13,12,"And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. And he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed."
Revelation,13,13,"And he does great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the presence of men."
Revelation,13,14,"And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which were given to him to do in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who *had the wound of the sword and has come to life."
Revelation,13,15,"And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast would even speak and cause as many as do not worship the image of the beast to be killed."
Revelation,13,16,"And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, that they be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead"
Revelation,13,17,"and that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of his name."
Revelation,13,18,"Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of man; and his number is 666."
Revelation,14,1,"Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with Him 144,000, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads."
Revelation,14,2,"And I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the voice which I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps."
Revelation,14,3,"And they *sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. And no one could learn that song except the 144,000 who had been purchased from the earth."
Revelation,14,4,"These are the ones who are not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb."
Revelation,14,5,And NO LIE WAS FOUND IN THEIR MOUTH; they are blameless.
Revelation,14,6,"Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who inhabit the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people."
Revelation,14,7,"And he said with a loud voice, “Fear God, and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come; worship Him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of waters.”"
Revelation,14,8,"And another angel, a second one, followed, saying, “FALLEN, FALLEN IS BABYLON THE GREAT, she who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality.”"
Revelation,14,9,"Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand"
Revelation,14,10,"and he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength in the cup of His rage, and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb."
Revelation,14,11,"And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.”"
Revelation,14,12,Here is the perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.
Revelation,14,13,"And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, “Write, ‘Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!’ ” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “so that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow with them.”"
Revelation,14,14,"Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud was one like a son of man, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand."
Revelation,14,15,"And another angel came out of the sanctuary, crying out with a loud voice to Him who sits on the cloud, “Put in Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.”"
Revelation,14,16,"Then He who sits on the cloud swung His sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped."
Revelation,14,17,"And another angel came out of the sanctuary which is in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle."
Revelation,14,18,"Then another angel, the one who has authority over fire, came out from the altar; and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, “Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe.”"
Revelation,14,19,"So the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered the clusters from the vine of the earth, and threw them into the great wine press of the wrath of God."
Revelation,14,20,"And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood came out from the wine press, up to the horses’ bridles, for a distance of 1,600 stadia."
Revelation,15,1,"Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels who have seven plagues, which are the last, because in them the wrath of God is finished."
Revelation,15,2,"Then I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who have overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God."
Revelation,15,3,"And they *sang the song of Moses, the slave of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,
“ G REAT AND MARVELOUS ARE YOUR WORKS,
O LORD GOD, THE ALMIGHTY;
RIGHTEOUS AND TRUE ARE YOUR WAYS,
KING OF THE NATIONS!"
Revelation,15,4,"“WHO WILL NOT FEAR, O LORD, AND GLORIFY YOUR NAME?
For You alone are holy;
For ALL THE NATIONS WILL COME AND WORSHIP BEFORE YOU,
FOR YOUR RIGHTEOUS ACTS HAVE BEEN REVEALED.”"
Revelation,15,5,"And after these things I looked, and the sanctuary of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened"
Revelation,15,6,"and the seven angels who have the seven plagues came out of the sanctuary, clothed in linen, clean and bright, and girded around their chests with golden sashes."
Revelation,15,7,"Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever."
Revelation,15,8,And the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one was able to enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.
Revelation,16,1,"Then I heard a loud voice from the sanctuary, saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.”"
Revelation,16,2,So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth; and it became a loathsome and malignant sore on the people who have the mark of the beast and who worship his image.
Revelation,16,3,"And the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man, and every living thing in the sea died."
Revelation,16,4,"Then the third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters, and they became blood."
Revelation,16,5,"And I heard the angel of the waters saying, “Righteous are You, who is and who was, O Holy One, because You judged these things"
Revelation,16,6,"for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink. They deserve it.”"
Revelation,16,7,"And I heard the altar saying, “Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments.”"
Revelation,16,8,"And the fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun, and it was given to it to scorch men with fire."
Revelation,16,9,"And men were scorched with fierce heat, and they blasphemed the name of God who has the authority over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory."
Revelation,16,10,"Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues because of pain"
Revelation,16,11,"and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and they did not repent of their deeds."
Revelation,16,12,"And the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates, and its water was dried up, so that the way would be prepared for the kings from the east."
Revelation,16,13,"Then I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs"
Revelation,16,14,"for they are spirits of demons, doing signs, which go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty."
Revelation,16,15,"(“Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his garments, so that he will not walk about naked and men will not see his shame.”)"
Revelation,16,16,And they gathered them together to the place which in Hebrew is called Har-Magedon.
Revelation,16,17,"Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl upon the air, and a loud voice came out of the sanctuary from the throne, saying, “It is done.”"
Revelation,16,18,"And there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as there had not been since man came to be upon the earth, so great an earthquake was it, and so mighty."
Revelation,16,19,"And the great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the wrath of His rage."
Revelation,16,20,"And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found."
Revelation,16,21,"And huge hailstones, about one talent each, *came down from heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, because its plague *was extremely severe."
Revelation,17,1,"Then one of the seven angels who have the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, “Come here, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters"
Revelation,17,2,"with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality, and those who dwell on the earth were made drunk with the wine of her sexual immorality.”"
Revelation,17,3,"And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness; then I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns."
Revelation,17,4,"And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a gold cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her sexual immorality"
Revelation,17,5,"and on her forehead a name was written, a mystery, “BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.”"
Revelation,17,6,"Then I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered greatly."
Revelation,17,7,"And the angel said to me, “Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns."
Revelation,17,8,"“The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth, whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will wonder when they see the beast, that he was and is not and will come."
Revelation,17,9,Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits
Revelation,17,10,"and they are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while."
Revelation,17,11,"And the beast which was and is not, is himself also an eighth and is one of the seven, and he goes to destruction."
Revelation,17,12,"And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour."
Revelation,17,13,"These have one purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast."
Revelation,17,14,"These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with Him are the called and elect and faithful.”"
Revelation,17,15,"And he *said to me, “The waters which you saw where the harlot sits, are peoples and crowds and nations and tongues."
Revelation,17,16,"And the ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will lay waste to her and make her naked, and will eat her flesh and will burn her up with fire."
Revelation,17,17,"For God gave it in their hearts to do His purpose both by doing their own common purpose and by giving their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God will be finished."
Revelation,17,18,"And the woman whom you saw is the great city, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.”"
Revelation,18,1,"After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illumined with his glory."
Revelation,18,2,"And he cried out with a mighty voice, saying, “FALLEN, FALLEN IS BABYLON THE GREAT! And she has become a dwelling place of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean bird and a prison of every unclean and hateful beast."
Revelation,18,3,"For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the power of her sensuality.”"
Revelation,18,4,"And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, “Come out of her, my people, so that you will not participate in her sins and receive of her plagues"
Revelation,18,5,"for her sins have piled up as high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities."
Revelation,18,6,"Pay her back even as she paid, and give her back double according to her deeds; in the cup which she has mixed, mix double for her."
Revelation,18,7,"To the degree that she glorified herself and lived sensuously, to the same degree give her torment and mourning, for she says in her heart, ‘I SIT as A QUEEN AND I AM NOT A WIDOW, and will never see mourning.’"
Revelation,18,8,"For this reason in one day her plagues will come, pestilence and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire; for the Lord God who judges her is strong."
Revelation,18,9,"“And the kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived sensuously with her, will cry and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning"
Revelation,18,10,"standing at a distance because of the fear of her torment, saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For in one hour your judgment has come.’"
Revelation,18,11,"“And the merchants of the earth cry and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo anymore"
Revelation,18,12,"cargo of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, and every kind of citron wood and every article of ivory and every article made from precious wood and bronze and iron and marble"
Revelation,18,13,"and cinnamon and amomum and incense and perfume and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and cargo of horses and carriages and human beings and human lives."
Revelation,18,14,"And the fruit you long for has gone from you, and all things that were splendid and shining have passed away from you and men will no longer find them."
Revelation,18,15,"The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of the fear of her torment, crying and mourning"
Revelation,18,16,"saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, she who was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls"
Revelation,18,17,"for in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!’ And every shipmaster and every passenger and sailor, and as many as make their living by the sea, stood at a distance"
Revelation,18,18,"and were crying out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, ‘What is like the great city?’"
Revelation,18,19,"And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, crying and mourning, saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who have ships at sea became rich by her wealth, for in one hour she has been laid waste!’"
Revelation,18,20,"Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her.”"
Revelation,18,21,"Then a strong angel picked up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, “So will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence, and will not be found any longer."
Revelation,18,22,And the sound of harpists and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters will not be heard in you any longer; and no craftsman of any craft will be found in you any longer; and the sound of a mill will not be heard in you any longer
Revelation,18,23,"and the light of a lamp will not shine in you any longer; and the voice of the bridegroom and bride will not be heard in you any longer; for your merchants were the great men of the earth, because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery."
Revelation,18,24,And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been slain on the earth.”
Revelation,19,1,"After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great crowd in heaven, saying,
“ H allelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God"
Revelation,19,2,"BECAUSE HIS JUDGMENTS ARE TRUE AND RIGHTEOUS; for He has judged the great harlot who was corrupting the earth with her sexual immorality, and HE HAS AVENGED THE BLOOD OF HIS SLAVES shed BY HER HAND.”"
Revelation,19,3,"And a second time they said, “Hallelujah! HER SMOKE RISES UP FOREVER AND EVER.”"
Revelation,19,4,"And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne saying, “Amen. Hallelujah!”"
Revelation,19,5,"And a voice came from the throne, saying,
“ G ive praise to our God, all you His slaves, you who fear Him, the small and the great.”"
Revelation,19,6,"Then I heard something like the voice of a great crowd and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, saying,
“ H allelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns."
Revelation,19,7,"Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself ready.”"
Revelation,19,8,"And it was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints."
Revelation,19,9,"Then he *said to me, “Write, ‘Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.’ ” And he *said to me, “These are true words of God.”"
Revelation,19,10,"Then I fell at his feet to worship him. But he *said to me, “Do not do that! I am a fellow slave with you and your brothers who have the witness of Jesus. Worship God! For the witness of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”"
Revelation,19,11,"Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and wages war."
Revelation,19,12,"His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems; having a name written on Him which no one knows except Himself"
Revelation,19,13,"and being clothed with a garment dipped in blood, His name is also called The Word of God."
Revelation,19,14,"And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses."
Revelation,19,15,"And from His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may STRIKE DOWN THE NATIONS, and He will RULE THEM WITH A ROD OF IRON; and HE TREADS THE WINE PRESS OF THE WRATH OF THE RAGE OF GOD, the Almighty."
Revelation,19,16,"And He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written, “KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.”"
Revelation,19,17,"Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds which fly in midheaven, “Come, assemble for the great supper of God"
Revelation,19,18,"so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of strong men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free men and slaves, and small and great.”"
Revelation,19,19,Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army.
Revelation,19,20,"And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who did the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone."
Revelation,19,21,"And the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sits on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh."
Revelation,20,1,"Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand."
Revelation,20,2,"And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years"
Revelation,20,3,"and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were finished. After these things he must be released for a short time."
Revelation,20,4,"Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their witness of Jesus and because of the word of God, and who also had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand. And they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years."
Revelation,20,5,The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
Revelation,20,6,"Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection. Over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years."
Revelation,20,7,"And when the thousand years are finished, Satan will be released from his prison"
Revelation,20,8,"and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore."
Revelation,20,9,"And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them."
Revelation,20,10,"And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever."
Revelation,20,11,"Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sits upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them."
Revelation,20,12,"Then I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds."
Revelation,20,13,"And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them, and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds."
Revelation,20,14,"Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire."
Revelation,20,15,"And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire."
Revelation,21,1,"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea."
Revelation,21,2,"And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband."
Revelation,21,3,"And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them"
