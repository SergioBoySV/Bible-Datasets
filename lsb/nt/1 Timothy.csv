1 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus, our hope"
1 Timothy,1,2,"To Timothy, my genuine child in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
1 Timothy,1,3,"As I exhorted you when going to Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus so that you may command certain ones not to teach a different doctrine"
1 Timothy,1,4,"nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the stewardship from God which is by faith."
1 Timothy,1,5,But the goal of our command is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and an unhypocritical faith.
1 Timothy,1,6,"For some, straying from these things, have turned aside to fruitless discussion"
1 Timothy,1,7,"wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions."
1 Timothy,1,8,"But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully"
1 Timothy,1,9,"knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and godless, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers"
1 Timothy,1,10,"for sexually immoral persons, for homosexuals, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching"
1 Timothy,1,11,"according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted."
1 Timothy,1,12,"I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He regarded me faithful, putting me into service"
1 Timothy,1,13,even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor. Yet I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief
1 Timothy,1,14,"and the grace of our Lord was more than abundant, with the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus."
1 Timothy,1,15,"It is a trustworthy saying and deserving full acceptance: that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost."
1 Timothy,1,16,"Yet for this reason I was shown mercy, so that in me as the foremost, Christ Jesus might demonstrate all His patience as an example for those who are going to believe upon Him for eternal life."
1 Timothy,1,17,"Now to the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen."
1 Timothy,1,18,"This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may fight the good fight"
1 Timothy,1,19,"keeping faith and a good conscience, which some, having rejected, suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith."
1 Timothy,1,20,"Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they will be taught not to blaspheme."
1 Timothy,2,1,"First of all, then, I exhort that petitions and prayers, requests and thanksgivings, be made for all men"
1 Timothy,2,2,"for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity."
1 Timothy,2,3,This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior
1 Timothy,2,4,who desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth.
1 Timothy,2,5,"For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus"
1 Timothy,2,6,"who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the witness for this proper time."
1 Timothy,2,7,"For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying) as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth."
1 Timothy,2,8,"Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and dissension."
1 Timothy,2,9,"Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, with modesty and self-restraint, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly clothing"
1 Timothy,2,10,"but rather by means of good works, as is proper for women professing godliness."
1 Timothy,2,11,"A woman must learn in quietness, in all submission."
1 Timothy,2,12,"But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet."
1 Timothy,2,13,"For it was Adam who was first formed, and then Eve."
1 Timothy,2,14,"And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into trespass."
1 Timothy,2,15,"But she will be saved through the bearing of children, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with self-restraint."
1 Timothy,3,1,"It is a trustworthy saying: if any man aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a good work."
1 Timothy,3,2,"An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, respectable, hospitable, able to teach"
1 Timothy,3,3,"not addicted to wine or pugnacious, but considerate, peaceable, free from the love of money"
1 Timothy,3,4,"leading his own household well, having his children in submission with all dignity"
1 Timothy,3,5,"(but if a man does not know how to lead his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?)"
1 Timothy,3,6,"and not a new convert, so that he will not become conceited and fall into the condemnation of the devil."
1 Timothy,3,7,"And he must have a good reputation with those outside the church, so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil."
1 Timothy,3,8,"Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not indulging in much wine, not fond of dishonest gain"
1 Timothy,3,9,but holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
1 Timothy,3,10,And these men must also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach.
1 Timothy,3,11,"Women must likewise be dignified, not malicious gossips, but temperate, faithful in all things."
1 Timothy,3,12,"Deacons must be husbands of only one wife, leading their children and their own households well."
1 Timothy,3,13,For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a high standing and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy,3,14,"I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you soon"
1 Timothy,3,15,"but in case I am delayed, I write so that you will know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth."
1 Timothy,3,16,"And by common confession, great is the mystery of godliness:
He who was manifested in the flesh,
Was vindicated in the Spirit,
Seen by angels,
Proclaimed among the nations,
Believed on in the world,
Taken up in glory."
1 Timothy,4,1,"But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons"
1 Timothy,4,2,"by the hypocrisy of liars, who have been seared in their own conscience"
1 Timothy,4,3,who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God created to be shared in with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
1 Timothy,4,4,"For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving"
1 Timothy,4,5,for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
1 Timothy,4,6,"In pointing out these things to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, being nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound doctrine which you have been following."
1 Timothy,4,7,"But refuse godless myths fit only for old women. On the other hand, train yourself for the purpose of godliness"
1 Timothy,4,8,"for bodily training is only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come."
1 Timothy,4,9,It is a trustworthy saying and deserving full acceptance.
1 Timothy,4,10,"For it is for this we labor and strive, because we have fixed our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of believers."
1 Timothy,4,11,Command and teach these things.
1 Timothy,4,12,"Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but show yourself as a model to those who believe in word, conduct, love, faith, and purity."
1 Timothy,4,13,"Until I come, give attention to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation and teaching."
1 Timothy,4,14,"Do not neglect the gift within you, which was given to you through prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the council of elders."
1 Timothy,4,15,"Take pains with these things; be absorbed in them, so that your progress will be evident to all."
1 Timothy,4,16,"Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching; persevere in these things, for as you do this you will save both yourself and those who hear you."
1 Timothy,5,1,"Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but rather plead with him as a father, to the younger men as brothers"
1 Timothy,5,2,"the older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters, in all purity."
1 Timothy,5,3,Honor widows who are widows indeed
1 Timothy,5,4,"but if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to practice piety in regard to their own family and to make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God."
1 Timothy,5,5,"Now she who is a widow indeed and who has been left alone, has fixed her hope on God and continues in petitions and prayers night and day."
1 Timothy,5,6,But she who lives in self-indulgence is dead even while she lives.
1 Timothy,5,7,"And command these things as well, so that they may be above reproach."
1 Timothy,5,8,"But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."
1 Timothy,5,9,"A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than sixty years old, having been the wife of one man"
1 Timothy,5,10,"having a reputation for good works; if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the saints’ feet, if she has assisted those in affliction, if she has devoted herself to every good work."
1 Timothy,5,11,"But refuse to put younger widows on the list, for when they feel sensual desires in disregard of Christ, they want to get married"
1 Timothy,5,12,"thus incurring condemnation, because they have set aside their previous pledge."
1 Timothy,5,13,"And at the same time they also learn to be idle, as they go around from house to house. And not merely idle, but also gossips and busybodies, talking about things not proper to mention."
1 Timothy,5,14,"Therefore, I want younger widows to get married, bear children, keep house, and give the enemy no opportunity for reviling"
1 Timothy,5,15,for some have already turned aside after Satan.
1 Timothy,5,16,"If any believing woman has widows, she must assist them and the church must not be burdened, so that it may assist those who are widows indeed."
1 Timothy,5,17,"The elders who lead well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor at preaching the word and teaching."
1 Timothy,5,18,"For the Scripture says, “YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE IT IS THRESHING,” and “THE LABORER IS WORTHY OF HIS WAGES.”"
1 Timothy,5,19,Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses.
1 Timothy,5,20,"Those who continue in sin, reprove in the presence of all, so that the rest also will be fearful."
1 Timothy,5,21,"I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of His elect angels, to observe these instructions without bias, doing nothing in partiality."
1 Timothy,5,22,Do not lay hands upon anyone hastily and thereby share responsibility for the sins of others; keep yourself pure.
1 Timothy,5,23,"No longer drink water only, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments."
1 Timothy,5,24,"The sins of some men are quite evident, going before them to judgment; for others, their sins follow after."
1 Timothy,5,25,"So also good works are quite evident, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed."
1 Timothy,6,1,All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine will not be slandered.
1 Timothy,6,2,"But those who have believers as their masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brothers, but must serve them all the more, because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach and exhort these things."
1 Timothy,6,3,If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with sound words—those of our Lord Jesus Christ—and with the doctrine conforming to godliness
1 Timothy,6,4,"he is conceited, understanding nothing but having a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, out of which arise envy, strife, slander, evil suspicions"
1 Timothy,6,5,"and constant friction between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain."
1 Timothy,6,6,"But godliness actually is a means of great gain, when accompanied by contentment."
1 Timothy,6,7,"For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take anything out of it either."
1 Timothy,6,8,"And if we have food and covering, with these we shall be content."
1 Timothy,6,9,But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and destruction.
1 Timothy,6,10,"For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evils, and some by aspiring to it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs."
1 Timothy,6,11,"But you, O man of God, flee from these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, gentleness."
1 Timothy,6,12,"Fight the good fight of faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses."
1 Timothy,6,13,"I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate"
1 Timothy,6,14,that you keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ
1 Timothy,6,15,"which He will bring about at the proper time—He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords"
1 Timothy,6,16,"who alone has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal might! Amen."
1 Timothy,6,17,"Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty or to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy."
1 Timothy,6,18,"Command them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share"
1 Timothy,6,19,"storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed."
1 Timothy,6,20,"O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, turning aside from godless and empty chatter and the opposing arguments of what is falsely called knowledge"
1 Timothy,6,21,"which some, while professing, have gone astray from the faith.
G race be with you."
