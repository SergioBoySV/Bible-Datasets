1 John,1,1,"What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we beheld and touched with our hands, concerning the Word of Life"
1 John,1,2,"and the life was manifested, and we have seen and bear witness and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us"
1 John,1,3,"what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you also, so that you may also have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ."
1 John,1,4,"And these things we are writing, so that our joy may be made complete."
1 John,1,5,"And this is the message we have heard from Him and declare to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all."
1 John,1,6,"If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not do the truth"
1 John,1,7,"but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin."
1 John,1,8,"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."
1 John,1,9,"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
1 John,1,10,"If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us."
1 John,2,1,"My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous"
1 John,2,2,"and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world."
1 John,2,3,"And by this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments."
1 John,2,4,"The one who says, “I have come to know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him"
1 John,2,5,"but whoever keeps His word, truly in him the love of God has been perfected. By this we know that we are in Him"
1 John,2,6,the one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked.
1 John,2,7,"Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you have heard."
1 John,2,8,"On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true Light is already shining."
1 John,2,9,The one who says he is in the Light and yet hates his brother is in the darkness until now.
1 John,2,10,The one who loves his brother abides in the Light and there is no cause for stumbling in him.
1 John,2,11,"But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going because the darkness blinded his eyes."
1 John,2,12,"I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you for His name’s sake."
1 John,2,13,"I am writing to you, fathers, because you have known Him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children, because you have known the Father."
1 John,2,14,"I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one."
1 John,2,15,"Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
1 John,2,16,"For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world."
1 John,2,17,"And the world is passing away, and also its lusts, but the one who does the will of God abides forever."
1 John,2,18,"Children, it is the last hour; and just as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared. From this we know that it is the last hour."
1 John,2,19,"They went out from us, but they were not really of us; for if they were of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out, so that it would be manifested that they all are not of us."
1 John,2,20,"But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know."
1 John,2,21,"I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie is of the truth."
1 John,2,22,"Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son."
1 John,2,23,Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also.
1 John,2,24,"As for you, let that which you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father."
1 John,2,25,And this is the promise which He Himself made to us: eternal life.
1 John,2,26,These things I have written to you about those who are trying to deceive you.
1 John,2,27,"And as for you, the anointing whom you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you. But as His anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as He has taught you, abide in Him."
1 John,2,28,"And now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He is manifested, we may have confidence and not shrink away from Him in shame at His coming."
1 John,2,29,"If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone also who does righteousness has been born of Him."
1 John,3,1,"See how great a love the Father has given to us, that we would be called children of God; and we are. For this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know Him."
1 John,3,2,"Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not been manifested as yet what we will be. We know that when He is manifested, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is."
1 John,3,3,"And everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself, just as He is pure."
1 John,3,4,Everyone who does sin also does lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.
1 John,3,5,"And you know that He was manifested in order to take away sins, and in Him there is no sin."
1 John,3,6,No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or has come to know Him.
1 John,3,7,"Little children, let no one deceive you. The one who does righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous."
1 John,3,8,"The one who does sin is of the devil, because the devil sins from the beginning. The Son of God was manifested for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil."
1 John,3,9,"Everyone who has been born of God does not sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God."
1 John,3,10,"By this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifested: everyone who does not do righteousness is not of God, as well as the one who does not love his brother."
1 John,3,11,"For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another"
1 John,3,12,"not as Cain, who was of the evil one and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother’s were righteous."
1 John,3,13,"Do not marvel, brothers, if the world hates you."
1 John,3,14,"We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. The one who does not love abides in death."
1 John,3,15,"Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him."
1 John,3,16,"By this we have known love, that He laid down His life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers."
1 John,3,17,"But whoever has the world’s goods, and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him?"
1 John,3,18,"Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth."
1 John,3,19,"And by this we will know that we are of the truth, and will assure our heart before Him"
1 John,3,20,in whatever our heart condemns us; for God is greater than our heart and knows all things.
1 John,3,21,"Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God"
1 John,3,22,"and whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight."
1 John,3,23,"And this is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as He gave a commandment to us."
1 John,3,24,"And the one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. We know by this that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave us."
1 John,4,1,"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world."
1 John,4,2,By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God
1 John,4,3,"and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world."
1 John,4,4,"You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world."
1 John,4,5,"They are from the world; therefore they speak as from the world, and the world hears them."
1 John,4,6,We are from God. The one who knows God hears us; the one who is not from God does not hear us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
1 John,4,7,"Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God."
1 John,4,8,"The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love."
1 John,4,9,"By this the love of God was manifested in us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him."
1 John,4,10,"In this is love, not that we have loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins."
1 John,4,11,"Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another."
1 John,4,12,"No one has beheld God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us."
1 John,4,13,"By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit."
1 John,4,14,We have beheld and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.
1 John,4,15,"Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God."
1 John,4,16,"And we have come to know and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him."
1 John,4,17,"By this, love has been perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because as He is, so also are we in this world."
1 John,4,18,"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love."
1 John,4,19,"We love, because He first loved us."
1 John,4,20,"If someone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen."
1 John,4,21,"And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also."
1 John,5,1,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the One who gives new birth loves also the one who has been born of Him."
1 John,5,2,"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do His commandments."
1 John,5,3,"For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome."
1 John,5,4,For everything that has been born of God overcomes the world; and this is the overcoming that has overcome the world—our faith.
1 John,5,5,"Who is the one who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?"
1 John,5,6,"This is the One who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. It is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth."
1 John,5,7,For there are three that bear witness
1 John,5,8,the Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.
1 John,5,9,"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for the witness of God is this, that He has borne witness about His Son."
1 John,5,10,"The one who believes in the Son of God has this witness in himself. The one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the witness which God has borne witness about His Son."
1 John,5,11,"And the witness is this, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in His Son."
1 John,5,12,He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have that life.
1 John,5,13,"These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life."
1 John,5,14,"And this is the confidence which we have before Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us."
1 John,5,15,"And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him."
1 John,5,16,"If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask and God will for him give life to those who commit sin not leading to death. There is a sin leading to death; I do not say that he should make request for this."
1 John,5,17,"All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death."
1 John,5,18,"We know that no one who has been born of God sins; but He who was begotten of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him."
1 John,5,19,"We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one."
1 John,5,20,"And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life."
1 John,5,21,"Little children, guard yourselves from idols."
