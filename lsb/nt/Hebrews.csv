Hebrews,1,1,"God, having spoken long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways"
Hebrews,1,2,"in these last days spoke to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds"
Hebrews,1,3,"who is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power; who, having accomplished cleansing for sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high"
Hebrews,1,4,"having become so much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they."
Hebrews,1,5,"For to which of the angels did He ever say,
“YOU ARE MY SON,
TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU”?
And again,
“I WILL BE A FATHER TO HIM
AND HE SHALL BE A SON TO ME”?"
Hebrews,1,6,"And when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says,
“AND LET ALL THE ANGELS OF GOD WORSHIP HIM.”"
Hebrews,1,7,"And of the angels He says,
“WHO MAKES HIS ANGELS WINDS,
AND HIS MINISTERS FLAMING FIRE.”"
Hebrews,1,8,"But of the Son He says,
“YOUR THRONE, O GOD, IS FOREVER AND EVER,
AND THE SCEPTER OF UPRIGHTNESS IS THE SCEPTER OF YOUR KINGDOM."
Hebrews,1,9,"“YOU HAVE LOVED RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HATED LAWLESSNESS;
THEREFORE GOD, YOUR GOD, HAS ANOINTED YOU
WITH THE OIL OF GLADNESS ABOVE YOUR COMPANIONS.”"
Hebrews,1,10,"And,
“YOU, LORD, IN THE BEGINNING FOUNDED THE EARTH,
AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS"
Hebrews,1,11,"THEY WILL PERISH, BUT YOU REMAIN;
AND THEY ALL WILL WEAR OUT LIKE A GARMENT"
Hebrews,1,12,"AND LIKE A MANTLE YOU WILL ROLL THEM UP;
LIKE A GARMENT THEY WILL ALSO BE CHANGED.
BUT YOU ARE THE SAME,
AND YOUR YEARS WILL NOT COME TO AN END.”"
Hebrews,1,13,"But to which of the angels has He ever said,
“SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND,
UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES
AS A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET”?"
Hebrews,1,14,"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?"
Hebrews,2,1,"For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away."
Hebrews,2,2,"For if the word spoken through angels proved unalterable, and every trespass and disobedience received a just penalty"
Hebrews,2,3,"how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? That salvation, first spoken by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard"
Hebrews,2,4,"God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own will."
Hebrews,2,5,"For He did not subject to angels the world to come, concerning which we are speaking."
Hebrews,2,6,"But one has testified somewhere, saying,
“WHAT IS MAN, THAT YOU REMEMBER HIM?
OR THE SON OF MAN, THAT YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HIM?"
Hebrews,2,7,"“YOU HAVE MADE HIM FOR A LITTLE WHILE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS;
YOU HAVE CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND HONOR,
AND HAVE APPOINTED HIM OVER THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS"
Hebrews,2,8,"YOU HAVE PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET.”
For in subjecting all things to him, He left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him."
Hebrews,2,9,"But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than the angels—Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone."
Hebrews,2,10,"For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings."
Hebrews,2,11,For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brothers
Hebrews,2,12,"saying,
“I WILL RECOUNT YOUR NAME TO MY BROTHERS,
IN THE MIDST OF THE ASSEMBLY I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE.”"
Hebrews,2,13,"And again,
“I WILL PUT MY TRUST IN HIM.”
And again,
“BEHOLD, I AND THE CHILDREN WHOM GOD HAS GIVEN ME.”"
Hebrews,2,14,"Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil"
Hebrews,2,15,and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.
Hebrews,2,16,"For assuredly He does not give help to angels, but He gives help to the seed of Abraham."
Hebrews,2,17,"Therefore, He had to be made like His brothers in all things, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people."
Hebrews,2,18,"For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has suffered, He is able to come to help those who are tempted."
Hebrews,3,1,"Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession—Jesus"
Hebrews,3,2,"who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house."
Hebrews,3,3,"For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, in so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house."
Hebrews,3,4,"For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God."
Hebrews,3,5,"Now MOSES WAS FAITHFUL IN ALL HIS HOUSE AS A SERVANT, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later"
Hebrews,3,6,"but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house—whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope."
Hebrews,3,7,"Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says,
“TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE"
Hebrews,3,8,"DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME,
AS IN THE DAY OF TRIAL IN THE WILDERNESS"
Hebrews,3,9,"WHERE YOUR FATHERS TRIED Me BY TESTING Me,
AND SAW MY WORKS FOR FORTY YEARS."
Hebrews,3,10,"“THEREFORE I WAS ANGRY WITH THIS GENERATION,
AND SAID, ‘THEY ALWAYS GO ASTRAY IN THEIR HEART,
AND THEY DID NOT KNOW MY WAYS’"
Hebrews,3,11,"AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH,
‘THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.’ ”"
Hebrews,3,12,"See to it brothers, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God."
Hebrews,3,13,"But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called “TODAY,” so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."
Hebrews,3,14,"For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end"
Hebrews,3,15,"while it is said,
“TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE,
DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS, AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME.”"
Hebrews,3,16,"For who provoked Him when they had heard? Indeed, did not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?"
Hebrews,3,17,"And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness?"
Hebrews,3,18,"And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who were disobedient?"
Hebrews,3,19,So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.
Hebrews,4,1,"Therefore, let us fear, lest, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have fallen short of it."
Hebrews,4,2,"For indeed we have had good news proclaimed to us, just as they also; but the word that was heard did not profit those who were not united with faith among those who heard."
Hebrews,4,3,"For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said,
“AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH,
THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST,”
although His works were finished from the foundation of the world."
Hebrews,4,4,For He has spoken somewhere in this way concerning the seventh day: “AND GOD RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY FROM ALL HIS WORKS”
Hebrews,4,5,"and again in this passage, “THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.”"
Hebrews,4,6,"Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had good news proclaimed to them failed to enter because of disobedience"
Hebrews,4,7,"He again determines a certain day, “TODAY,” saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before,
“TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE,
DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS.”"
Hebrews,4,8,"For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that."
Hebrews,4,9,So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
Hebrews,4,10,"For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His."
Hebrews,4,11,"Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall into the same example of disobedience."
Hebrews,4,12,"For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart."
Hebrews,4,13,"And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are uncovered and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we have an account to give."
Hebrews,4,14,"Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us take hold of our confession."
Hebrews,4,15,"For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things like we are, yet without sin."
Hebrews,4,16,"Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
Hebrews,5,1,"For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins"
Hebrews,5,2,"being able to deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since he himself also is beset with weakness"
Hebrews,5,3,"and because of it, he is obligated, just as for the people, to also offer sacrifices for sins in the same way for himself."
Hebrews,5,4,"And no one takes this honor to himself, but receives it when he is called by God, even as Aaron was."
Hebrews,5,5,"In this way also Christ did not glorify Himself to become a high priest, but He who said to Him,
“YOU ARE MY SON,
TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU”"
Hebrews,5,6,"just as He says also in another passage,
“YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER
ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK.”"
Hebrews,5,7,"He, in the days of His flesh, offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His reverence."
Hebrews,5,8,"Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things which He suffered."
Hebrews,5,9,"And having been made perfect, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation"
Hebrews,5,10,being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews,5,11,"Concerning him we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing."
Hebrews,5,12,"For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food."
Hebrews,5,13,"For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness, for he is an infant."
Hebrews,5,14,"But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern both good and evil."
Hebrews,6,1,"Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God"
Hebrews,6,2,"of teaching about washings and laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment."
Hebrews,6,3,"And this we will do, if God permits."
Hebrews,6,4,For in the case of those once having been enlightened and having tasted of the heavenly gift and having become partakers of the Holy Spirit
Hebrews,6,5,and having tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come
Hebrews,6,6,"and having fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame."
Hebrews,6,7,"For ground that drinks the rain which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God"
Hebrews,6,8,"but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is unfit and close to being cursed, and its end is to be burned."
Hebrews,6,9,"But we are convinced about you, beloved, of things that are better and that belong to salvation, though we are speaking in this way."
Hebrews,6,10,"For God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and continuing to minister to the saints."
Hebrews,6,11,And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end
Hebrews,6,12,"so that you may not become dull, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
Hebrews,6,13,"For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself"
Hebrews,6,14,"saying, “I WILL GREATLY BLESS YOU AND I WILL GREATLY MULTIPLY YOU.”"
Hebrews,6,15,"And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise."
Hebrews,6,16,"For men swear by one greater than themselves, and with them an oath given as confirmation is an end of every dispute."
Hebrews,6,17,"In the same way God, desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose, guaranteed it with an oath"
Hebrews,6,18,"so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us."
Hebrews,6,19,"This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and confirmed and one which enters within the veil"
Hebrews,6,20,"where a forerunner has entered for us—Jesus, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."
Hebrews,7,1,"For this MELCHIZEDEK, KING OF SALEM, PRIEST OF THE MOST HIGH GOD, who met ABRAHAM AS HE WAS RETURNING FROM THE SLAUGHTER OF THE KINGS and BLESSED HIM"
Hebrews,7,2,"TO WHOM ALSO ABRAHAM APPORTIONED A TENTH PART OF ALL, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace."
Hebrews,7,3,"Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest continually."
Hebrews,7,4,"Now observe how great this man was TO WHOM ABRAHAM, the patriarch, GAVE A TENTH of the spoils."
Hebrews,7,5,"And those indeed of the sons of Levi, who receive the priest’s office, have a commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brothers, although these are descended from Abraham."
Hebrews,7,6,But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them had collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.
Hebrews,7,7,But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.
Hebrews,7,8,"And in this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on."
Hebrews,7,9,"And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes"
Hebrews,7,10,for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
Hebrews,7,11,"Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron?"
Hebrews,7,12,"For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also."
Hebrews,7,13,"For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar."
Hebrews,7,14,"For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests."
Hebrews,7,15,"And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek"
Hebrews,7,16,"who has become such not according to a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life."
Hebrews,7,17,"For it is witnessed about Him,
“YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER
ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK.”"
Hebrews,7,18,"For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness"
Hebrews,7,19,"(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God."
Hebrews,7,20,And inasmuch as it was not without an oath
Hebrews,7,21,"(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him,
“THE LORD HAS SWORN
AND WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND,
‘YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER’ ”)"
Hebrews,7,22,so much more Jesus also has become the guarantee of a better covenant.
Hebrews,7,23,"And the former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing"
Hebrews,7,24,"but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently."
Hebrews,7,25,"Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them."
Hebrews,7,26,"For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens"
Hebrews,7,27,"who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself."
Hebrews,7,28,"For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, who has been made perfect forever."
Hebrews,8,1,"Now the main point in what is being said is this: we have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens"
Hebrews,8,2,"a minister in the holy places and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man."
Hebrews,8,3,For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.
Hebrews,8,4,"Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law"
Hebrews,8,5,"who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, “SEE,” He says, “THAT YOU MAKE all things ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN WHICH WAS SHOWN YOU ON THE MOUNTAIN.”"
Hebrews,8,6,"But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises."
Hebrews,8,7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion sought for a second."
Hebrews,8,8,"For finding fault with them, He says,
“BEHOLD, DAYS ARE COMING, SAYS THE LORD,
WHEN I WILL COMPLETE A NEW COVENANT
WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND WITH THE HOUSE OF JUDAH"
Hebrews,8,9,"NOT LIKE THE COVENANT WHICH I MADE WITH THEIR FATHERS
IN THE DAY WHEN I TOOK THEM BY THE HAND
TO LEAD THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT;
FOR THEY DID NOT CONTINUE IN MY COVENANT,
AND I DID NOT CARE FOR THEM, SAYS THE LORD."
Hebrews,8,10,"“FOR THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL
AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD:
I WILL PUT MY LAWS INTO THEIR MINDS,
AND UPON THEIR HEARTS I WILL WRITE THEM.
AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD,
AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE."
Hebrews,8,11,"“AND THEY SHALL NOT TEACH EVERYONE HIS FELLOW CITIZEN,
AND EVERYONE HIS BROTHER, SAYING, ‘KNOW THE LORD,’
FOR ALL WILL KNOW ME,
FROM THE LEAST TO THE GREATEST OF THEM."
Hebrews,8,12,"“FOR I WILL BE MERCIFUL TO THEIR INIQUITIES,
AND I WILL REMEMBER THEIR SINS NO MORE.”"
Hebrews,8,13,"When He said, “A new covenant,” He has made the first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to disappear."
Hebrews,9,1,Now even the first covenant had requirements of divine worship and the earthly sanctuary.
Hebrews,9,2,"For there was a tabernacle prepared: the first part, in which were the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread, which is called the holy place."
Hebrews,9,3,And behind the second veil there was a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies
Hebrews,9,4,"having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron’s rod which budded, and the tablets of the covenant."
Hebrews,9,5,And above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.
Hebrews,9,6,"Now when these things have been so prepared, the priests are continually entering the first part of the tabernacle performing the divine worship"
Hebrews,9,7,"but into the second, only the high priest enters once a year, not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance."
Hebrews,9,8,"The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into the holy places has not yet been manifested while that first part of the tabernacle is still standing"
Hebrews,9,9,which is a symbol for the present time. Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make the worshiper perfect in conscience
Hebrews,9,10,"since they relate only to food and drink and various washings, requirements for the body imposed until a time of reformation."
Hebrews,9,11,"But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation"
Hebrews,9,12,"and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy places once for all, having obtained eternal redemption."
Hebrews,9,13,For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh
Hebrews,9,14,"how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
Hebrews,9,15,"And for this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the trespasses that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance."
Hebrews,9,16,"For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it."
Hebrews,9,17,"For a covenant is valid only when men are dead, for it is never in force while the one who made it lives."
Hebrews,9,18,Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood.
Hebrews,9,19,"For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people"
Hebrews,9,20,"saying, “THIS IS THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT WHICH GOD COMMANDED YOU.”"
Hebrews,9,21,"And in the same way, both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled with the blood."
Hebrews,9,22,"And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness."
Hebrews,9,23,"Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."
Hebrews,9,24,"For Christ did not enter holy places made with hands, mere copies of the true ones, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us"
Hebrews,9,25,"nor was it that He would offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the holy places year by year with blood that is not his own."
Hebrews,9,26,"Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself."
Hebrews,9,27,And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment
Hebrews,9,28,"so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to those who eagerly await Him."
Hebrews,10,1,"For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually year by year, make perfect those who draw near."
Hebrews,10,2,"Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have consciousness of sins?"
Hebrews,10,3,But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year by year.
Hebrews,10,4,For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
Hebrews,10,5,"Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says,
“SACRIFICE AND OFFERING YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED,
BUT A BODY YOU HAVE PREPARED FOR ME"
Hebrews,10,6,IN BURNT OFFERINGS AND sacrifices FOR SIN YOU HAVE TAKEN NO PLEASURE.
Hebrews,10,7,"“THEN I SAID, ‘BEHOLD, I HAVE COME,
IN THE SCROLL OF THE BOOK IT IS WRITTEN OF ME,
TO DO YOUR WILL, O GOD.’ ”"
Hebrews,10,8,"After saying above, “SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS AND BURNT OFFERINGS AND sacrifices FOR SIN YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, NOR HAVE YOU TAKEN PLEASURE in them” (which are offered according to the Law)"
Hebrews,10,9,"then He said, “BEHOLD, I HAVE COME TO DO YOUR WILL.” He takes away the first in order to establish the second."
Hebrews,10,10,By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
Hebrews,10,11,"And every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins"
Hebrews,10,12,"but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD"
Hebrews,10,13,waiting from that time UNTIL HIS ENEMIES ARE PUT AS A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET.
Hebrews,10,14,For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.
Hebrews,10,15,"And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying"
Hebrews,10,16,"“THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THEM
AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD:
I WILL PUT MY LAWS UPON THEIR HEART,
AND ON THEIR MIND I WILL WRITE THEM,”
He then says"
Hebrews,10,17,"“AND THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS
I WILL REMEMBER NO MORE.”"
Hebrews,10,18,"Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering for sin."
Hebrews,10,19,"Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus"
Hebrews,10,20,"by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh"
Hebrews,10,21,and since we have a great priest over the house of God
Hebrews,10,22,"let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water."
Hebrews,10,23,"Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful."
Hebrews,10,24,And let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds
Hebrews,10,25,"not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the day drawing near."
Hebrews,10,26,"For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins"
Hebrews,10,27,but a terrifying expectation of judgment and THE FURY OF A FIRE WHICH WILL CONSUME THE ADVERSARIES.
Hebrews,10,28,Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy by the mouth of two or three witnesses.
Hebrews,10,29,"How much worse punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has regarded as defiled the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?"
Hebrews,10,30,"For we know Him who said, “VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY.” And again, “THE LORD WILL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE.”"
Hebrews,10,31,It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews,10,32,"But remember the former days, when, after being enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings"
Hebrews,10,33,"partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and afflictions, and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated."
Hebrews,10,34,"For you also showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted with joy the seizure of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better and lasting possession."
Hebrews,10,35,"Therefore, do not throw away that confidence of yours, which has a great reward."
Hebrews,10,36,"For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise."
Hebrews,10,37,"FOR YET IN A VERY LITTLE WHILE,
HE WHO IS COMING WILL COME, AND WILL NOT DELAY."
Hebrews,10,38,"BUT MY RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL LIVE BY FAITH,
AND IF HE SHRINKS BACK, MY SOUL HAS NO PLEASURE IN HIM."
Hebrews,10,39,"But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the preserving of the soul."
Hebrews,11,1,"Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen."
Hebrews,11,2,For by it the men of old gained approval.
Hebrews,11,3,"By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible."
Hebrews,11,4,"By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he was approved as being righteous—God approving his gifts—and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks."
Hebrews,11,5,"By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; AND HE WAS NOT FOUND BECAUSE GOD TOOK HIM UP; for prior to being taken up, he was approved as being pleasing to God."
Hebrews,11,6,"And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who draws near to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him."
Hebrews,11,7,"By faith Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith."
Hebrews,11,8,"By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going."
Hebrews,11,9,"By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise"
