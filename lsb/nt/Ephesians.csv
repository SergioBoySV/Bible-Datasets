Ephesians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
T o the saints who are at Ephesus and who are faithful in Christ Jesus"
Ephesians,1,2,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ"
Ephesians,1,4,"just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him in love"
Ephesians,1,5,"by predestining us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will"
Ephesians,1,6,"to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He graciously bestowed on us in the Beloved."
Ephesians,1,7,"In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our transgressions, according to the riches of His grace"
Ephesians,1,8,which He caused to abound to us in all wisdom and insight
Ephesians,1,9,"making known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Him"
Ephesians,1,10,"for an administration of the fullness of the times, that is, the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth in Him."
Ephesians,1,11,"In Him, we also have been made an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will"
Ephesians,1,12,to the end that we who first have hoped in Christ would be to the praise of His glory.
Ephesians,1,13,"In Him, you also, after listening to the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise"
Ephesians,1,14,"who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, unto the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of His glory."
Ephesians,1,15,"For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which exists among you and your love for all the saints"
Ephesians,1,16,"do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention of you in my prayers"
Ephesians,1,17,"that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the full knowledge of Him"
Ephesians,1,18,"so that you—the eyes of your heart having been enlightened—will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints"
Ephesians,1,19,and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe according to the working of the might of His strength
Ephesians,1,20,"which He worked in Christ, by raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenly places"
Ephesians,1,21,"far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come."
Ephesians,1,22,"And HE PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET, and gave Him as head over all things to the church"
Ephesians,1,23,"which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all."
Ephesians,2,1,And you were dead in your transgressions and sins
Ephesians,2,2,"in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience"
Ephesians,2,3,"among whom we all also formerly conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest."
Ephesians,2,4,"But God, being rich in mercy because of His great love with which He loved us"
Ephesians,2,5,"even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved"
Ephesians,2,6,"and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus"
Ephesians,2,7,so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
Ephesians,2,8,"For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves, it is the gift of God"
Ephesians,2,9,"not of works, so that no one may boast."
Ephesians,2,10,"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."
Ephesians,2,11,"Therefore, remember that formerly you—the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called “Uncircumcision” by the so-called “Circumcision,” which is performed in the flesh by human hands"
Ephesians,2,12,"remember that you were at that time without Christ, alienated from the citizenship of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world."
Ephesians,2,13,But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
Ephesians,2,14,"For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups one and broke down the dividing wall of the partition"
Ephesians,2,15,"by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might create the two into one new man, making peace"
Ephesians,2,16,"and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having in Himself put to death the enmity."
Ephesians,2,17,"AND HE CAME AND PREACHED THE GOOD NEWS OF PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR AWAY, AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR"
Ephesians,2,18,for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.
Ephesians,2,19,"So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household"
Ephesians,2,20,"having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone"
Ephesians,2,21,"in whom the whole building, being joined together, is growing into a holy sanctuary in the Lord"
Ephesians,2,22,in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.
Ephesians,3,1,"For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles"
Ephesians,3,2,if indeed you heard of the stewardship of God’s grace which was given to me for you
Ephesians,3,3,"that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief."
Ephesians,3,4,"About which, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ"
Ephesians,3,5,"which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it was now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit"
Ephesians,3,6,"that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel"
Ephesians,3,7,"of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God’s grace which was given to me according to the working of His power."
Ephesians,3,8,"To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to proclaim to the Gentiles the good news of the unfathomable riches of Christ"
Ephesians,3,9,and to bring to light for all what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things
Ephesians,3,10,so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.
Ephesians,3,11,This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord
Ephesians,3,12,in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him.
Ephesians,3,13,"Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my afflictions on your behalf, which are your glory."
Ephesians,3,14,For this reason I bow my knees before the Father
Ephesians,3,15,from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named
Ephesians,3,16,"that He would give you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man"
Ephesians,3,17,"so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being firmly rooted and grounded in love"
Ephesians,3,18,may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth
Ephesians,3,19,"and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God."
Ephesians,3,20,"Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or understand, according to the power that works within us"
Ephesians,3,21,to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.
Ephesians,4,1,"Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord, exhort you to walk worthy of the calling with which you have been called"
Ephesians,4,2,"with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love"
Ephesians,4,3,being diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
Ephesians,4,4,"There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling"
Ephesians,4,5,"one Lord, one faith, one baptism"
Ephesians,4,6,one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.
Ephesians,4,7,But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s gift.
Ephesians,4,8,"Therefore it says,
“WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH,
HE LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES,
And HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN.”"
Ephesians,4,9,"(Now this expression, “He ascended,” what does it mean except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth?"
Ephesians,4,10,"He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.)"
Ephesians,4,11,"And He Himself gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers"
Ephesians,4,12,"for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ"
Ephesians,4,13,"until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ"
Ephesians,4,14,"so that we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming"
Ephesians,4,15,"but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, that is Christ"
Ephesians,4,16,"from whom the whole body, being joined and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the properly measured working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love."
Ephesians,4,17,"Therefore this I say, and testify in the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind"
Ephesians,4,18,"being darkened in their mind, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart."
Ephesians,4,19,"And they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness."
Ephesians,4,20,But you did not learn Christ in this way
Ephesians,4,21,"if indeed you heard Him and were taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus"
Ephesians,4,22,"to lay aside, in reference to your former conduct, the old man, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit"
Ephesians,4,23,and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind
Ephesians,4,24,"and to put on the new man, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth."
Ephesians,4,25,"Therefore, laying aside falsehood, SPEAK TRUTH EACH ONE of you WITH HIS NEIGHBOR, for we are members of one another."
Ephesians,4,26,"BE ANGRY, AND yet DO NOT SIN; do not let the sun go down on your anger"
Ephesians,4,27,and do not give the devil an opportunity.
Ephesians,4,28,"He who steals must steal no longer, but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with one who has need."
Ephesians,4,29,"Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for building up what is needed, so that it will give grace to those who hear."
Ephesians,4,30,"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."
Ephesians,4,31,"Let all bitterness and anger and wrath and shouting and slander be put away from you, along with all malice."
Ephesians,4,32,"Instead, be kind to one another, tender-hearted, graciously forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has graciously forgiven you."
Ephesians,5,1,"Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children"
Ephesians,5,2,"and walk in love, just as Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma."
Ephesians,5,3,"But sexual immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints"
Ephesians,5,4,"nor filthiness and foolish talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks."
Ephesians,5,5,"For this you know with certainty, that no one sexually immoral or impure or greedy, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God."
Ephesians,5,6,"Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience."
Ephesians,5,7,Therefore do not be partakers with them
Ephesians,5,8,"for you were formerly darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of light"
Ephesians,5,9,(for the fruit of that light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth)
Ephesians,5,10,trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.
Ephesians,5,11,"And do not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead even expose them."
Ephesians,5,12,For it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.
Ephesians,5,13,"But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light."
Ephesians,5,14,"For this reason it says,
“Awake, sleeper,
And arise from the dead,
And Christ will shine on you.”"
Ephesians,5,15,"Therefore look carefully how you walk, not as unwise but as wise"
Ephesians,5,16,"redeeming the time, because the days are evil."
Ephesians,5,17,"On account of this, do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is."
Ephesians,5,18,"And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit"
Ephesians,5,19,"speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord"
Ephesians,5,20,"always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father"
Ephesians,5,21,and being subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
Ephesians,5,22,"Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord."
Ephesians,5,23,"For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body."
Ephesians,5,24,"But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything."
Ephesians,5,25,"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her"
Ephesians,5,26,"so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word"
Ephesians,5,27,"that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she would be holy and blameless."
Ephesians,5,28,So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself
Ephesians,5,29,"for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church"
Ephesians,5,30,because we are members of His body.
Ephesians,5,31,"FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH."
Ephesians,5,32,"This mystery is great, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church."
Ephesians,5,33,"Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband."
Ephesians,6,1,"Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right."
Ephesians,6,2,HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER (which is the first commandment with a promise)
Ephesians,6,3,"SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU, AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG IN THE LAND."
Ephesians,6,4,"Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."
Ephesians,6,5,"Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the integrity of your heart, as to Christ"
Ephesians,6,6,"not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart"
Ephesians,6,7,"serving with good will as to the Lord, and not to men"
Ephesians,6,8,"knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free."
Ephesians,6,9,"And masters, do the same things to them, giving up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him."
Ephesians,6,10,"Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the might of His strength."
Ephesians,6,11,"Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil."
Ephesians,6,12,"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places."
Ephesians,6,13,"Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm."
Ephesians,6,14,"Stand firm therefore, HAVING GIRDED YOUR LOINS WITH TRUTH, and HAVING PUT ON THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS"
Ephesians,6,15,and having shod YOUR FEET WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE.
Ephesians,6,16,"In addition to all, having taken up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one"
Ephesians,6,17,"also receive THE HELMET OF SALVATION, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God"
Ephesians,6,18,"praying at all times with all prayer and petition in the Spirit, and to this end, being on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints"
Ephesians,6,19,"as well as on my behalf, that words may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel"
Ephesians,6,20,"for which I am an ambassador in chains—so that in proclaiming it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak."
Ephesians,6,21,"But that you also may know about all my affairs, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will make everything known to you."
Ephesians,6,22,"I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know our circumstances, and that he may encourage your hearts."
Ephesians,6,23,"Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
Ephesians,6,24,Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love.
