2 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus"
2 Timothy,1,2,"To Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
2 Timothy,1,3,"I am grateful to God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did, as I unceasingly remember you in my prayers night and day"
2 Timothy,1,4,"longing to see you, having remembered your tears, so that I may be filled with joy"
2 Timothy,1,5,"being reminded of the unhypocritical faith within you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am convinced that it is in you as well."
2 Timothy,1,6,For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
2 Timothy,1,7,"For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and self-discipline."
2 Timothy,1,8,"Therefore do not be ashamed of either the witness about our Lord or me His prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God"
2 Timothy,1,9,"who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus from all eternity"
2 Timothy,1,10,"but now has been manifested by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel"
2 Timothy,1,11,for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher.
2 Timothy,1,12,"For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day."
2 Timothy,1,13,"Hold to the standard of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,1,14,"Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you."
2 Timothy,1,15,"You are aware of this: that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes."
2 Timothy,1,16,"The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains"
2 Timothy,1,17,"but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me"
2 Timothy,1,18,the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day—and you know very well what services he rendered at Ephesus.
2 Timothy,2,1,"You therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,2,2,"And the things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also."
2 Timothy,2,3,"Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,2,4,"No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier."
2 Timothy,2,5,"And also if anyone competes as an athlete, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules."

2 Timothy,2,7,"Understand what I say, for the Lord will give you insight in everything."
2 Timothy,2,8,"Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel"
2 Timothy,2,9,for which I endure hardship even to chains as a criminal. But the word of God has not been chained.
2 Timothy,2,10,"For this reason I endure all things for the sake of the elect, so that they also may obtain the salvation, which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory."
2 Timothy,2,11,"It is a trustworthy saying:
For if we died with Him, we will also live with Him"
2 Timothy,2,12,"If we endure, we will also reign with Him;
If we will deny Him, He also will deny us"
2 Timothy,2,13,"If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself."
2 Timothy,2,14,"Remind them of these things, solemnly charging them in the presence of God not to dispute about words, which is useless and leads to the ruin of the hearers."
2 Timothy,2,15,"Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth."
2 Timothy,2,16,"But avoid godless and empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness"
2 Timothy,2,17,and their word will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus
2 Timothy,2,18,"who have gone astray from the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some."
2 Timothy,2,19,"Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, “THE LORD KNOWS THOSE WHO ARE HIS,” and, “EVERYONE WHO NAMES THE NAME OF THE LORD is to DEPART FROM WICKEDNESS.”"
2 Timothy,2,20,"Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of clay, and some to honor and some to dishonor."
2 Timothy,2,21,"Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, having been prepared for every good work."
2 Timothy,2,22,"Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart."
2 Timothy,2,23,"But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce quarrels."
2 Timothy,2,24,"And the Lord’s slave must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged"
2 Timothy,2,25,"with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may give them repentance leading to the full knowledge of the truth"
2 Timothy,2,26,"and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will."
2 Timothy,3,1,"But know this, that in the last days difficult times will come."
2 Timothy,3,2,"For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy"
2 Timothy,3,3,"unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, without gentleness, without love for good"
2 Timothy,3,4,"treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God"
2 Timothy,3,5,"holding to a form of godliness, but having denied its power. Keep away from such men as these."
2 Timothy,3,6,"For among them are those who enter into households and take captive weak women weighed down with sins, being led on by various desires"
2 Timothy,3,7,always learning and never able to come to the full knowledge of the truth.
2 Timothy,3,8,"Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, disqualified in regard to the faith."
2 Timothy,3,9,"But they will not make further progress, for their folly will be obvious to all, just as theirs was also."
2 Timothy,3,10,"But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance"
2 Timothy,3,11,"persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra. What persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me!"
2 Timothy,3,12,"Indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted."
2 Timothy,3,13,"But evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived."
2 Timothy,3,14,"But you, continue in the things you learned and became convinced of, knowing from whom you learned them"
2 Timothy,3,15,and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy,3,16,"All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness"
2 Timothy,3,17,"so that the man of God may be equipped, having been thoroughly equipped for every good work."
2 Timothy,4,1,"I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom"
2 Timothy,4,2,"preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and teaching."
2 Timothy,4,3,"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires"
2 Timothy,4,4,and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.
2 Timothy,4,5,"But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry."
2 Timothy,4,6,"For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come."
2 Timothy,4,7,"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith."
2 Timothy,4,8,"In the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing."
2 Timothy,4,9,Be diligent to come to me soon
2 Timothy,4,10,"for Demas, having loved this present age, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia."
2 Timothy,4,11,"Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service."
2 Timothy,4,12,But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.
2 Timothy,4,13,"When you come bring the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the scrolls, especially the parchments."
2 Timothy,4,14,Alexander the coppersmith showed me much harm; the Lord will award him according to his deeds.
2 Timothy,4,15,"Be on guard against him yourself, for he vigorously opposed our words."
2 Timothy,4,16,"At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me. May it not be counted against them."
2 Timothy,4,17,"But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that through me the preaching might be fulfilled, and that all the Gentiles might hear. And I was rescued out of the lion’s mouth."
2 Timothy,4,18,"The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will save me unto His heavenly kingdom; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen."
2 Timothy,4,19,"Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus."
2 Timothy,4,20,"Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus."
2 Timothy,4,21,"Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, also Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers."
2 Timothy,4,22,The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with all of you.
