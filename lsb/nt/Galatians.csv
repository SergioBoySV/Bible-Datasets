Galatians,1,1,"Paul, an apostle—not sent from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead"
Galatians,1,2,"and all the brothers who are with me,
T o the churches of Galatia"
Galatians,1,3,Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
Galatians,1,4,"who gave Himself for our sins so that He might rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father"
Galatians,1,5,to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Galatians,1,6,I marvel that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ for a different gospel
Galatians,1,7,"which is really not another, only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ."
Galatians,1,8,"But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should proclaim to you a gospel contrary to the gospel we have proclaimed to you, let him be accursed!"
Galatians,1,9,"As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is proclaiming to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be accursed!"
Galatians,1,10,"For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a slave of Christ."
Galatians,1,11,"For I make known to you, brothers, that the gospel which I am proclaiming as good news is not according to man."
Galatians,1,12,"For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ."
Galatians,1,13,"For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it."
Galatians,1,14,"And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my countrymen, being far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers."
Galatians,1,15,"But when God, who had set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me through His grace, was pleased"
Galatians,1,16,"to reveal His Son in me so that I might proclaim Him as good news among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood"
Galatians,1,17,"nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus."
Galatians,1,18,"Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and stayed with him fifteen days."
Galatians,1,19,"But I did not see any other of the apostles except James, the Lord’s brother."
Galatians,1,20,"(Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I am not lying!)"
Galatians,1,21,Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
Galatians,1,22,And I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which are in Christ
Galatians,1,23,"but only, they kept hearing, “He who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the good news of the faith which he once tried to destroy.”"
Galatians,1,24,And they were glorifying God because of me.
Galatians,2,1,"Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also."
Galatians,2,2,"And I went up because of a revelation, and I laid out to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but I did so in private to those who were of reputation, lest somehow I might be running, or had run, in vain."
Galatians,2,3,"But not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised."
Galatians,2,4,"But this was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who had sneaked in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to enslave us."
Galatians,2,5,"But we did not yield in subjection to them for even a moment, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you."
Galatians,2,6,"But from those who were of high reputation (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)—well, those who were of reputation contributed nothing to me."
Galatians,2,7,"But on the contrary, seeing that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised"
Galatians,2,8,(for He who worked in Peter unto his apostleship to the circumcised worked in me also unto the Gentiles)
Galatians,2,9,"and recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we might go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised."
Galatians,2,10,Only they asked us to remember the poor—the very thing I also was eager to do.
Galatians,2,11,"But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned."
Galatians,2,12,"For prior to the coming of certain men from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles, but when they came, he began to shrink back and separate himself, fearing the party of the circumcision."
Galatians,2,13,"And the rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy."
Galatians,2,14,"But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before everyone, “If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?"
Galatians,2,15,“We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles
Galatians,2,16,"nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified."
Galatians,2,17,"But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have also been found sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? May it never be!"
Galatians,2,18,"For if I rebuild what I have once destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor."
Galatians,2,19,"For through the Law I died to the Law, so that I might live to God."
Galatians,2,20,"I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me."
Galatians,2,21,"I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died needlessly.”"
Galatians,3,1,"O foolish Galatians, who bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?"
Galatians,3,2,"This is the only thing I want to learn from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?"
Galatians,3,3,"Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?"
Galatians,3,4,Did you suffer so many things for nothing—if indeed it was for nothing?
Galatians,3,5,"So then, does He who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you, do it by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?"
Galatians,3,6,Just as Abraham BELIEVED GOD AND IT WAS COUNTED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS
Galatians,3,7,"so know that those who are of faith, those are sons of Abraham."
Galatians,3,8,"And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “ALL THE NATIONS WILL BE BLESSED IN YOU.”"
Galatians,3,9,"So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer."
Galatians,3,10,"For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse, for it is written, “CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT ABIDE BY ALL THINGS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW, TO DO THEM.”"
Galatians,3,11,"Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident, for “THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.”"
Galatians,3,12,"However, the Law is not of faith; rather, “HE WHO DOES THEM SHALL LIVE BY THEM.”"
Galatians,3,13,"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us—for it is written, “CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON A TREE”"
Galatians,3,14,"in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."
Galatians,3,15,"Brothers, I speak in human terms: even though it is only a man’s covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside or adds conditions to it."
Galatians,3,16,"Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, “And to seeds,” as referring to many, but rather to one, “And TO YOUR SEED,” that is, Christ."
Galatians,3,17,"And what I am saying is this: the Law, which came 430 years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to abolish the promise."
Galatians,3,18,"For if the inheritance is by law, it is no longer by promise, but God has granted it to Abraham through promise."
Galatians,3,19,"Why the Law then? It was added because of trespasses, having been ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator, until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made."
Galatians,3,20,"Now a mediator is not for one person only, whereas God is one."
Galatians,3,21,"Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given which was able to impart life, then righteousness would indeed be by law."
Galatians,3,22,"But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe."
Galatians,3,23,"But before faith came, we were held in custody under the Law, being shut up for the coming faith to be revealed."
Galatians,3,24,"Therefore the Law has become our tutor unto Christ, so that we may be justified by faith."
Galatians,3,25,"But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor."
Galatians,3,26,For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
Galatians,3,27,For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
Galatians,3,28,"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
Galatians,3,29,"And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise."
Galatians,4,1,"Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he does not differ at all from a slave although he is owner of everything"
Galatians,4,2,but he is under guardians and stewards until the date set by the father.
Galatians,4,3,"So also we, while we were children, were enslaved under the elemental things of the world."
Galatians,4,4,"But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law"
Galatians,4,5,"so that He might redeem those who were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons."
Galatians,4,6,"And because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!”"
Galatians,4,7,"Therefore you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God."
Galatians,4,8,"However at that time, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods."
Galatians,4,9,"But now, having known God, or rather having been known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things, to which you want to be enslaved all over again?"
Galatians,4,10,You observe days and months and seasons and years.
Galatians,4,11,"I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you for nothing."
Galatians,4,12,"I beg of you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You have done me no wrong."
Galatians,4,13,But you know that it was because of a bodily illness that I proclaimed the gospel to you the first time
Galatians,4,14,"and that which was a trial to you in my bodily condition you did not despise or loathe, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus Himself."
Galatians,4,15,"Where then is that sense of blessing you had? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me."
Galatians,4,16,So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?
Galatians,4,17,"They zealously seek you, not commendably, but they wish to shut you out so that you will zealously seek them."
Galatians,4,18,"But it is good always to be zealously sought in a commendable manner, and not only when I am present with you."
Galatians,4,19,"My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you"
Galatians,4,20,"but I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone, because I am perplexed about you."
Galatians,4,21,"Tell me, you who want to be under law, do you not listen to the Law?"
Galatians,4,22,"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant-woman and one by the free woman."
Galatians,4,23,"But the son by the servant-woman had been born according to the flesh, while the son by the free woman through the promise."
Galatians,4,24,"This is spoken with allegory, for these women are two covenants: one from Mount Sinai bearing children into slavery; she is Hagar."
Galatians,4,25,"Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children."
Galatians,4,26,But the Jerusalem above is free; she is our mother.
Galatians,4,27,"For it is written,
“REJOICE, BARREN WOMAN WHO DOES NOT GIVE BIRTH;
BREAK FORTH AND SHOUT, YOU WHO ARE NOT IN LABOR;
FOR MORE NUMEROUS ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE DESOLATE ONE
THAN OF THE ONE WHO HAS A HUSBAND.”"
Galatians,4,28,"And you brothers, in accordance with Isaac, are children of promise."
Galatians,4,29,"But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh was persecuting him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now also."
Galatians,4,30,"But what does the Scripture say?
“CAST OUT THE SERVANT-WOMAN AND HER SON,
FOR THE SON OF THE SERVANT-WOMAN SHALL NOT BE AN HEIR WITH THE SON OF THE FREE WOMAN.”"
Galatians,4,31,"So then, brothers, we are not children of a servant-woman, but of the free woman."
Galatians,5,1,"It was for freedom that Christ set us free. Therefore, stand firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery."
Galatians,5,2,"Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you."
Galatians,5,3,"And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law."
Galatians,5,4,"You have been severed from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace!"
Galatians,5,5,"For we through the Spirit, by faith, are eagerly waiting for the hope of righteousness."
Galatians,5,6,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love."
Galatians,5,7,You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?
Galatians,5,8,This persuasion is not from Him who calls you.
Galatians,5,9,A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
Galatians,5,10,"I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt no other view. But the one who is disturbing you will bear his judgment, whoever he is."
Galatians,5,11,"But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross would have been abolished."
Galatians,5,12,I wish that those who are upsetting you would even mutilate themselves.
Galatians,5,13,"For you were called to freedom, brothers; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another."
Galatians,5,14,"For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in this: “YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.”"
Galatians,5,15,"But if you bite and devour one another, beware that you are not consumed by one another."
Galatians,5,16,"But I say, walk by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh."
Galatians,5,17,"For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you do not do the things that you want."
Galatians,5,18,"But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law."
Galatians,5,19,"Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality"
Galatians,5,20,"idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions"
Galatians,5,21,"envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God."
Galatians,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness"
Galatians,5,23,"gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law."
Galatians,5,24,Now those who belong to Christ Jesus crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
Galatians,5,25,"If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk in step with the Spirit."
Galatians,5,26,"Let us not become those with vain glory, challenging one another, envying one another."
Galatians,6,1,"Brothers, even if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, each of you looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted."
Galatians,6,2,"Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ."
Galatians,6,3,"For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself."
Galatians,6,4,"But each one must examine his own work, and then he will have reason for boasting in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to another."
Galatians,6,5,For each one will bear his own load.
Galatians,6,6,And the one who is instructed in the word is to share in all good things with the one who instructs him.
Galatians,6,7,"Do not be deceived, God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap."
Galatians,6,8,"For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life."
Galatians,6,9,"And let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary."
Galatians,6,10,"So then, while we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who are of the household of the faith."
Galatians,6,11,See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand!
Galatians,6,12,"As many as are wanting to make a good showing in the flesh, these are trying to compel you to be circumcised, simply so that they will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ."
Galatians,6,13,"For those who are circumcised do not even keep the Law themselves, but they want to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh."
Galatians,6,14,"But may it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world."
Galatians,6,15,"For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation."
Galatians,6,16,"And those who will walk in step with this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God."
Galatians,6,17,"From now on let no one cause trouble for me, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus."
Galatians,6,18,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen."
