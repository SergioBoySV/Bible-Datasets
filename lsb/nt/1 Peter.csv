1 Peter,1,1,"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,
T o those who reside as exiles, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who are chosen"
1 Peter,1,2,"according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to the obedience of Jesus Christ and the sprinkling of His blood: May grace and peace be multiplied to you."
1 Peter,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead"
1 Peter,1,4,"to obtain an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, having been kept in heaven for you"
1 Peter,1,5,who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
1 Peter,1,6,"In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials"
1 Peter,1,7,"so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,1,8,"And though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory"
1 Peter,1,9,receiving as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls.
1 Peter,1,10,"Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you, made careful searches and inquiries"
1 Peter,1,11,inquiring to know what time or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He was predicting the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.
1 Peter,1,12,"It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been declared to you through those who proclaimed the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look."
1 Peter,1,13,"Therefore, having girded your minds for action, being sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,1,14,"As obedient children, not being conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance"
1 Peter,1,15,"but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your conduct"
1 Peter,1,16,"because it is written, “YOU SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY.”"
1 Peter,1,17,"And if you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your sojourn"
1 Peter,1,18,knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things like silver or gold from your futile conduct inherited from your forefathers
1 Peter,1,19,"but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ."
1 Peter,1,20,"He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but appeared in these last times for the sake of you"
1 Peter,1,21,"who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God."
1 Peter,1,22,"Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a love of the brothers without hypocrisy, fervently love one another from the heart"
1 Peter,1,23,"for you have been born again not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, that is, through the living and enduring word of God."
1 Peter,1,24,"For,
“ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS,
AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS.
THE GRASS WITHERS,
AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF"
1 Peter,1,25,"BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER.”
And this is the word which was proclaimed to you as good news."
1 Peter,2,1,"Therefore, laying aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander"
1 Peter,2,2,"like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation"
1 Peter,2,3,if you have TASTED THE KINDNESS OF THE LORD.
1 Peter,2,4,"And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God"
1 Peter,2,5,"you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
1 Peter,2,6,"For this is contained in Scripture:
“BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone,
AND HE WHO BELIEVES UPON HIM WILL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME.”"
1 Peter,2,7,"This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for those who disbelieve,
“THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED,
THIS HAS BECOME THE CHIEF CORNER stone,”"
1 Peter,2,8,"and,
“A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE.”
They stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this stumbling they were also appointed."
1 Peter,2,9,"But you are A CHOSEN FAMILY, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God’s OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light"
1 Peter,2,10,"for you once were NOT A PEOPLE, but now you are THE PEOPLE OF GOD; you had NOT RECEIVED MERCY, but now you have RECEIVED MERCY."
1 Peter,2,11,"Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul"
1 Peter,2,12,"by keeping your conduct excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good works, as they observe them, glorify God in the DAY OF VISITATION."
1 Peter,2,13,"Be subject for the sake of the Lord to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority"
1 Peter,2,14,or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do good.
1 Peter,2,15,For such is the will of God that by doing good you may silence the ignorance of foolish men.
1 Peter,2,16,"Act as free people, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as slaves of God."
1 Peter,2,17,"Honor all people, love the brethren, fear God, honor the king."
1 Peter,2,18,"Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are crooked."
1 Peter,2,19,"For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unrighteously."
1 Peter,2,20,"For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it, you endure, this finds favor with God."
1 Peter,2,21,"For to this you have been called, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example that you should follow in His steps"
1 Peter,2,22,"WHO DID NO SIN, NOR WAS ANY DECEIT FOUND IN HIS MOUTH"
1 Peter,2,23,"who being reviled, was not reviling in return; while suffering, He was uttering no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously."
1 Peter,2,24,"Who Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, so that having died to sin, we might live to righteousness; by His WOUNDS YOU WERE HEALED."
1 Peter,2,25,"For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls."
1 Peter,3,1,"In the same way, you wives, be subject to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives"
1 Peter,3,2,as they observe your pure conduct with fear.
1 Peter,3,3,"Your adornment must not be merely external—braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on garments"
1 Peter,3,4,"but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible quality of a lowly and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God."
1 Peter,3,5,"For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being subject to their own husbands"
1 Peter,3,6,"just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. You have become her children if you do good, NOT FEARING ANY INTIMIDATION."
1 Peter,3,7,"You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with a weaker vessel, since she is a woman; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered."
1 Peter,3,8,"Now to sum up, all of you be like-minded, sympathetic, brotherly, tender-hearted, and humble in spirit"
1 Peter,3,9,"not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but giving a blessing instead, for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing."
1 Peter,3,10,"For,
“THE ONE WHO DESIRES LIFE, TO LOVE AND SEE GOOD DAYS,
MUST KEEP HIS TONGUE FROM EVIL AND HIS LIPS FROM SPEAKING DECEIT."
1 Peter,3,11,"“HE MUST TURN AWAY FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD;
HE MUST SEEK PEACE AND PURSUE IT."
1 Peter,3,12,"“FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE TOWARD THE RIGHTEOUS,
AND HIS EARS ATTEND TO THEIR PRAYER,
BUT THE FACE OF THE LORD IS AGAINST THOSE WHO DO EVIL.”"
1 Peter,3,13,And who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good?
1 Peter,3,14,"But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. AND DO NOT FEAR THEIR FEAR, AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED"
1 Peter,3,15,"but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and fear"
1 Peter,3,16,"having a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who disparage your good conduct in Christ will be put to shame."
1 Peter,3,17,"For it is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing good rather than for doing wrong."
1 Peter,3,18,"For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, so that He might bring you to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit"
1 Peter,3,19,in which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison
1 Peter,3,20,"who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through the water."
1 Peter,3,21,"Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you—not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal of a good conscience to God—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ"
1 Peter,3,22,"who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him."
1 Peter,4,1,"Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose—because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin"
1 Peter,4,2,"so as to no longer live the rest of the time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God."
1 Peter,4,3,"For the time already past is sufficient for you to have worked out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries."
1 Peter,4,4,"In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same excesses of dissipation, maligning you"
1 Peter,4,5,but they will give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
1 Peter,4,6,"For to this the gospel has been proclaimed even to those who are now dead, so that though they were judged in the flesh as men, they live in the spirit according to the will of God."
1 Peter,4,7,"The end of all things is at hand; therefore, be of sound thinking and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer."
1 Peter,4,8,"Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because LOVE COVERS A MULTITUDE OF SINS."
1 Peter,4,9,Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.
1 Peter,4,10,"As each one has received a gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God"
1 Peter,4,11,"whoever speaks, as one speaking the oracles of God; whoever serves, as one serving by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and might forever and ever. Amen."
1 Peter,4,12,"Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you."
1 Peter,4,13,"But to the degree you are sharing the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exultation."
1 Peter,4,14,"If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you."
1 Peter,4,15,"Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler"
1 Peter,4,16,"but if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be put to shame, but is to glorify God in this name."
1 Peter,4,17,"For it is time for judgment to begin with the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?"
1 Peter,4,18,"AND IF IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE RIGHTEOUS IS SAVED, WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE GODLESS MAN AND THE SINNER?"
1 Peter,4,19,"Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of God must entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing good."
1 Peter,5,1,"Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed"
1 Peter,5,2,"shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion, but willingly, according to God; and not for dishonest gain, but with eagerness"
1 Peter,5,3,"nor yet as lording it over those allotted to you, but being examples to the flock."
1 Peter,5,4,"And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory."
1 Peter,5,5,"You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders. And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE."
1 Peter,5,6,"Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time"
1 Peter,5,7,"CASTING ALL YOUR ANXIETY ON HIM, because He cares for you."
1 Peter,5,8,"Be of sober spirit, be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour."
1 Peter,5,9,"But resist him, firm in the faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished among your brethren who are in the world."
1 Peter,5,10,"And after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself restore, strengthen, confirm, and ground you."
1 Peter,5,11,To Him be might forever and ever. Amen.
1 Peter,5,12,"Through Silvanus, our faithful brother as I regard him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and bearing witness that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it!"
1 Peter,5,13,"She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son, Mark."
1 Peter,5,14,"Greet one another with a kiss of love.
P eace be to you all who are in Christ."
