Mark,1,1,"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God."
Mark,1,2,"As it is written in Isaiah the prophet:
“BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER AHEAD OF YOU,
WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY"
Mark,1,3,"THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS,
‘MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD,
MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT.’ ”"
Mark,1,4,John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
Mark,1,5,"And all the region of Judea was going out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins."
Mark,1,6,And John was clothed with camel’s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and was eating locusts and wild honey.
Mark,1,7,"And he was preaching, saying, “After me One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to stoop down and untie the strap of His sandals."
Mark,1,8,I baptized you with water; but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
Mark,1,9,Now it happened that in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
Mark,1,10,"And immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opening, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him"
Mark,1,11,"and a voice came out of the heavens: “You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased.”"
Mark,1,12,And immediately the Spirit *drove Him to go out into the wilderness.
Mark,1,13,"And He was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan; and He was with the wild beasts, and the angels were ministering to Him."
Mark,1,14,"Now after John had been delivered up into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God"
Mark,1,15,"and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”"
Mark,1,16,"As He was going along by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen."
Mark,1,17,"And Jesus said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you become fishers of men.”"
Mark,1,18,And immediately they left their nets and followed Him.
Mark,1,19,"And going on a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets."
Mark,1,20,"And immediately He called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went away to follow Him."
Mark,1,21,And they *went into Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and began to teach.
Mark,1,22,"And they were astonished at His teaching; for He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes."
Mark,1,23,And immediately there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit; and he cried out
Mark,1,24,"saying, “What do we have to do with You, Jesus the Nazarene? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”"
Mark,1,25,"And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet, and come out of him!”"
Mark,1,26,"And throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him."
Mark,1,27,"And they were all amazed, so that they were arguing among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.”"
Mark,1,28,And immediately the news about Him spread everywhere into all the surrounding district of Galilee.
Mark,1,29,"And immediately after they came out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John."
Mark,1,30,Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever; and immediately they *spoke to Jesus about her.
Mark,1,31,"And He came to her and raised her up, taking her by the hand, and the fever left her, and she began waiting on them."
Mark,1,32,"Now when evening came, after the sun had set, they began bringing to Him all who were ill and those who were demon-possessed."
Mark,1,33,And the whole city had gathered at the door.
Mark,1,34,"And He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and He was not permitting the demons to speak, because they knew who He was."
Mark,1,35,"And in the early morning, while it was still dark, Jesus rose up, went out of the house, and went away to a desolate place, and was praying there."
Mark,1,36,And Simon and his companions searched for Him
Mark,1,37,"and they found Him, and *said to Him, “Everyone is looking for You.”"
Mark,1,38,"And He *said to them, “Let us go elsewhere, to the towns nearby, so that I may preach there also; for that is what I came out for.”"
Mark,1,39,"And He went, preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee and casting out the demons."
Mark,1,40,"And a leper *came to Jesus, pleading with Him and falling on his knees before Him, and saying, “If You are willing, You can make me clean.”"
Mark,1,41,"And moved with compassion, He stretched out His hand and touched him, and *said to him, “I am willing; be cleansed.”"
Mark,1,42,And immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.
Mark,1,43,And He sternly warned him and immediately sent him away
Mark,1,44,"and He *said to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”"
Mark,1,45,"But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news around, to such an extent that Jesus could no longer publicly enter a city, but stayed out in desolate areas; and they were coming to Him from everywhere."
Mark,2,1,"And when He had come back to Capernaum several days afterward, it was heard that He was at home."
Mark,2,2,"And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room, not even near the door; and He was speaking the word to them."
Mark,2,3,"And they *came, bringing to Him a paralytic, carried by four men."
Mark,2,4,"And being unable to bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they removed the roof over where He was; and when they had dug an opening, they let down the mat where the paralytic was lying."
Mark,2,5,"And Jesus seeing their faith *said to the paralytic, “Child, your sins are forgiven.”"
Mark,2,6,But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts
Mark,2,7,“Why does this man speak that way? He is blaspheming; who can forgive sins but God alone?”
Mark,2,8,"Immediately Jesus, aware in His spirit that they were reasoning that way within themselves, *said to them, “Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?"
Mark,2,9,"Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven’; or to say, ‘Get up, and pick up your mat and walk’?"
Mark,2,10,But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—He *said to the paralytic
Mark,2,11,"“I say to you, get up, pick up your mat, and go to your home.”"
Mark,2,12,"And he got up and immediately picked up the mat and went out before everyone, so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this.”"
Mark,2,13,"And He went out again by the seashore; and the entire crowd was coming to Him, and He was teaching them."
Mark,2,14,"And as He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting in the tax office, and He *said to him, “Follow Me!” And he stood up and followed Him."
Mark,2,15,"And it *happened that as He was reclining at the table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and His disciples. For there were many of them, and they were following Him."
Mark,2,16,"And when the scribes of the Pharisees saw that He was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they were saying to His disciples, “He is eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners!”"
Mark,2,17,"And hearing this, Jesus *said to them, “Those who are healthy do not have need for a physician, but only those who are sick; I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”"
Mark,2,18,"And John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and they *came and *said to Him, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?”"
Mark,2,19,"And Jesus said to them, “Can the attendants of the bridegroom fast when the bridegroom is with them? So long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
Mark,2,20,"But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day."
Mark,2,21,"“No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise that patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear results."
Mark,2,22,"And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost and the skins as well; but one puts new wine into fresh wineskins.”"
Mark,2,23,"And it happened that He was passing through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to make their way along while picking the heads of grain."
Mark,2,24,"And the Pharisees were saying to Him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”"
Mark,2,25,"And He *said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions became hungry"
Mark,2,26,"how he entered the house of God around the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests, and he also gave it to those who were with him?”"
Mark,2,27,"And Jesus was saying to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath."
Mark,2,28,Consequently the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”
Mark,3,1,And He entered again into a synagogue; and a man was there with a withered hand.
Mark,3,2,"And they were watching Him to see if He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him."
Mark,3,3,"And He *said to the man with the withered hand, “Get up and come forward!”"
Mark,3,4,"And He *said to them, “Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to kill?” But they kept silent."
Mark,3,5,"And after looking around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, He *said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored."
Mark,3,6,"And the Pharisees went out and immediately began taking counsel together with the Herodians against Him, as to how they might destroy Him."
Mark,3,7,And Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples; and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Judea
Mark,3,8,"and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon, a great number of people heard of all that He was doing and came to Him."
Mark,3,9,"And He told His disciples that a boat should stand ready for Him because of the crowd, so that they would not crowd Him"
Mark,3,10,"for He had healed many, with the result that all those who had afflictions pressed around Him in order to touch Him."
Mark,3,11,"And whenever the unclean spirits were seeing Him, they would fall down before Him and cry out, saying, “You are the Son of God!”"
Mark,3,12,And He earnestly warned them not to tell who He was.
Mark,3,13,"And He *went up on the mountain and *summoned those whom He Himself wanted, and they came to Him."
Mark,3,14,And He appointed twelve (whom He also named apostles) to be with Him and to send them out to preach
Mark,3,15,and to have authority to cast out the demons.
Mark,3,16,And He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom He gave the name Peter)
Mark,3,17,"and James, the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James (to them He gave the name Boanerges, which means, “Sons of Thunder”)"
Mark,3,18,"and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot"
Mark,3,19,"and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him."
Mark,3,20,"And He *came home, and the crowd *gathered again, so that they could not even eat a meal."
Mark,3,21,"And when His own people heard this, they went out to take custody of Him; for they were saying, “He has lost His senses.”"
Mark,3,22,"And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and “He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons.”"
Mark,3,23,"And He called them to Himself and began speaking to them in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan?"
Mark,3,24,"And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand."
Mark,3,25,"And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand."
Mark,3,26,"And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but he is finished!"
Mark,3,27,"But no one can enter the strong man’s house and plunder his property unless he first binds the strong man, and then he will plunder his house."
Mark,3,28,"“Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter"
Mark,3,29,"but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin”"
Mark,3,30,"because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”"
Mark,3,31,"Then His mother and His brothers *arrived, and standing outside they sent word to Him, calling Him."
Mark,3,32,"And a crowd was sitting around Him, and they *said to Him, “Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are outside looking for You.”"
Mark,3,33,"And answering them, He *said, “Who are My mother and My brothers?”"
Mark,3,34,"And looking about at those who were sitting around Him, He *said, “Behold My mother and My brothers!"
Mark,3,35,"For whoever does the will of God, he is My brother and sister and mother.”"
Mark,4,1,And He began to teach again by the sea. And such a very large crowd gathered to Him that He got into a boat in the sea and sat down; and the whole crowd was by the sea on the land.
Mark,4,2,"And He was teaching them many things in parables, and was saying to them in His teaching"
Mark,4,3,"“Listen to this! Behold, the sower went out to sow"
Mark,4,4,"and it happened that as he was sowing, some seed fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate it up."
Mark,4,5,And other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil.
Mark,4,6,"And after the sun rose, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away."
Mark,4,7,"And other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no crop."
Mark,4,8,"And other seeds fell into the good soil, and as they grew up and increased, they were yielding a crop and produced thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.”"
Mark,4,9,"And He was saying, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”"
Mark,4,10,"And when He was alone, His followers, along with the twelve, began asking Him about the parables."
Mark,4,11,"And He was saying to them, “To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, everything comes in parables"
Mark,4,12,"so that WHILE SEEING, THEY MAY SEE AND NOT PERCEIVE, AND WHILE HEARING, THEY MAY HEAR AND NOT UNDERSTAND, LEST THEY RETURN AND BE FORGIVEN.”"
Mark,4,13,"And He *said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? How will you understand all the parables?"
Mark,4,14,The sower sows the word.
Mark,4,15,"And these are the ones who are beside the road where the word is sown: when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them."
Mark,4,16,"And in a similar way, these are the ones being sown on the rocky places: those who, when hearing the word, immediately receive it with joy"
Mark,4,17,"and they have no root in themselves, but are only temporary; then, when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they fall away."
Mark,4,18,And others are those being sown among the thorns; these are the ones who have heard the word
Mark,4,19,"but the worries of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for anything else enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful."
Mark,4,20,"And those are the ones which were sown on the good soil: they who hear the word and accept it and are bearing fruit, thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.”"
Mark,4,21,"And He was saying to them, “Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be put on the lampstand?"
Mark,4,22,"For nothing is hidden, except to be revealed; nor has anything been secret, but that it would come to light."
Mark,4,23,"If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”"
Mark,4,24,"And He was saying to them, “Beware what you listen to. By your standard of measure it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you."
Mark,4,25,"For whoever has, to him more shall be given; and whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.”"
Mark,4,26,"And He was saying, “The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the soil"
Mark,4,27,"and he sleeps and rises, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows—how, he himself does not know."
Mark,4,28,"The soil produces crops by itself; first the blade, then the head, then the mature grain in the head."
Mark,4,29,"But when the grain is ripe, he immediately puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”"
Mark,4,30,"And He was saying, “How shall we compare the kingdom of God, or by what parable shall we present it?"
Mark,4,31,"It is like a mustard seed, which, when sown upon the soil, though it is smallest of all the seeds that are upon the soil"
Mark,4,32,"yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes largest of all the garden plants and forms large branches; so that THE BIRDS OF THE AIR can NEST UNDER ITS SHADE.”"
Mark,4,33,"And with many such parables He was speaking the word to them, as they were able to hear it"
Mark,4,34,and He was not speaking to them without a parable; but He was explaining everything privately to His own disciples.
Mark,4,35,"And on that day, when evening came, He *said to them, “Let us go over to the other side.”"
Mark,4,36,"And leaving the crowd, they *took Him along with them in the boat, just as He was; and other boats were with Him."
Mark,4,37,"And a great windstorm *arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat so that the boat was already filling up."
Mark,4,38,"And Jesus Himself was in the stern, sleeping on the cushion; and they *got Him up and *said to Him, “Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?”"
Mark,4,39,"And He woke up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, “Silence! Be still.” And the wind died down and it became perfectly calm."
Mark,4,40,"And He said to them, “Why are you so cowardly? Do you still have no faith?”"
Mark,4,41,"And they became very afraid and were saying to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?”"
Mark,5,1,"Then they came to the other side of the sea, into the region of the Gerasenes."
Mark,5,2,"And when He got out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met Him"
Mark,5,3,"who had his dwelling among the tombs. And no one was able to bind him anymore, even with a chain"
Mark,5,4,"because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles broken in pieces, and no one was strong enough to subdue him."
Mark,5,5,"And constantly, night and day, among the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out and gashing himself with stones."
Mark,5,6,"And seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran up and bowed down before Him"
Mark,5,7,"and crying out with a loud voice, he *said, “What do I have to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore You by God, do not torment me!”"
Mark,5,8,"For He had been saying to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”"
Mark,5,9,"And He was asking him, “What is your name?” And he *said to Him, “My name is Legion; for we are many.”"
Mark,5,10,And he began pleading with Him earnestly not to send them out of the region.
Mark,5,11,Now there was a large herd of swine feeding nearby on the mountain.
Mark,5,12,"And the demons pleaded with Him, saying, “Send us into the swine so that we may enter them.”"
Mark,5,13,"And Jesus gave them permission. And coming out, the unclean spirits entered the swine; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, about two thousand of them; and they were drowned in the sea."
Mark,5,14,And their herdsmen ran away and reported it in the city and in the countryside. And the people came to see what it was that had happened.
Mark,5,15,"And they *came to Jesus and *observed the demon-possessed man sitting down, clothed and in his right mind, the very man who had the “legion”; and they became frightened."
Mark,5,16,"And those who had seen it recounted to them how this had happened to the demon-possessed man, and all about the swine."
Mark,5,17,And they began to plead with Him to leave their region.
Mark,5,18,"And as He was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed was pleading with Him that he might accompany Him."
Mark,5,19,"And He did not let him, but He *said to him, “Go home to your people and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He had mercy on you.”"
Mark,5,20,And he went away and began to preach in the Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him; and everyone was marveling.
Mark,5,21,"And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him; and so He stayed by the seashore."
Mark,5,22,"And one of the synagogue officials named Jairus *came up, and on seeing Him, *fell at His feet"
Mark,5,23,"and *pleaded with Him earnestly, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death; please come, that by coming, You may lay Your hands on her, so that she will be saved and live.”"
Mark,5,24,And He went off with him; and a large crowd was following Him and pressing in on Him.
Mark,5,25,And a woman—who had a hemorrhage for twelve years
Mark,5,26,"and had endured much at the hands of many physicians, and had spent all that she had and was not helped at all, but rather had grown worse"
Mark,5,27,"after hearing about Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind Him and touched His garment."
Mark,5,28,"For she was saying, “If I just touch His garments, I will be saved from this.”"
Mark,5,29,And immediately the flow of her blood was dried up; and she knew within her body that she had been healed of her affliction.
Mark,5,30,"And immediately Jesus, perceiving in Himself that the power proceeding from Him had gone forth, turned around in the crowd and was saying, “Who touched My garments?”"
Mark,5,31,"And His disciples were saying to Him, “You see the crowd pressing in on You, and You say, ‘Who touched Me?’ ”"
Mark,5,32,And He was looking around to see the woman who had done this.
Mark,5,33,"But the woman fearing and trembling, aware of what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth."
Mark,5,34,"And He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has saved you; go in peace and be healed of your affliction.”"
Mark,5,35,"While He was still speaking, they *came from the house of the synagogue official, saying, “Your daughter has died; why trouble the Teacher anymore?”"
Mark,5,36,"But Jesus, overhearing what had been spoken, *said to the synagogue official, “Do not be afraid, only believe.”"
Mark,5,37,"And He allowed no one to accompany Him, except Peter and James and John the brother of James."
Mark,5,38,"And they *came to the house of the synagogue official; and He *saw a commotion, and people loudly crying and wailing."
Mark,5,39,"And entering in, He *said to them, “Why are you making a commotion and crying? The child has not died, but is asleep.”"
Mark,5,40,"And they began laughing at Him. But putting them all out, He *took along the child’s father and mother and His own companions, and *entered the room where the child was."
Mark,5,41,"And taking the child by the hand, He *said to her, “Talitha kum!” (which translated means, “Little girl, I say to you, arise!”)."
Mark,5,42,"And immediately the little girl stood up and began to walk, for she was twelve years old. And immediately they were completely astounded."
Mark,5,43,"And He gave them strict orders that no one should know about this, and He said that some food should be given to her to eat."
Mark,6,1,And Jesus went out from there and *came into His hometown; and His disciples *followed Him.
Mark,6,2,"And when the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue; and many listeners were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things, and what is this wisdom given to this man, and such miracles as these performed by His hands?"
Mark,6,3,"Is this man not the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are not His sisters here with us?” And they were taking offense at Him."
Mark,6,4,"And Jesus was saying to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and among his own relatives and in his own household.”"
Mark,6,5,And He could do no miracle there except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.
Mark,6,6,"And He was marveling at their unbelief.
A nd He was going around the villages teaching."
Mark,6,7,"And He *summoned the twelve and began to send them out in pairs, and was giving them authority over the unclean spirits"
Mark,6,8,"and He instructed them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only—no bread, no bag, no money in their belt"
Mark,6,9,"but to wear sandals; and He added, “Do not put on two tunics.”"
Mark,6,10,"And He was saying to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave town."
Mark,6,11,"And any place that does not receive you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake the dust off the soles of your feet for a testimony against them.”"
Mark,6,12,And they went out and preached that men should repent.
Mark,6,13,And they were casting out many demons and were anointing with oil many sick people and healing them.
Mark,6,14,"And King Herod heard it, for His name had become well known; and people were saying, “John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in Him.”"
Mark,6,15,"But others were saying, “He is Elijah.” And others were saying, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.”"
Mark,6,16,"But when Herod heard it, he kept saying, “John, whom I beheaded, has risen!”"
Mark,6,17,"For Herod himself had sent and had John arrested and bound in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because he had married her."
Mark,6,18,"For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”"
Mark,6,19,Now Herodias was holding a grudge against him and was wanting to put him to death and was not able
Mark,6,20,"for Herod was afraid of John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he was keeping him safe. And when he heard him, he was very perplexed; but he used to enjoy listening to him."
Mark,6,21,And a strategic day came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his great men and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee
Mark,6,22,"and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests; and the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you.”"
Mark,6,23,"And he swore to her, “Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you; up to half of my kingdom.”"
Mark,6,24,"And she went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?” And she said, “The head of John the Baptist.”"
Mark,6,25,"And immediately she came in a hurry to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”"
Mark,6,26,"And although the king was very sorry, yet because of his oaths and because of his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her."
Mark,6,27,And immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded him to bring back his head. And he went and beheaded him in the prison
Mark,6,28,"and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother."
Mark,6,29,"And when his disciples heard this, they came and took away his body and laid it in a tomb."
Mark,6,30,And the apostles *gathered together with Jesus; and they reported to Him all that they had done and taught.
Mark,6,31,"And He *said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.” (For there were many people coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.)"
Mark,6,32,And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves.
Mark,6,33,"And the people saw them going, and many recognized them and ran there together on foot from all the cities, and got there ahead of them."
Mark,6,34,"And when Jesus went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and He felt compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and He began to teach them many things."
Mark,6,35,"And when it was already quite late, His disciples came to Him and began saying, “This place is desolate and it is already quite late"
Mark,6,36,send them away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”
Mark,6,37,"But He answered and said to them, “You give them something to eat!” And they *said to Him, “Shall we go and spend two hundred denarii on bread and give them something to eat?”"
Mark,6,38,"And He *said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go look!” And when they found out, they *said, “Five, and two fish.”"
Mark,6,39,And He commanded them all to sit down by groups on the green grass.
Mark,6,40,And they sat down in groups of hundreds and of fifties.
Mark,6,41,"And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed the food and broke the loaves. And He kept giving them to the disciples to set before them, and He divided up the two fish among them all."
Mark,6,42,And they all ate and were satisfied
Mark,6,43,"and they picked up twelve full baskets of the broken pieces, and also of the fish."
Mark,6,44,And there were five thousand men who ate the loaves.
Mark,6,45,"And immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side to Bethsaida, while He Himself was sending the crowd away."
Mark,6,46,"And after bidding them farewell, He left for the mountain to pray."
Mark,6,47,"And when it was evening, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and He was alone on the land."
Mark,6,48,"And seeing them straining at the oars, for the wind was against them, at about the fourth watch of the night He *came to them, walking on the sea; and He was intending to pass by them."
Mark,6,49,"But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they thought that it was a ghost, and cried out"
Mark,6,50,"for they all saw Him and were terrified. But immediately He spoke with them and *said to them, “Take courage; it is I, do not be afraid.”"
Mark,6,51,"Then He got into the boat with them, and the wind stopped; and they were utterly amazed"
Mark,6,52,"for they had not gained any insight about the loaves, but their heart was hardened."
Mark,6,53,"And when they had crossed over they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore."
Mark,6,54,"And when they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognized Him"
Mark,6,55,"and ran about that whole region and began to carry here and there on their mats those who were sick, to the place they heard He was."
Mark,6,56,"And wherever He was entering villages, or cities, or countryside, they were laying the sick in the marketplaces, and pleading with Him that they might just touch the fringe of His garment; and as many as touched it were being saved from their sicknesses."
Mark,7,1,And the Pharisees and some of the scribes *gathered around Him when they had come from Jerusalem
Mark,7,2,"and had seen that some of His disciples were eating their bread with defiled hands, that is, unwashed."
Mark,7,3,"(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they carefully wash their hands, thus observing the tradition of the elders"
Mark,7,4,"and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash themselves; and there are many other things which they have received in order to observe, such as the washing of cups and pitchers and copper pots.)"
Mark,7,5,"And the Pharisees and the scribes *asked Him, “Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with defiled hands?”"
Mark,7,6,"And He said to them, “Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written:
‘THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS,
BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME."
Mark,7,7,"‘BUT IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME,
TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE COMMANDS OF MEN.’"
Mark,7,8,"Leaving the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men.”"
Mark,7,9,"And He was also saying to them, “You are good at setting aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition."
Mark,7,10,"For Moses said, ‘HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER’; and, ‘HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER, IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH’"
Mark,7,11,"but you say, ‘If a man says to his father or his mother, whatever you might benefit from me is Corban (that is to say, given to God),’"
Mark,7,12,you no longer leave him to do anything for his father or his mother
Mark,7,13,thus invalidating the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down; and you do many things such as that.”
Mark,7,14,"And after He called the crowd to Him again, He began saying to them, “Listen to Me, all of you, and understand"
Mark,7,15,there is nothing outside the man which can defile him if it goes into him; but the things which proceed out of the man are what defile the man.
Mark,7,16,"[And if anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”]"
Mark,7,17,"And when He had left the crowd and entered the house, His disciples were asking Him about the parable."
Mark,7,18,"And He *said to them, “Are you lacking understanding in this way as well? Do you not perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside cannot defile him"
Mark,7,19,"because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and goes to the sewer?” (Thus He declared all foods clean.)"
Mark,7,20,"And He was saying, “That which proceeds out of the man, that is what defiles the man."
Mark,7,21,"For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed the evil thoughts, sexual immoralities, thefts, murders, adulteries"
Mark,7,22,"coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness."
Mark,7,23,All these evil things proceed from within and defile the man.”
Mark,7,24,"Now Jesus stood up and went away from there to the region of Tyre. And when He had entered a house, He was wanting no one to know of it; yet He could not escape notice."
Mark,7,25,"But after hearing of Him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately came and fell at His feet."
Mark,7,26,"Now the woman was a Greek, of Syrophoenician descent. And she kept asking Him to cast the demon out of her daughter."
Mark,7,27,"And He was saying to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”"
Mark,7,28,"But she answered and *said to Him, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table feed on the children’s crumbs.”"
Mark,7,29,"And He said to her, “Because of this answer go; the demon has gone out of your daughter.”"
Mark,7,30,"And going back to her home, she found the child lying on the bed, the demon having left."
Mark,7,31,"And again He went out from the region of Tyre, and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of the Decapolis."
Mark,7,32,"And they *brought to Him one who was deaf and spoke with difficulty, and they *pleaded with Him to lay His hand on him."
Mark,7,33,"And Jesus took him aside from the crowd, by himself, and put His fingers into his ears, and after spitting, He touched his tongue"
Mark,7,34,"and looking up to heaven with a sigh, He *said to him, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!”"
Mark,7,35,"And his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was removed, and he began speaking plainly."
Mark,7,36,"And He gave them orders not to tell anyone; but the more He was ordering them, the more widely they continued to proclaim it."
Mark,7,37,"And they were utterly astonished, saying, “He has done all things well; He makes even the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.”"
Mark,8,1,"In those days, when there was again a large crowd and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples and *said to them"
Mark,8,2,“I feel compassion for the crowd because they have remained with Me now three days and have nothing to eat.
Mark,8,3,"And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come from a great distance.”"
Mark,8,4,"And His disciples answered Him, “Where will anyone be able to find enough bread here in this desolate place to satisfy these people?”"
Mark,8,5,"And He was asking them, “How many loaves do you have?” And they said, “Seven.”"
Mark,8,6,"And He *directed the crowd to sit down on the ground; and taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks and broke them. And He kept giving them to His disciples to serve to them, and they served them to the crowd."
Mark,8,7,"And they also had a few small fish; and after He blessed them, He ordered these to be served as well."
Mark,8,8,And they ate and were satisfied; and they picked up seven large baskets full of what was left over of the broken pieces.
Mark,8,9,"Now about four thousand were there, and He sent them away."
Mark,8,10,And immediately He entered the boat with His disciples and came to the district of Dalmanutha.
Mark,8,11,"And the Pharisees came out and began to argue with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, testing Him."
Mark,8,12,"And sighing deeply in His spirit, He *said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.”"
Mark,8,13,"And leaving them, He again embarked and went away to the other side."
Mark,8,14,"And they had forgotten to take bread, and did not have more than one loaf in the boat with them."
Mark,8,15,"And He was giving orders to them, saying, “Watch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”"
Mark,8,16,And they began to discuss with one another the fact that they had no bread.
Mark,8,17,"And Jesus, aware of this, *said to them, “Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Do you have a hardened heart?"
Mark,8,18,"HAVING EYES, DO YOU NOT SEE? AND HAVING EARS, DO YOU NOT HEAR? And do you not remember"
Mark,8,19,"when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces you picked up?” They *said to Him, “Twelve.”"
Mark,8,20,"“When I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many large baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?” And they *said to Him, “Seven.”"
Mark,8,21,"And He was saying to them, “Do you not yet understand?”"
Mark,8,22,And they *came to Bethsaida. And they *brought a blind man to Jesus and *pleaded with Him to touch him.
Mark,8,23,"And taking the blind man by the hand, He brought him out of the village; and after spitting on his eyes and laying His hands on him, He was asking him, “Do you see anything?”"
Mark,8,24,"And he looked up and was saying, “I see men, for I see them like trees, walking around.”"
Mark,8,25,"Then again He laid His hands on his eyes; and he looked intently and was restored, and began to see everything clearly."
Mark,8,26,"And He sent him to his home, saying, “Do not even enter the village.”"
Mark,8,27,"And Jesus went out, along with His disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He was asking His disciples, saying to them, “Who do people say that I am?”"
Mark,8,28,"And they told Him, saying, “John the Baptist; and others say Elijah; but others, one of the prophets.”"
Mark,8,29,"And He continued asking them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter *answered and *said to Him, “You are the Christ.”"
Mark,8,30,And He warned them to tell no one about Him.
Mark,8,31,"And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again."
Mark,8,32,And He was stating the matter openly. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.
Mark,8,33,"But turning around and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter and *said, “Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on God’s interests, but man’s.”"
Mark,8,34,"And He summoned the crowd with His disciples, and said to them, “If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me."
Mark,8,35,"For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel’s will save it."
Mark,8,36,"For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?"
Mark,8,37,For what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
Mark,8,38,"For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.”"
Mark,9,1,"And Jesus was saying to them, “Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God having come in power.”"
Mark,9,2,"And six days later, Jesus *took with Him Peter and James and John, and *brought them up on a high mountain alone by themselves. And He was transfigured before them"
Mark,9,3,"and His garments were shining intensely white, as no launderer on earth can whiten them."
Mark,9,4,And Elijah appeared to them along with Moses and they were conversing with Jesus.
Mark,9,5,"And Peter answered and *said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three booths, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”"
Mark,9,6,For he did not know what to answer; for they became terrified.
Mark,9,7,"Then a cloud formed, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is My beloved Son, listen to Him!”"
Mark,9,8,"And all at once when they looked around, they saw no one with them anymore, except Jesus alone."
Mark,9,9,"And as they were coming down from the mountain, He gave them orders not to recount to anyone what they had seen, until the Son of Man rose from the dead."
Mark,9,10,"And they seized upon that statement, arguing with one another what rising from the dead meant."
Mark,9,11,"And they began asking Him, saying, “Why is it that the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”"
Mark,9,12,"And He said to them, “Elijah does first come and restore all things. And yet how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things and be treated with contempt?"
Mark,9,13,"But I say to you that Elijah has indeed come, and they did to him whatever they wished, just as it is written of him.”"
Mark,9,14,"And when they came back to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them."
Mark,9,15,"And immediately, when the entire crowd saw Him, they were amazed. And as they ran up, they were greeting Him."
Mark,9,16,"And He asked them, “What are you arguing with them?”"
Mark,9,17,"And one of the crowd answered Him, “Teacher, I brought You my son, possessed with a spirit which makes him mute"
Mark,9,18,"and whenever it seizes him, it slams him to the ground and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. I told Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not do it.”"
Mark,9,19,"And He *answered them and *said, “O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him to Me!”"
Mark,9,20,"And they brought the boy to Him. When he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into a convulsion, and falling to the ground, he began rolling around, foaming at the mouth."
Mark,9,21,"And He asked his father, “How long has this been happening to him?” And he said, “From childhood."
Mark,9,22,"And it has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!”"
Mark,9,23,"And Jesus said to him, “ ‘If You can?’ All things are possible to him who believes.”"
Mark,9,24,"Immediately the boy’s father cried out and was saying, “I do believe; help my unbelief.”"
Mark,9,25,"Now when Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, “You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and do not enter him again.”"
Mark,9,26,"And after crying out and throwing him into terrible convulsions, it came out; and the boy became so much like a corpse that most of them said, “He is dead!”"
Mark,9,27,But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him; and he stood up.
Mark,9,28,"And when He came into the house, His disciples began questioning Him privately, “Why could we not cast it out?”"
Mark,9,29,"And He said to them, “This kind cannot come out by anything but prayer.”"
Mark,9,30,"From there they went out and were going through Galilee, and He was not wanting anyone to know about it."
Mark,9,31,"For He was teaching His disciples and telling them, “The Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and when He has been killed, He will rise again three days later.”"
Mark,9,32,"But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask Him."
Mark,9,33,"And they came to Capernaum; and when He was in the house, He began to question them, “What were you discussing on the way?”"
Mark,9,34,"But they kept silent, for on the way they had discussed with one another which of them was the greatest."
Mark,9,35,"And sitting down, He called the twelve and *said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.”"
Mark,9,36,"And taking a child, He set him before them. And taking him in His arms, He said to them"
Mark,9,37,"“Whoever receives one child like this in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me does not receive Me, but Him who sent Me.”"
Mark,9,38,"John said to Him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we tried to hinder him because he was not following us.”"
Mark,9,39,"But Jesus said, “Do not hinder him, for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name, and be able soon afterward to speak evil of Me."
Mark,9,40,For he who is not against us is for us.
Mark,9,41,"For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name because you are of Christ, truly I say to you, he will not lose his reward."
Mark,9,42,"“And whoever causes one of these little ones who believe to stumble, it would be better for him if, with a heavy millstone hung around his neck, he had been cast into the sea."
Mark,9,43,"And if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life crippled, than, having your two hands, to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire"
Mark,9,44,"[and where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.]"
Mark,9,45,"And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame, than, having your two feet, to be cast into hell"
Mark,9,46,"[and where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.]"
Mark,9,47,"And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell"
Mark,9,48,"where THEIR WORM DOES NOT DIE, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED."
Mark,9,49,“For everyone will be salted with fire.
Mark,9,50,"Salt is good; but if the salt becomes unsalty, with what will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”"
Mark,10,1,"And standing up, He *went from there to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan; crowds *gathered around Him again, and, according to His custom, He once more began to teach them."
Mark,10,2,"And some Pharisees came up to Jesus, testing Him, and began to question Him whether it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife."
Mark,10,3,"And He answered and said to them, “What did Moses command you?”"
Mark,10,4,"And they said, “Moses permitted a man TO WRITE A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE AND SEND her AWAY.”"
Mark,10,5,"But Jesus said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart he wrote for you this commandment."
Mark,10,6,"But from the beginning of creation, God MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE."
Mark,10,7,FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER
Mark,10,8,"AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH; so they are no longer two, but one flesh."
Mark,10,9,"What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.”"
Mark,10,10,And in the house the disciples began questioning Him about this again.
Mark,10,11,"And He *said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her"
Mark,10,12,"and if she herself divorces her husband and marries another man, she is committing adultery.”"
Mark,10,13,And they were bringing children to Him so that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked them.
Mark,10,14,"But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant and said to them, “Permit the children to come to Me; do not hinder them; for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."
Mark,10,15,"Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all.”"
Mark,10,16,"And He took them in His arms and began blessing them, laying His hands on them."
Mark,10,17,"And as He was setting out on a journey, a man ran up to Him and knelt before Him, and began asking Him, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”"
Mark,10,18,"And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone."
Mark,10,19,"You know the commandments, ‘DO NOT MURDER, DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, DO NOT STEAL, DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS, Do not defraud, HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER.’ ”"
Mark,10,20,"And he said to Him, “Teacher, I have kept all these things from my youth up.”"
Mark,10,21,"And looking at him, Jesus loved him and said to him, “One thing you lack: go and sell all you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”"
Mark,10,22,"But at these words he was saddened, and he went away grieving, for he was one who owned much property."
Mark,10,23,"And Jesus, looking around, *said to His disciples, “How hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!”"
Mark,10,24,"And the disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus *answered again and *said to them, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!"
Mark,10,25,It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”
Mark,10,26,"And they were even more astonished, saying to Him, “Then who can be saved?”"
Mark,10,27,"Looking at them, Jesus *said, “With people it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.”"
Mark,10,28,"Peter began to say to Him, “Behold, we have left everything and followed You.”"
Mark,10,29,"Jesus said, “Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms, for My sake and for the gospel’s sake"
Mark,10,30,"except one who will receive one hundred times as much now in the present age—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms, along with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life."
Mark,10,31,"But many who are first will be last, and the last, first.”"
Mark,10,32,"And they were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking on ahead of them; and they were amazed, and those who followed were fearful. And again He took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him"
Mark,10,33,"“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death and will deliver Him over to the Gentiles."
Mark,10,34,"And they will mock Him and spit on Him, and flog Him and kill Him, and three days later He will rise again.”"
Mark,10,35,"Then James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, *came up to Jesus, saying to Him, “Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You.”"
Mark,10,36,"And He said to them, “What do you want Me to do for you?”"
Mark,10,37,"And they said to Him, “Grant that we may sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory.”"
Mark,10,38,"But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?”"
Mark,10,39,"And they said to Him, “We are able.” And Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you shall drink; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized."
Mark,10,40,"But to sit on My right or on My left, this is not Mine to give; but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”"
Mark,10,41,"And hearing this, the ten began to feel indignant with James and John."
Mark,10,42,"And calling them to Himself, Jesus *said to them, “You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great men exercise authority over them."
Mark,10,43,"But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant"
Mark,10,44,and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all.
Mark,10,45,"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.”"
Mark,10,46,"Then they *came to Jericho. And as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the road."
Mark,10,47,"And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”"
Mark,10,48,"And many were sternly telling him to be quiet, but he kept crying out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”"
Mark,10,49,"And Jesus stopped and said, “Call him here.” So they *called the blind man, saying to him, “Take courage, get up! He is calling for you.”"
Mark,10,50,"And throwing off his outer garment, he jumped up and came to Jesus."
Mark,10,51,"And Jesus answered him and said, “What do you want Me to do for you?” And the blind man said to Him, “Rabboni, I want to regain my sight!”"
Mark,10,52,"And Jesus said to him, “Go; your faith has saved you.” Immediately he regained his sight and began following Him on the road."
Mark,11,1,"And as they *approached Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, He *sent two of His disciples"
Mark,11,2,"and *said to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one yet has ever sat; untie it and bring it here."
Mark,11,3,"And if anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ you say, ‘The Lord has need of it’; and immediately he will send it back here.”"
Mark,11,4,"And they went away and found a colt tied at the door, outside in the street; and they *untied it."
Mark,11,5,"And some of the bystanders were saying to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?”"
Mark,11,6,"And they spoke to them just as Jesus had told them, and they gave them permission."
Mark,11,7,And they *brought the colt to Jesus and put their garments on it; and He sat on it.
Mark,11,8,"And many spread their garments in the road, and others spread leafy branches, having cut them from the fields."
Mark,11,9,"And those who went in front and those who followed were shouting:
“Hosanna!
BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD"
Mark,11,10,"Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David;
Hosanna in the highest!”"
Mark,11,11,"And Jesus entered Jerusalem and came into the temple; and after looking around at everything, He left for Bethany with the twelve, since it was already late."
Mark,11,12,"And on the next day, when they had left Bethany, He became hungry."
Mark,11,13,"And seeing at a distance a fig tree that had leaves, He went to see if perhaps He would find anything on it; and when He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs."
Mark,11,14,"And He answered and said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again!” And His disciples were listening."
Mark,11,15,"Then they *came to Jerusalem. And He entered the temple and began to drive out those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves"
Mark,11,16,and He was not permitting anyone to carry merchandise through the temple.
Mark,11,17,"And He began to teach and say to them, “Is it not written, ‘MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER FOR ALL THE NATIONS’? But you have made it a ROBBERS’ DEN.”"
Mark,11,18,"And the chief priests and the scribes heard this, and began seeking how to destroy Him; for they were afraid of Him, for the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching."
Mark,11,19,"And when evening came, they were going out of the city."
Mark,11,20,"And as they were passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots."
Mark,11,21,"And being reminded, Peter *said to Him, “Rabbi, look, the fig tree which You cursed has withered.”"
Mark,11,22,"And Jesus answered and *said to them, “Have faith in God."
Mark,11,23,"Truly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is going to happen, it will be granted him."
Mark,11,24,"For this reason I say to you, all things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they will be granted to you."
Mark,11,25,"And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions."
Mark,11,26,"[But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your transgressions.”]"
Mark,11,27,"Then they *came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders *came to Him"
Mark,11,28,"and began saying to Him, “By what authority are You doing these things, or who gave You this authority to do these things?”"
Mark,11,29,"And Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question, and you answer Me, and then I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
Mark,11,30,"Was the baptism of John from heaven, or from men? Answer Me.”"
Mark,11,31,"And they began reasoning among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’"
Mark,11,32,"But if we say, ‘From men’?”—they were afraid of the crowd, for everyone was regarding John to have been a real prophet."
Mark,11,33,"And answering Jesus, they *said, “We do not know.” And Jesus *said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”"
Mark,12,1,"And He began to speak to them in parables: “A man PLANTED A VINEYARD AND PUT A WALL AROUND IT, AND DUG A VAT UNDER THE WINE PRESS AND BUILT A TOWER, and rented it out to vine-growers and went on a journey."
Mark,12,2,"And at the harvest time he sent a slave to the vine-growers, in order to receive some of the fruit of the vineyard from the vine-growers."
Mark,12,3,"And they took him, and beat him and sent him away empty-handed."
Mark,12,4,"And again he sent them another slave, and they wounded him in the head, and treated him shamefully."
Mark,12,5,"And he sent another, and that one they killed; and so with many others, beating some and killing others."
Mark,12,6,"He had one more, a beloved son; he sent him last of all to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’"
Mark,12,7,"But those vine-growers said to one another, ‘This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours!’"
Mark,12,8,"And they took him, and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard."
Mark,12,9,"What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vine-growers, and will give the vineyard to others."
Mark,12,10,"Have you not even read this Scripture:
‘THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED,
THIS HAS BECOME THE CHIEF CORNER stone"
Mark,12,11,"THIS CAME ABOUT FROM THE LORD,
AND IT IS MARVELOUS IN OUR EYES’?”"
Mark,12,12,"And they were seeking to seize Him, and yet they feared the crowd, for they understood that He spoke the parable against them. And so they left Him and went away."
Mark,12,13,Then they *sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Him in order to trap Him in a statement.
Mark,12,14,"And they *came and *said to Him, “Teacher, we know that You are truthful and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay a tax to Caesar, or not?"
Mark,12,15,"Shall we pay or shall we not pay?” But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, “Why are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius to look at.”"
Mark,12,16,"And they brought one. And He *said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” And they said to Him, “Caesar’s.”"
Mark,12,17,"And Jesus said to them, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” And they were amazed at Him."
Mark,12,18,"Then some Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection) *came to Jesus, and began questioning Him, saying"
Mark,12,19,"“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that IF A MAN’S BROTHER DIES and leaves behind a wife AND LEAVES NO CHILD, HIS BROTHER SHOULD MARRY THE WIFE AND RAISE UP A SEED FOR HIS BROTHER."
Mark,12,20,"There were seven brothers; and the first married a wife, and died leaving no seed."
Mark,12,21,"And the second one married her, and died leaving behind no seed; and the third likewise"
Mark,12,22,and so all seven left no seed. Last of all the woman died also.
Mark,12,23,"In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For all seven had married her.”"
Mark,12,24,"Jesus said to them, “Is this not the reason you are mistaken, that you do not understand the Scriptures nor the power of God?"
Mark,12,25,"For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven."
Mark,12,26,"But regarding the fact that the dead are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the burning bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB’?"
Mark,12,27,"He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; you are greatly mistaken.”"
Mark,12,28,"And when one of the scribes came and heard them arguing, he recognized that He had answered them well and asked Him, “What commandment is the foremost of all?”"
Mark,12,29,"Jesus answered, “The foremost is, ‘HEAR, O ISRAEL! THE LORD OUR GOD IS ONE LORD"
Mark,12,30,"AND YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH.’"
Mark,12,31,"The second is this, ‘YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”"
Mark,12,32,"And the scribe said to Him, “Right, Teacher; You have truly stated that HE IS ONE, AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE BESIDES HIM"
Mark,12,33,"AND TO LOVE HIM WITH ALL THE HEART AND WITH ALL THE UNDERSTANDING AND WITH ALL THE STRENGTH, AND TO LOVE ONE’S NEIGHBOR AS HIMSELF, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”"
Mark,12,34,"And when Jesus saw that he had answered thoughtfully, He said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” After that, no one would dare to ask Him any more questions."
Mark,12,35,"And Jesus began to say, as He taught in the temple, “How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?"
Mark,12,36,"David himself said in the Holy Spirit,
‘THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD,
“SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND,
UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES BENEATH YOUR FEET.” ’"
Mark,12,37,David himself calls Him ‘Lord’; so in what sense is He his son?” And the large crowd enjoyed listening to Him.
Mark,12,38,"And in His teaching He was saying: “Beware of the scribes who want to walk around in long robes, and want respectful greetings in the marketplaces"
Mark,12,39,and best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets
Mark,12,40,"who devour widows’ houses, and for appearance’s sake offer long prayers; these will receive greater condemnation.”"
Mark,12,41,"And He sat down opposite the treasury, and began observing how the crowd was putting money into the treasury; and many rich people were putting in large sums."
Mark,12,42,"And a poor widow came and put in two lepta, which amount to a quadrans."
Mark,12,43,"And calling His disciples to Him, He said to them, “Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all those putting money into the treasury"
Mark,12,44,"for they all put in out of their surplus, but she, out of her poverty, put in all she owned, all she had to live on.”"
Mark,13,1,"And as He was going out of the temple, one of His disciples *said to Him, “Teacher, behold what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!”"
Mark,13,2,"And Jesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left upon another which will not be torn down.”"
Mark,13,3,"And as He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew were questioning Him privately"
Mark,13,4,"“Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled?”"
Mark,13,5,"And Jesus began to say to them, “See to it that no one deceives you."
Mark,13,6,"Many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am He!’ and will mislead many."
Mark,13,7,"And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; those things must take place; but that is not yet the end."
Mark,13,8,"For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will also be famines. These things are merely the beginning of birth pains."
Mark,13,9,"“But see to yourselves; for they will deliver you to the courts, and you will be beaten in the synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for My sake, as a witness to them."
Mark,13,10,And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations.
Mark,13,11,"And when they lead you away, delivering you up, do not worry beforehand about what you are to say, but say whatever is given to you in that hour; for it is not you who speak, but it is the Holy Spirit."
Mark,13,12,"And brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death."
Mark,13,13,"And you will be hated by all because of My name, but the one who endures to the end, he will be saved."
Mark,13,14,"“But when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains."
Mark,13,15,"And the one who is on the housetop must not go down, or go in to get anything out of his house"
Mark,13,16,and the one who is in the field must not turn back to get his garment.
Mark,13,17,But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!
Mark,13,18,But pray that it may not happen in the winter.
Mark,13,19,"For those days will be a time of tribulation such as has not occurred since the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will."
Mark,13,20,"And unless the Lord had shortened those days, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom He chose, He shortened the days."
Mark,13,21,"And then if anyone says to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ’; or, ‘Behold, He is there’; do not believe him"
Mark,13,22,"for false christs and false prophets will arise, and will show signs and wonders, in order to lead astray, if possible, the elect."
Mark,13,23,"But as for you, see! I have told you everything in advance."
Mark,13,24,"“But in those days, after that tribulation, THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT"
Mark,13,25,"AND THE STARS WILL BE FALLING from heaven, AND THE POWERS THAT ARE IN THE HEAVENS will be shaken."
Mark,13,26,And then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN CLOUDS with great power and glory.
Mark,13,27,"And then He will send forth the angels, and will gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest end of heaven."
Mark,13,28,"“Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near."
Mark,13,29,"Even so, you too, when you see these things happening, recognize that He is near, right at the door."
Mark,13,30,"Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place."
Mark,13,31,"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away."
Mark,13,32,"But of that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone."
Mark,13,33,"“See to it, keep on the alert; for you do not know when the appointed time will come."
Mark,13,34,"It is like a man away on a journey, who, leaving his house and giving authority to his slaves—each one his task, also commanded the doorkeeper to stay awake."
Mark,13,35,"Therefore, stay awake—for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, whether in the evening, at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning"
Mark,13,36,lest he come suddenly and find you sleeping.
Mark,13,37,"And what I say to you I say to all, ‘Stay awake!’ ”"
Mark,14,1,"Now the Passover and Unleavened Bread were two days away; and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how, after seizing Him in secret, they might kill Him"
Mark,14,2,"for they were saying, “Not during the festival, lest there be a riot of the people.”"
Mark,14,3,"And while He was in Bethany at the home of Simon the leper, and reclining at the table, there came a woman with an alabaster jar of perfume of very costly pure nard; and she broke the jar and poured it over His head."
Mark,14,4,"But some were indignantly remarking to one another, “Why has this perfume been wasted?"
Mark,14,5,For this perfume might have been sold for over three hundred denarii and given to the poor.” And they were scolding her.
Mark,14,6,"But Jesus said, “Let her alone; why do you bother her? She did a good work to Me."
Mark,14,7,"For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you wish you can do good to them; but you do not always have Me."
Mark,14,8,She has done what she could; she anointed My body beforehand for the burial.
Mark,14,9,"And truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman did will also be spoken of in memory of her.”"
Mark,14,10,"Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests in order to betray Him to them."
Mark,14,11,"And when they heard this, they were glad and promised to give him money. And he began seeking how to betray Him at an opportune time."
Mark,14,12,"And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was being sacrificed, His disciples *said to Him, “Where do You want us to go and prepare for You to eat the Passover?”"
Mark,14,13,"And He *sent two of His disciples and *said to them, “Go into the city, and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him"
Mark,14,14,"and wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is My guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?” ’"
Mark,14,15,And he himself will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; prepare for us there.”
Mark,14,16,"And the disciples went out and came to the city, and found it just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover."
Mark,14,17,And when it was evening He *came with the twelve.
Mark,14,18,"And as they were reclining at the table and eating, Jesus said, “Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me—the one who is eating with Me.”"
Mark,14,19,"They began to be grieved and to say to Him one by one, “Surely not I?”"
Mark,14,20,"And He said to them, “It is one of the twelve, the one who dips with Me in the bowl."
Mark,14,21,For the Son of Man is to go just as it is written of Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.”
Mark,14,22,"And while they were eating, He took some bread, and after a blessing, He broke it, and gave it to them, and said, “Take it; this is My body.”"
Mark,14,23,"And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, and they all drank from it."
Mark,14,24,"And He said to them, “This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many."
Mark,14,25,"Truly I say to you, I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”"
Mark,14,26,"And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives."
Mark,14,27,"And Jesus *said to them, “You will all fall away, because it is written, ‘I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP SHALL BE SCATTERED.’"
Mark,14,28,"But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.”"
Mark,14,29,"But Peter said to Him, “Even though all may fall away, yet I will not.”"
Mark,14,30,"And Jesus *said to him, “Truly I say to you, that today, this very night, before a rooster crows twice, you yourself will deny Me three times.”"
Mark,14,31,"But Peter kept saying insistently, “If I have to die with You, I will not deny You!” And they all were saying the same thing also."
Mark,14,32,"Then they *came to a place named Gethsemane; and He *said to His disciples, “Sit here until I have prayed.”"
Mark,14,33,"And He *took with Him Peter and James and John, and began to be very distressed and troubled."
Mark,14,34,"And He *said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death; remain here and keep watch.”"
Mark,14,35,"And He went a little beyond them, and fell to the ground and began to pray that if it were possible, the hour might pass from Him."
Mark,14,36,"And He was saying, “Abba! Father! All things are possible for You; remove this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what You will.”"
Mark,14,37,"And He *came and *found them sleeping, and *said to Peter, “Simon, are you sleeping? Could you not keep watch for one hour?"
Mark,14,38,"Keep watching and praying that you may not come into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”"
Mark,14,39,"And again He went away and prayed, saying the same words."
Mark,14,40,"And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to answer Him."
Mark,14,41,"And He *came the third time, and *said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough; the hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Mark,14,42,"Get up, let us go; behold, the one who betrays Me is at hand!”"
Mark,14,43,"And immediately while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, *came up, and with him was a crowd with swords and clubs, who were from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders."
Mark,14,44,"Now he who was betraying Him had given them a signal, saying, “Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him and lead Him away under guard.”"
Mark,14,45,"And after coming, Judas, having immediately gone to Him, *said, “Rabbi!” and kissed Him."
Mark,14,46,And they laid hands on Him and seized Him.
Mark,14,47,"But one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear."
Mark,14,48,"And Jesus answered and said to them, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me, as you would against a robber?"
Mark,14,49,"Every day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me; but this has taken place in order that the Scriptures would be fulfilled.”"
Mark,14,50,And they all left Him and fled.
Mark,14,51,"And a young man was following Him, wearing nothing but a linen sheet over his naked body; and they *seized him."
Mark,14,52,But he pulled free of the linen sheet and escaped naked.
Mark,14,53,Then they led Jesus away to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes *gathered together.
Mark,14,54,"And Peter followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers and warming himself at the fire."
Mark,14,55,"Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking to obtain testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, and they were not finding any."
Mark,14,56,"For many were giving false testimony against Him, but their testimony was not consistent."
Mark,14,57,"And some, standing up, were giving false testimony against Him, saying"
Mark,14,58,"“We ourselves heard Him say, ‘I will destroy this sanctuary made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.’ ”"
Mark,14,59,And not even in this way was their testimony consistent.
Mark,14,60,"And the high priest stood up in their midst and questioned Jesus, saying, “You answer nothing? What are these men testifying against You?”"
Mark,14,61,"But He kept silent and did not answer. Again the high priest was questioning Him and *said to Him, “Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”"
Mark,14,62,"And Jesus said, “I am; and you shall see THE SON OF MAN SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE POWER, and COMING WITH THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN.”"
Mark,14,63,"And tearing his tunics, the high priest *said, “What further need do we have of witnesses?"
Mark,14,64,You have heard the blasphemy; how does it seem to you?” And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death.
Mark,14,65,"And some began to spit at Him, and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him with their fists, and to say to Him, “Prophesy!” And the officers received Him with slaps in the face."
Mark,14,66,"And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant-girls of the high priest *came"
Mark,14,67,"and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and *said, “You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.”"
Mark,14,68,"But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you are talking about.” And he went out into the entryway."
Mark,14,69,"And when the servant-girl saw him, she began once more to say to the bystanders, “This is one of them!”"
Mark,14,70,"But again he was denying it. And after a little while the bystanders were again saying to Peter, “Surely you are one of them, for you are also a Galilean.”"
Mark,14,71,"But he began to curse and swear, “I do not know this man you are talking about!”"
Mark,14,72,"And immediately a rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said the statement to him, “Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.” And throwing himself down, he began to cry."
Mark,15,1,"And early in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes and the whole Sanhedrin, immediately held council; and binding Jesus, led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate."
Mark,15,2,"And Pilate questioned Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” And He answered him and *said, “You yourself say it.”"
Mark,15,3,And the chief priests began to accuse Him of many things.
Mark,15,4,"Then Pilate was questioning Him again, saying, “You answer nothing? See how many accusations they bring against You!”"
Mark,15,5,But Jesus made no further answer; so Pilate marveled.
Mark,15,6,Now at the feast he used to release for them any one prisoner whom they requested.
Mark,15,7,And the man named Barabbas had been imprisoned with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the insurrection.
Mark,15,8,And the crowd went up and began asking him to do as he had been accustomed to do for them.
Mark,15,9,"And Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?”"
Mark,15,10,For he was aware that the chief priests had delivered Him over because of envy.
Mark,15,11,But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to ask him to release Barabbas for them instead.
Mark,15,12,"And answering again, Pilate was saying to them, “Then what shall I do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?”"
Mark,15,13,"And they shouted again, “Crucify Him!”"
Mark,15,14,"But Pilate was saying to them, “Why? What evil did He do?” But they shouted all the more, “Crucify Him!”"
Mark,15,15,"And wishing to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them, and after having Jesus scourged, he delivered Him over to be crucified."
Mark,15,16,"So the soldiers took Him away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium), and they *called together the whole Roman cohort."
Mark,15,17,"And they *dressed Him up in purple, and after twisting a crown of thorns, they *put it on Him"
Mark,15,18,"and they began to greet Him, “Hail, King of the Jews!”"
Mark,15,19,"And they kept beating His head with a reed, and spitting on Him; and kneeling, they were bowing down before Him."
Mark,15,20,"And after they had mocked Him, they took the purple robe off Him and put His own garments on Him. And they *led Him out to crucify Him."
Mark,15,21,"And they *pressed into service a passer-by coming from the countryside, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), to carry His cross."
Mark,15,22,"Then they *brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull."
Mark,15,23,And they tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He did not take it.
Mark,15,24,"And they *crucified Him, and *divided up His garments among themselves, casting lots for them to decide who should take what."
Mark,15,25,"Now it was the third hour, and they crucified Him."
Mark,15,26,"And the inscription of the charge against Him read, “THE KING OF THE JEWS.”"
Mark,15,27,"And they *crucified two robbers with Him, one on His right and one on His left."
Mark,15,28,"[And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And He was numbered with transgressors.”]"
Mark,15,29,"And those passing by were blaspheming Him, shaking their heads, and saying, “Ha! You who are going to destroy the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days"
Mark,15,30,save Yourself by coming down from the cross!”
Mark,15,31,"In the same way, mocking Him to one another, the chief priests also, along with the scribes, were saying, “He saved others; He cannot save Himself."
Mark,15,32,"Let this Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, so that we may see and believe!” Those who were crucified with Him were also insulting Him."
Mark,15,33,"And when the sixth hour came, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour."
Mark,15,34,"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “ELOI, ELOI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?” which is translated, “MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?”"
Mark,15,35,"And when some of the bystanders heard it, they began saying, “Look, He is calling for Elijah.”"
Mark,15,36,"And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink, saying, “Let us see whether Elijah will come to take Him down.”"
Mark,15,37,"And Jesus, uttering a loud cry, breathed His last."
Mark,15,38,And the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom.
Mark,15,39,"And when the centurion, who was standing right in front of Him, saw the way He breathed His last, he said, “Truly this man was God’s Son!”"
Mark,15,40,"And there were also some women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the Less and Joses, and Salome"
Mark,15,41,"who, when He was in Galilee, were following Him and serving Him; and there were many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem."
Mark,15,42,"And when evening had already come, because it was Preparation day, that is, the day before the Sabbath"
Mark,15,43,"Joseph of Arimathea came, a prominent Council member, who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God; and he gathered up courage and went in before Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus."
Mark,15,44,"And Pilate wondered if He had died by this time, and summoning the centurion, he questioned him as to whether He already died."
Mark,15,45,"And ascertaining this from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph."
Mark,15,46,"And when Joseph had bought a linen cloth and took Him down, he wrapped Him in the linen cloth and laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock. And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb."
Mark,15,47,And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were looking on to see where He had been laid.
Mark,16,1,"And when the Sabbath passed, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, so that they might come and anoint Him."
Mark,16,2,"And very early on the first day of the week, they *came to the tomb when the sun had risen."
Mark,16,3,"And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”"
Mark,16,4,"And looking up, they *saw that the stone had been rolled away, although it was very large."
Mark,16,5,"And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, wearing a white robe; and they were amazed."
Mark,16,6,"And he *said to them, “Do not be amazed; you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen; He is not here; behold, the place where they laid Him."
