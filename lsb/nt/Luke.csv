Luke,1,1,Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us
Luke,1,2,"just as those, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word, handed them down to us"
Luke,1,3,"it seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from the beginning, to write it out for you in orderly sequence, most excellent Theophilus"
Luke,1,4,so that you may know the certainty about the things you have been taught.
Luke,1,5,"In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah, and he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth."
Luke,1,6,"And they were both righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and righteous requirements of the Lord."
Luke,1,7,"But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years."
Luke,1,8,Now it happened that while he was performing his priestly service before God in the order of his division
Luke,1,9,"according to the custom of the priestly office, he was chosen by lot to enter the sanctuary of the Lord and burn incense."
Luke,1,10,And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of the incense offering.
Luke,1,11,"And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the altar of incense."
Luke,1,12,"And Zechariah was troubled when he saw the angel, and fear fell upon him."
Luke,1,13,"But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will call his name John."
Luke,1,14,"And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth."
Luke,1,15,"For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; and HE WILL NOT DRINK ANY WINE OR STRONG DRINK, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit while yet in his mother’s womb."
Luke,1,16,And he will turn many of the sons of Israel back to the Lord their God.
Luke,1,17,"And he will go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, TO TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS BACK TO THE CHILDREN, and the disobedient to the attitude of the righteous, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”"
Luke,1,18,"And Zechariah said to the angel, “How will I know this? For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.”"
Luke,1,19,"And the angel answered and said to him, “I am Gabriel, who stands before God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news."
Luke,1,20,"And behold, you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day when these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.”"
Luke,1,21,"And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and were wondering at his delay in the sanctuary."
Luke,1,22,"But when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. And he kept making signs to them, and remained mute."
Luke,1,23,"And it happened that when the days of his priestly service were fulfilled, he went back home."
Luke,1,24,"After these days Elizabeth his wife conceived, and she kept herself in seclusion for five months, saying"
Luke,1,25,“This is the way the Lord has dealt with me in the days when He looked upon me to take away my disgrace among men.”
Luke,1,26,Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth
Luke,1,27,"to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin’s name was Mary."
Luke,1,28,"And coming in, he said to her, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.”"
Luke,1,29,"But she was very perplexed at this statement, and was pondering what kind of greeting this was."
Luke,1,30,"And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God."
Luke,1,31,"And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus."
Luke,1,32,"He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David"
Luke,1,33,"and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end of His kingdom.”"
Luke,1,34,"But Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin?”"
Luke,1,35,"The angel answered and said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God."
Luke,1,36,"And behold, your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren."
Luke,1,37,For nothing will be impossible with God.”
Luke,1,38,"And Mary said, “Behold, the slave of the Lord; may it be done to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her."
Luke,1,39,"Now at this time Mary arose and went in a hurry to the hill country, to a city of Judah"
Luke,1,40,and entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.
Luke,1,41,"And it happened that when Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit."
Luke,1,42,"And she cried out with a loud voice and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!"
Luke,1,43,"And how has it happened to me, that the mother of my Lord would come to me?"
Luke,1,44,"For behold, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy."
Luke,1,45,And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what had been spoken to her by the Lord.”
Luke,1,46,"And Mary said:
“My soul magnifies the Lord"
Luke,1,47,And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.
Luke,1,48,"“For He has looked upon the humble state of His slave,
For behold, from this time on, all generations will count me blessed."
Luke,1,49,"“For the Mighty One has done great things for me,
And holy is His name."
Luke,1,50,"“AND HIS MERCY IS UPON GENERATION AFTER GENERATION
TOWARD THOSE WHO FEAR HIM."
Luke,1,51,"“He has done a mighty deed with His arm;
He has scattered those who were proud in the thoughts of their heart."
Luke,1,52,"“He has brought down rulers from their thrones,
And has exalted those who were humble."
Luke,1,53,"“HE HAS FILLED THE HUNGRY WITH GOOD THINGS,
And sent away the rich empty-handed."
Luke,1,54,"“He has given help to Israel His servant,
In remembrance of His mercy"
Luke,1,55,"As He spoke to our fathers,
To Abraham and his seed forever.”"
Luke,1,56,"And Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her home."
Luke,1,57,"Now the time was fulfilled for Elizabeth to give birth, and she gave birth to a son."
Luke,1,58,"And her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified His great mercy toward her, and they were rejoicing with her."
Luke,1,59,"And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to call him Zechariah, after the name of his father."
Luke,1,60,"But his mother answered and said, “No, but he shall be called John.”"
Luke,1,61,"And they said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.”"
Luke,1,62,"And they were making signs to his father, as to what he wanted him called."
Luke,1,63,"And he asked for a tablet and wrote as follows, “His name is John.” And they all marveled."
Luke,1,64,"And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he began to speak, blessing God."
Luke,1,65,"And fear came on all those living around them, and all these matters were being talked about in all the hill country of Judea."
Luke,1,66,"And all who heard these things put them in their heart, saying, “What then will this child be?” For the hand of the Lord was indeed with him."
Luke,1,67,"And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying"
Luke,1,68,"“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,
For He visited and accomplished redemption for His people"
Luke,1,69,"And raised up a horn of salvation for us
In the house of David His servant"
Luke,1,70,As He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from of old
Luke,1,71,"Salvation FROM OUR ENEMIES,
And FROM THE HAND OF ALL WHO HATE US"
Luke,1,72,"To show mercy toward our fathers,
And to remember His holy covenant"
Luke,1,73,The oath which He swore to Abraham our father
Luke,1,74,"To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies,
Might serve Him without fear"
Luke,1,75,In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.
Luke,1,76,"“And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High,
For you will go on BEFORE THE LORD TO MAKE READY HIS WAYS"
Luke,1,77,"To give to His people the knowledge of salvation
By the forgiveness of their sins"
Luke,1,78,"Because of the tender mercy of our God,
With which the Sunrise from on high will visit us"
Luke,1,79,"TO SHINE UPON THOSE WHO SIT IN DARKNESS AND THE SHADOW OF DEATH,
To direct our feet into the way of peace.”"
Luke,1,80,"And the child continued to grow and to become strong in spirit, and he lived in the desolate regions until the day of his public appearance to Israel."
Luke,2,1,Now it happened that in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for a census to be taken of all the inhabited earth.
Luke,2,2,This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.
Luke,2,3,"And everyone was going to be registered for the census, each to his own city."
Luke,2,4,"And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David"
Luke,2,5,"in order to register along with Mary, who was betrothed to him, and was with child."
Luke,2,6,"Now it happened that while they were there, the days were fulfilled for her to give birth."
Luke,2,7,"And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him in cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the guest room."
Luke,2,8,In the same region there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.
Luke,2,9,"And an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened."
Luke,2,10,"But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people."
Luke,2,11,"For today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord."
Luke,2,12,And this will be the sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”
Luke,2,13,And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying
Luke,2,14,"“Glory to God in the highest,
And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased.”"
Luke,2,15,"And it happened that when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds began saying to one another, “Let us go to Bethlehem then, and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us.”"
Luke,2,16,"So they went in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger."
Luke,2,17,"And when they had seen this, they made known the statement which had been told them about this Child."
Luke,2,18,And all who heard it marveled at the things which were told them by the shepherds.
Luke,2,19,"But Mary was treasuring all these things, pondering them in her heart."
Luke,2,20,"And the shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as was told them."
Luke,2,21,"And when eight days were fulfilled so that they could circumcise Him, His name was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb."
Luke,2,22,"And when the days for their cleansing according to the Law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord"
Luke,2,23,"(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “EVERY firstborn MALE THAT OPENS THE WOMB SHALL BE CALLED HOLY TO THE LORD”)"
Luke,2,24,"and to offer a sacrifice according to what was said in the Law of the Lord, “A PAIR OF TURTLEDOVES OR TWO YOUNG PIGEONS.”"
Luke,2,25,"And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the comfort of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him."
Luke,2,26,And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
Luke,2,27,"And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to carry out for Him the custom of the Law"
Luke,2,28,"then he took Him into his arms and blessed God, and said"
Luke,2,29,"“Now Master, You are releasing Your slave in peace,
According to Your word."
Luke,2,30,For my eyes have seen Your salvation
Luke,2,31,Which You prepared in the presence of all peoples
Luke,2,32,"A LIGHT FOR REVELATION TO THE GENTILES,
And for the glory of Your people Israel.”"
Luke,2,33,And His father and mother were marveling at the things which were being said about Him.
Luke,2,34,"And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, “Behold, this Child is appointed for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign to be opposed"
Luke,2,35,and a sword will pierce through your own soul as well—that the thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.”
Luke,2,36,"And there was a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin"
Luke,2,37,"and then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers."
Luke,2,38,"And at that very moment she came up and began giving thanks to God, and continued to speak of Him to all those who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem."
Luke,2,39,"And when they had finished everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth."
Luke,2,40,"Now the Child continued to grow and become strong, being filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him."
Luke,2,41,And His parents would go to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.
Luke,2,42,"And when He became twelve years old, they went up there according to the custom of the Feast"
Luke,2,43,"and as they were returning, after finishing the days of the Feast, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. But His parents did not know."
Luke,2,44,"But supposing Him to be in the caravan, they went a day’s journey, and they began searching for Him among their relatives and acquaintances."
Luke,2,45,"When they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem searching for Him."
Luke,2,46,"And it happened that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions."
Luke,2,47,And all who heard Him were astounded at His understanding and His answers.
Luke,2,48,"When they saw Him, they were astonished, and His mother said to Him, “Child, why have You treated us this way? Behold, Your father and I have been anxiously searching for You.”"
Luke,2,49,"And He said to them, “Why is it that you were searching for Me? Did you not know that I had to be in My Father’s house?”"
Luke,2,50,But they did not understand the statement which He had spoken to them.
Luke,2,51,"And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and He continued in subjection to them, and His mother was treasuring all these things in her heart."
Luke,2,52,"And Jesus was advancing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men."
Luke,3,1,"Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene"
Luke,3,2,"during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness."
Luke,3,3,"And he came into all the district around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins"
Luke,3,4,"as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,
“THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS,
‘MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD,
MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT."
Luke,3,5,"‘EVERY RAVINE WILL BE FILLED,
AND EVERY MOUNTAIN AND HILL WILL BE BROUGHT LOW;
THE CROOKED WILL BE STRAIGHT,
AND THE ROUGH ROADS SMOOTH."
Luke,3,6,AND ALL FLESH WILL SEE THE SALVATION OF GOD.’ ”
Luke,3,7,"So he was saying to the crowds who were going out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Luke,3,8,"Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’ for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham."
Luke,3,9,"But indeed the axe is already laid at the root of the trees; therefore, every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”"
Luke,3,10,"And the crowds were questioning him, saying, “Then what should we do?”"
Luke,3,11,"And he would answer and say to them, “The man who has two tunics is to share with him who has none; and he who has food is to do likewise.”"
Luke,3,12,"And tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher, what should we do?”"
Luke,3,13,"And he said to them, “Collect no more than what you have been ordered to.”"
Luke,3,14,"And soldiers were also questioning him, saying, “What should we also do?” And he said to them, “Do not take money from anyone by force, or extort anyone, and be content with your wages.”"
Luke,3,15,"Now while the people were in a state of expectation and all were reasoning in their hearts about John, as to whether he was the Christ"
Luke,3,16,"John answered, saying to them all, “As for me, I baptize you with water, but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to untie the strap of His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
Luke,3,17,"His winnowing fork is in His hand to thoroughly clear His threshing floor and to gather the wheat into His barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”"
Luke,3,18,So with many other exhortations he proclaimed the gospel to the people.
Luke,3,19,"But when Herod the tetrarch was reproved by him because of Herodias, his brother’s wife, and because of all the wicked things which Herod had done"
Luke,3,20,Herod also added this to them all: he locked John up in prison.
Luke,3,21,"Now it happened that when all the people were being baptized, Jesus was also baptized, and while He was praying, heaven was opened"
Luke,3,22,"and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice came out of heaven, “You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased.”"
Luke,3,23,"When He began His ministry, Jesus Himself was about thirty years of age, being, as was supposed,
the son of Joseph,
the son of Eli"
Luke,3,24,"the son of Matthat,
the son of Levi,

Luke,4,1,"Now Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was being led around by the Spirit in the wilderness"
Luke,4,2,"for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And He ate nothing during those days, and when they had finished, He was hungry."
Luke,4,3,"And the devil said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.”"
Luke,4,4,"And Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE.’ ”"
Luke,4,5,And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
Luke,4,6,"And the devil said to Him, “I will give You all this dominion and its glory, for it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish."
Luke,4,7,"Therefore if You worship before me, it shall all be Yours.”"
Luke,4,8,"And Jesus answered and said to him, “It is written, ‘YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD AND SERVE HIM ONLY.’ ”"
Luke,4,9,"And he led Him to Jerusalem and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here"
Luke,4,10,"for it is written,
‘HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CONCERNING YOU TO GUARD YOU,’"
Luke,4,11,"and,
‘ON their HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP,
LEST YOU STRIKE YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE.’ ”"
Luke,4,12,"And Jesus answered and said to him, “It is said, ‘YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST.’ ”"
Luke,4,13,"And when the devil had finished every temptation, he left Him until an opportune time."
Luke,4,14,"And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about Him spread through all the surrounding district."
Luke,4,15,"And He was teaching in their synagogues, being glorified by all."
Luke,4,16,"And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up, and as was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read."
Luke,4,17,And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. And He opened the scroll and found the place where it was written
Luke,4,18,"“THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME,
BECAUSE HE ANOINTED ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR.
HE HAS SENT ME TO PROCLAIM RELEASE TO THE CAPTIVES,
AND RECOVERY OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND,
TO SET FREE THOSE WHO ARE OPPRESSED"
Luke,4,19,TO PROCLAIM THE FAVORABLE YEAR OF THE LORD.”
Luke,4,20,"And He closed the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down, and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him."
Luke,4,21,"And He began to say to them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”"
Luke,4,22,"And all were speaking well of Him and marveling at the gracious words which were coming forth from His lips, and they were saying, “Is this not Joseph’s son?”"
Luke,4,23,"And He said to them, “No doubt you will quote this proverb to Me, ‘Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we heard took place at Capernaum, do also here in your hometown as well.’ ”"
Luke,4,24,"And He said, “Truly I say to you, no prophet is welcome in his hometown."
Luke,4,25,"But I say to you in truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land"
Luke,4,26,"and yet Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow."
Luke,4,27,"And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.”"
Luke,4,28,And all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage as they heard these things
Luke,4,29,"and they stood up and drove Him out of the city, and led Him to the edge of the hill on which their city had been built, in order to throw Him down the cliff."
Luke,4,30,"But passing through their midst, He went on His way."
Luke,4,31,"And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching them on the Sabbath"
Luke,4,32,"and they were amazed at His teaching, for His message was with authority."
Luke,4,33,"And in the synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice"
Luke,4,34,"“Let us alone! What do we have to do with You, Jesus the Nazarene? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”"
Luke,4,35,"But Jesus rebuked it, saying, “Be quiet and come out of him!” And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst of the people, it came out of him without doing him any harm."
Luke,4,36,"And amazement came upon them all, and they were talking with one another saying, “What is this message? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits and they come out.”"
Luke,4,37,And the report about Him was spreading into every place in the surrounding district.
Luke,4,38,"Then He stood up and left the synagogue, and entered Simon’s home. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Him to help her."
Luke,4,39,"And standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her. Immediately she stood up and began waiting on them."
Luke,4,40,"And while the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to Him, and laying His hands on each one of them, He was healing them."
Luke,4,41,"And demons also were coming out of many, shouting and saying, “You are the Son of God!” But rebuking them, He was not allowing them to speak, because they knew Him to be the Christ."
Luke,4,42,"When day came, Jesus left and went to a secluded place; and the crowds were eagerly seeking for Him, and came to Him and tried to keep Him from going away from them."
Luke,4,43,"But He said to them, “I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also, for I was sent for this purpose.”"
Luke,4,44,So He kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
Luke,5,1,"Now it happened that while the crowd was pressing around Him and listening to the word of God, He was standing at the edge of the lake of Gennesaret"
Luke,5,2,"and He saw two boats lying at the edge of the lake, and the fishermen, having gotten out of them, were washing their nets."
Luke,5,3,"And He got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little way from the land. And He sat down and began teaching the crowds from the boat."
Luke,5,4,"And when He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, “Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.”"
Luke,5,5,"Simon answered and said, “Master, we labored all night and caught nothing, but at Your word, I will let down the nets.”"
Luke,5,6,"And when they had done this, they enclosed a great quantity of fish. And their nets began to break"
Luke,5,7,"so they signaled to their partners in the other boat for them to come and help them. And they came and filled both of the boats, so that they began to sink."
Luke,5,8,"But when Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Go away from me Lord, for I am a sinful man!”"
Luke,5,9,For amazement had seized him and all his companions because of the catch of fish which they had taken
Luke,5,10,"and James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon, were also likewise amazed. And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not fear, from now on you will be catching men.”"
Luke,5,11,"And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed Him."
Luke,5,12,"And it happened that while He was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man covered with leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”"
Luke,5,13,"And He stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing; be cleansed.” And immediately the leprosy left him."
Luke,5,14,"And He directed him to tell no one, “But go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing, just as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”"
Luke,5,15,"But the news about Him was spreading even farther, and large crowds were gathering to hear Him and to be healed of their sicknesses."
Luke,5,16,But He Himself would often slip away to the desolate regions and pray.
Luke,5,17,"And it happened that one day He was teaching; and there were some Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem, and the power of the Lord was present for Him to perform healing."
Luke,5,18,"And behold, some men were carrying on a stretcher a man who was paralyzed; and they were trying to bring him in and to set him down before Him."
Luke,5,19,"But not finding any way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiles with his stretcher, into the middle of the crowd, in front of Jesus."
Luke,5,20,"And seeing their faith, He said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven you.”"
Luke,5,21,"The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?”"
Luke,5,22,"But Jesus, knowing their reasonings, answered and said to them, “Why are you reasoning in your hearts?"
Luke,5,23,"Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins have been forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?"
Luke,5,24,"But, so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,”—He said to the paralytic—“I say to you, get up, and, picking up your stretcher, go home.”"
Luke,5,25,"And immediately he rose up before them, and picked up what he had been lying on, and went home glorifying God."
Luke,5,26,"And astonishment seized them all and they began glorifying God; and they were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen remarkable things today.”"
Luke,5,27,"And after that He went out and noticed a tax collector named Levi sitting in the tax office, and He said to him, “Follow Me.”"
Luke,5,28,"And he left everything behind, and rose up and began to follow Him."
Luke,5,29,And Levi gave a big reception for Him in his house; and there was a great crowd of tax collectors and other people who were reclining at the table with them.
Luke,5,30,"And the Pharisees and their scribes began grumbling at His disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?”"
Luke,5,31,"And Jesus answered and said to them, “It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick."
Luke,5,32,I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.”
Luke,5,33,"And they said to Him, “The disciples of John often fast and offer prayers, the disciples of the Pharisees also do likewise, but Yours eat and drink.”"
Luke,5,34,"And Jesus said to them, “Can you make the attendants of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them?"
Luke,5,35,"But the days will come; and when the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will fast in those days.”"
Luke,5,36,And He was also telling them a parable: “No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and puts it on an old garment; otherwise he will both tear the new and the piece from the new will not match the old.
Luke,5,37,"And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled out, and the skins will be ruined."
Luke,5,38,But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.
Luke,5,39,"And no one, after drinking old wine wishes for new; for he says, ‘The old is good enough.’ ”"
Luke,6,1,"Now it happened that on a Sabbath He was passing through some grainfields, and His disciples were picking and eating the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands."
Luke,6,2,"But some of the Pharisees said, “Why do you do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”"
Luke,6,3,"And Jesus answered and said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him"
Luke,6,4,"how he entered the house of God, and took and ate the consecrated bread which is not lawful for any to eat except the priests alone, and gave it to his companions?”"
Luke,6,5,"And He was saying to them, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”"
Luke,6,6,Now it happened that on another Sabbath He entered the synagogue and was teaching; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered.
Luke,6,7,"And the scribes and the Pharisees were watching Him closely to see if He heals on the Sabbath, so that they might find reason to accuse Him."
Luke,6,8,"But He knew what they were thinking, and He said to the man with the withered hand, “Get up and come forward!” And he stood up and came forward."
Luke,6,9,"And Jesus said to them, “I ask you, is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to destroy it?”"
Luke,6,10,"And after looking around at them all, He said to him, “Stretch out your hand!” And he did so, and his hand was restored."
Luke,6,11,"But they themselves were filled with rage, and were discussing together what they might do to Jesus."
Luke,6,12,"Now it happened that at this time He went off to the mountain to pray, and He was spending the whole night in prayer to God."
Luke,6,13,"And when day came, He called His disciples to Him and chose twelve of them, whom He also named as apostles"
Luke,6,14,"Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James and John; and Philip and Bartholomew"
Luke,6,15,"and Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot"
Luke,6,16,"Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor."
Luke,6,17,"And Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place; and there was a large crowd of His disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon"
Luke,6,18,who had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were being cured.
Luke,6,19,"And all the crowd was trying to touch Him, for power was coming from Him and healing them all."
Luke,6,20,"And turning His gaze toward His disciples, He began to say,
“Blessed are the poor, for yours is the kingdom of God."
Luke,6,21,"Blessed are those who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied.
Blessed are those who cry now, for you shall laugh."
Luke,6,22,"Blessed are you when men hate you, and exclude you, and insult you, and scorn your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of Man."
Luke,6,23,"Be glad in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For their fathers were doing the same things to the prophets."
Luke,6,24,"But woe to you who are rich, for you are receiving your comfort in full."
Luke,6,25,"Woe to you who are well-fed now, for you shall be hungry.
Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and cry."
Luke,6,26,"Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for their fathers were doing the same things to the false prophets."
Luke,6,27,"“But I say to you who hear, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you"
Luke,6,28,"bless those who curse you, pray for those who disparage you."
Luke,6,29,"Whoever hits you on the cheek, offer him the other also; and whoever takes away your garment, do not withhold your tunic from him either."
Luke,6,30,"Give to everyone who asks of you, and whoever takes away what is yours, do not demand it back."
Luke,6,31,And treat others the same way you want them to treat you.
Luke,6,32,"And if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them."
Luke,6,33,"And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same."
Luke,6,34,"And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same amount."
Luke,6,35,"But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He Himself is kind to the ungrateful and evil."
Luke,6,36,"Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful."
Luke,6,37,"“And do not judge, and you will not be judged; and do not condemn, and you will not be condemned; pardon, and you will be pardoned."
Luke,6,38,"Give, and it will be given to you. They will pour into your lap a good measure—pressed down, shaken together, running over. For by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return.”"
Luke,6,39,And He also spoke a parable to them: “Can a blind man guide a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?
Luke,6,40,"A student is not above his teacher; but everyone, after he has been fully trained, will be like his teacher."
Luke,6,41,"And why do you look at the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?"
Luke,6,42,"How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,’ when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother’s eye."
Luke,6,43,"For there is no good tree which produces bad fruit, nor, on the other hand, a bad tree which produces good fruit."
Luke,6,44,"For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a bramble bush."
Luke,6,45,The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil. For his mouth speaks from the abundance of his heart.
Luke,6,46,"“Now why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?"
Luke,6,47,"Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and does them, I will show you whom he is like"
Luke,6,48,"he is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock; and when a flood occurred, the river burst against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built."
Luke,6,49,"But the one who heard and did not do accordingly, is like a man who built a house on the ground without any foundation; and the river burst against it and immediately it collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.”"
Luke,7,1,"When He had completed all His words in the hearing of the people, He went to Capernaum."
Luke,7,2,"And a centurion’s slave, who was highly regarded by him, was sick and about to die."
Luke,7,3,"Now when he heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders asking Him to come and save the life of his slave."
Luke,7,4,"And when they came to Jesus, they were earnestly pleading with Him, saying, “He is worthy for You to grant this to him"
Luke,7,5,for he loves our nation and it was he who built us our synagogue.”
Luke,7,6,"Now Jesus was going on His way with them; and when He was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to Him, “Lord, do not trouble Yourself further, for I am not good enough for You to come under my roof."
Luke,7,7,"For this reason I did not even consider myself worthy to come to You, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
Luke,7,8,"For I also am a man placed under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”"
Luke,7,9,"Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled at him. And He turned to the crowd that was following Him and said, “I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.”"
Luke,7,10,"And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health."
Luke,7,11,"And it happened that soon afterwards He went to a city called Nain, and His disciples were going along with Him, accompanied by a large crowd."
Luke,7,12,"Now as He approached the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a sizeable crowd from the city was with her."
Luke,7,13,"And when the Lord saw her, He felt compassion for her and said to her, “Do not cry.”"
Luke,7,14,"And He came up and touched the coffin, and the bearers came to a halt. And He said, “Young man, I say to you, arise!”"
Luke,7,15,And the dead man sat up and began to speak. And Jesus gave him back to his mother.
Luke,7,16,"And fear gripped them all, and they began glorifying God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!” and, “God has visited His people!”"
Luke,7,17,And this report concerning Him went out all over Judea and in all the surrounding district.
Luke,7,18,And the disciples of John reported to him about all these things.
Luke,7,19,"Summoning two of his disciples, John sent them to the Lord, saying, “Are You the One who is to come, or should we look for someone else?”"
Luke,7,20,"When the men came to Him, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying, ‘Are You the One who is to come, or should we look for someone else?’ ”"
Luke,7,21,"At that very time He cured many people of diseases and afflictions and evil spirits, and He granted sight to many who were blind."
Luke,7,22,"And He answered and said to them, “Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: the BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM."
Luke,7,23,Blessed is he who does not take offense at Me.”
Luke,7,24,"And when the messengers of John had left, He began to speak to the crowds about John, “What did you go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed shaken by the wind?"
Luke,7,25,"But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft garments? Behold, those who are splendidly clothed and live in luxury are found in royal palaces!"
Luke,7,26,"But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and even more than a prophet."
Luke,7,27,"This is the one about whom it is written,
‘BEHOLD, I SEND MY MESSENGER AHEAD OF YOU,
WHO WILL PREPARE YOUR WAY BEFORE YOU.’"
Luke,7,28,"I say to you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”"
Luke,7,29,"And when all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they acknowledged God’s justice, having been baptized with the baptism of John."
Luke,7,30,"But the Pharisees and the scholars of the Law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, not having been baptized by John."
Luke,7,31,"“To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like?"
Luke,7,32,"They are like children, sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, who say, ‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.’"
Luke,7,33,"For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon!’"
Luke,7,34,"The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’"
Luke,7,35,Yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children.”
Luke,7,36,"Now one of the Pharisees was asking Him to eat with him, and He entered the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table."
Luke,7,37,"And behold, there was a woman in the city who was a sinner. And when she learned that He was reclining at the table in the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume."
Luke,7,38,"And standing behind Him at His feet, crying, she began to wet His feet with her tears. And she kept wiping them with the hair of her head, and kissing His feet and anointing them with the perfume."
Luke,7,39,"Now when the Pharisee, who had invited Him, saw this, he said to himself, saying, “If this man were a prophet He would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching Him, that she is a sinner.”"
Luke,7,40,"And Jesus answered and said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” And he replied, “Say it, Teacher.”"
Luke,7,41,"“A moneylender had two debtors: one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty."
Luke,7,42,"When they were unable to repay, he graciously forgave them both. So which of them will love him more?”"
Luke,7,43,"Simon answered and said, “I suppose the one whom he graciously forgave more.” And He said to him, “You have judged correctly.”"
Luke,7,44,"And turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair."
Luke,7,45,"You gave Me no kiss; but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss My feet."
Luke,7,46,"You did not anoint My head with oil, but she anointed My feet with perfume."
Luke,7,47,"For this reason I say to you, her sins, which are many, have been forgiven, for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.”"
Luke,7,48,"Then He said to her, “Your sins have been forgiven.”"
Luke,7,49,"And those who were reclining at the table with Him began to say to themselves, “Who is this man who even forgives sins?”"
Luke,7,50,"And He said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”"
Luke,8,1,"And it happened that soon afterward He was going around from one city and village to another, preaching and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve were with Him"
Luke,8,2,"and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out"
Luke,8,3,"and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s manager, and Susanna, and many others who were ministering to them from their possessions."
Luke,8,4,"Now when a large crowd was coming together, and those from the various cities were journeying to Him, He spoke by way of a parable"
Luke,8,5,"“The sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell beside the road, and it was trampled under foot and the birds of the air ate it up."
Luke,8,6,"And other seed fell on rock and as soon as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture."
Luke,8,7,"And other seed fell among the thorns, and when the thorns grew up with it, they choked it out."
Luke,8,8,"And other seed fell into the good soil; and growing up, it produced a crop one hundred times as great.” As He said these things, He would call out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”"
Luke,8,9,And His disciples began questioning Him as to what this parable meant.
Luke,8,10,"And He said, “To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest it is in parables, so that SEEING THEY MAY NOT SEE, AND HEARING THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND."
Luke,8,11,“Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God.
Luke,8,12,"And those beside the road are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they will not believe and be saved."
Luke,8,13,"And those on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy, and these have no root; they believe for a while, and in time of temptation fall away."
Luke,8,14,"And the seed which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with worries and riches and pleasures of life, and do not bear ripe fruit."
Luke,8,15,"But the seed in the good soil, these are the ones who have heard the word in an honest and good heart, and hold it fast, and bear fruit with perseverance."
Luke,8,16,"“Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it with a container or puts it under a bed, but he puts it on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light."
Luke,8,17,"For nothing is hidden that will not become evident, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light."
Luke,8,18,"So beware how you listen, for whoever has, to him more shall be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him.”"
Luke,8,19,"And His mother and brothers came to Him, and they were unable to get to Him because of the crowd."
Luke,8,20,"And it was reported to Him, “Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, wishing to see You.”"
Luke,8,21,"But He answered and said to them, “My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.”"
Luke,8,22,"Now it happened that on one of those days He and His disciples got into a boat, and He said to them, “Let us go over to the other side of the lake.” So they set sail."
Luke,8,23,"But as they were sailing along, He fell asleep, and a windstorm descended on the lake, and they began to be swamped and in danger."
Luke,8,24,"And they came to Him and woke Him up, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” And He woke up and rebuked the wind and the surging waves, and they stopped, and it became calm."
Luke,8,25,"And He said to them, “Where is your faith?” They were fearful and marveled, saying to one another, “Who then is this, that He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him?”"
Luke,8,26,"Then they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee."
Luke,8,27,"And when He came out onto the land, a man from the city met Him, one who was possessed with demons and had not put on any garment for a long time, and was not living in a house, but in the tombs."
Luke,8,28,"Now seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell before Him, and said in a loud voice, “What do I have to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me.”"
Luke,8,29,"For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had seized him many times, and he was bound with chains and shackles, being kept under guard. And yet breaking his bonds, he was driven by the demon into the desolate regions."
Luke,8,30,"And Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered him."
Luke,8,31,And they were pleading with Him not to command them to go away into the abyss.
Luke,8,32,"Now there was a herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain, and the demons pleaded with Him to permit them to enter the swine. And He gave them permission."
Luke,8,33,"And when the demons came out of the man, they entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned."
Luke,8,34,"And when the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran away and reported it in the city and in the countryside."
Luke,8,35,"And the people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting down at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid."
Luke,8,36,And those who had seen it reported to them how the man who was demon-possessed had been saved.
Luke,8,37,"And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes and the surrounding district asked Him to leave them, for they were gripped with great fear. And He got into a boat and returned."
Luke,8,38,"But the man from whom the demons had gone out was begging Him that he might accompany Him. But He sent him away, saying"
Luke,8,39,"“Return to your house and recount what great things God has done for you.” So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him."
Luke,8,40,"And as Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed Him, for they had all been waiting for Him."
Luke,8,41,"And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was an official of the synagogue. And falling at Jesus’ feet, he began to plead with Him to come to his house"
Luke,8,42,"for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. But as He went, the crowds were pressing against Him."
Luke,8,43,"And a woman who had a hemorrhage for twelve years, and could not be healed by anyone"
Luke,8,44,"came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His garment, and immediately her hemorrhage stopped."
Luke,8,45,"And Jesus said, “Who is the one who touched Me?” And while they were all denying it, Peter said, “Master, the crowds are surrounding and pressing in on You.”"
Luke,8,46,"But Jesus said, “Someone did touch Me, for I knew that power had gone out of Me.”"
Luke,8,47,"And when the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling. And falling down before Him, she declared in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched Him and how she had been immediately healed."
Luke,8,48,"And He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has saved you; go in peace.”"
Luke,8,49,"While He was still speaking, someone *came from the house of the synagogue official, saying, “Your daughter has died; do not trouble the Teacher anymore.”"
Luke,8,50,"But when Jesus heard this, He answered him, “Do not be afraid any longer; only believe, and she will be saved.”"
Luke,8,51,"So when He came to the house, He did not allow anyone to enter with Him, except Peter and John and James, and the girl’s father and mother."
Luke,8,52,"Now they were all crying and lamenting for her, but He said, “Stop crying, for she has not died, but is asleep.”"
Luke,8,53,"And they began laughing at Him, knowing that she had died."
Luke,8,54,"He, however, took her by the hand and called, saying, “Child, arise!”"
Luke,8,55,"And her spirit returned, and she stood up immediately. And He gave orders for something to be given her to eat."
Luke,8,56,"And her parents were astounded, but He directed them to tell no one what had happened."
Luke,9,1,"And calling the twelve together, He gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases."
Luke,9,2,And He sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
Luke,9,3,"And He said to them, “Take nothing for your journey, neither a staff, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money; nor have two tunics apiece."
Luke,9,4,"And whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that city."
Luke,9,5,"And as for those who do not receive you, as you go out from that city, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”"
Luke,9,6,"And departing, they were going throughout the villages, proclaiming the gospel and healing everywhere."
Luke,9,7,"Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was happening, and he was greatly perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead"
Luke,9,8,"and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen again."
Luke,9,9,"And Herod said, “I myself had John beheaded, but who is this man about whom I hear such things?” And he kept trying to see Him."
Luke,9,10,"And when the apostles returned, they recounted to Him all that they had done. Taking them with Him, He slipped away by Himself to a city called Bethsaida."
Luke,9,11,"But when the crowds became aware of this, they followed Him; and welcoming them, He began speaking to them about the kingdom of God and curing those who had need of healing."
Luke,9,12,"Now the day was ending, and the twelve came and said to Him, “Send the crowd away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and obtain lodging and find provisions, for here we are in a desolate place.”"
Luke,9,13,"But He said to them, “You give them something to eat!” And they said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people.”"
Luke,9,14,"(For there were about five thousand men.) And He said to His disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”"
Luke,9,15,"And they did so, and had them all sit down."
Luke,9,16,"Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed them. And He broke them and kept giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd."
Luke,9,17,"And they all ate and were satisfied; and the broken pieces which they had left over were picked up, twelve baskets full."
Luke,9,18,"And it happened that while He was praying alone, the disciples were with Him, and He questioned them, saying, “Who do the crowds say that I am?”"
Luke,9,19,"And they answered and said, “John the Baptist, and others say Elijah, but others, that one of the prophets of old has risen again.”"
Luke,9,20,"And He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” And Peter answered and said, “The Christ of God.”"
Luke,9,21,But He warned them and directed them not to tell this to anyone
Luke,9,22,"saying, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed and be raised up on the third day.”"
Luke,9,23,"And He was saying to them all, “If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow Me."
Luke,9,24,"For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake, he is the one who will save it."
Luke,9,25,"For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits himself?"
Luke,9,26,"For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory, and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels."
Luke,9,27,"But I say to you truthfully, there are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.”"
Luke,9,28,"Now it happened some eight days after these words, that taking along Peter and John and James, He went up on the mountain to pray."
Luke,9,29,"And it happened that while He was praying, the appearance of His face became different, and His clothing became white and gleaming."
Luke,9,30,"And behold, two men were talking with Him, and they were Moses and Elijah"
Luke,9,31,"who, appearing in glory, were speaking of His departure which He was about to fulfill at Jerusalem."
Luke,9,32,"Now Peter and his companions had been overcome with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men standing with Him."
Luke,9,33,"And it happened that as they were leaving Him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three booths: one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah”—not realizing what he was saying."
Luke,9,34,"While he was saying this, a cloud formed and began to overshadow them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud."
Luke,9,35,"Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, My Chosen One; listen to Him!”"
Luke,9,36,"And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent, and reported to no one in those days any of the things which they had seen."
Luke,9,37,"Now it happened on the next day, that when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Him."
Luke,9,38,"And behold, a man from the crowd shouted, saying, “Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, for he is my only one"
Luke,9,39,"and behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly screams, and it throws him into a convulsion with foaming at the mouth, and only with difficulty does it leave him, mauling him as it leaves."
Luke,9,40,"And I begged Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not.”"
Luke,9,41,"And Jesus answered and said, “You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.”"
Luke,9,42,"Now while he was still approaching, the demon slammed him to the ground and threw him into a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father."
Luke,9,43,"And they were all astonished at the majesty of God.
B ut while everyone was marveling at all that He was doing, He said to His disciples"
Luke,9,44,“Put these words into your ears; for the Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.”
Luke,9,45,"But they did not understand this statement, and it was concealed from them so that they would not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask Him about this statement."
Luke,9,46,Now an argument started among them as to which of them might be the greatest.
Luke,9,47,"But Jesus, knowing what they were thinking in their heart, took a child and stood him by His side"
Luke,9,48,"and said to them, “Whoever receives this child in My name receives Me, and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me; for the one who is least among all of you, this is the one who is great.”"
Luke,9,49,"And John answered and said, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we tried to hinder him because he does not follow along with us.”"
Luke,9,50,"But Jesus said to him, “Do not hinder him, for he who is not against you is for you.”"
Luke,9,51,"Now it happened that when the days for Him to be taken up were soon to be fulfilled, He set His face to go to Jerusalem"
Luke,9,52,"and He sent messengers on ahead of Him, and they went and entered a village of the Samaritans to make arrangements for Him."
Luke,9,53,"But they did not receive Him, because He was journeying with His face toward Jerusalem."
Luke,9,54,"And when His disciples James and John saw this, they said, “Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?”"
Luke,9,55,"But He turned and rebuked them, [and said, “You do not know what kind of spirit you are of"
Luke,9,56,"for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.”] And they went on to another village."
Luke,9,57,"And as they were going along the road, someone said to Him, “I will follow You wherever You go.”"
Luke,9,58,"And Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.”"
Luke,9,59,"And He said to another, “Follow Me.” But he said, “Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.”"
Luke,9,60,"But He said to him, “Allow the dead to bury their own dead; but as for you, go and proclaim everywhere the kingdom of God.”"
Luke,9,61,"Another also said, “I will follow You, Lord, but first permit me to say farewell to those at home.”"
Luke,9,62,"But Jesus said to him, “No one, after putting his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.”"
Luke,10,1,"Now after this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them in pairs ahead of Him to every city and place where He Himself was going to come."
Luke,10,2,"And He was saying to them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest."
Luke,10,3,"Go! Behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves."
Luke,10,4,"Carry no money belt, no bag, no sandals, and greet no one on the way."
Luke,10,5,"Whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace be to this house.’"
Luke,10,6,"And if a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him, but if not, it will return to you."
Luke,10,7,"Stay in that house, eating and drinking what they give you; for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not keep moving from house to house."
Luke,10,8,"And whatever city you enter and they receive you, eat what is set before you"
Luke,10,9,"and heal those in it who are sick, and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’"
Luke,10,10,"But in whatever city you enter and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say"
Luke,10,11,"‘Even the dust of your city which clings to our feet we wipe off against you; yet know this, that the kingdom of God is at hand.’"
Luke,10,12,"I say to you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city."
Luke,10,13,"“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had been performed in Tyre and Sidon which occurred in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
Luke,10,14,But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
Luke,10,15,"And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades!"
Luke,10,16,"“The one who listens to you listens to Me, and the one who rejects you rejects Me. And he who rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me.”"
Luke,10,17,"Now the seventy returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name.”"
Luke,10,18,"And He said to them, “I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning."
Luke,10,19,"Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will injure you."
Luke,10,20,"Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven.”"
Luke,10,21,"At that very time He rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit, and said, “I praise You, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight."
Luke,10,22,"All things have been handed over to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.”"
Luke,10,23,"And turning to the disciples, He said privately, “Blessed are the eyes which see the things you see"
Luke,10,24,"for I say to you, that many prophets and kings wished to see the things which you see, and did not see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and did not hear them.”"
Luke,10,25,"And behold, a scholar of the Law stood up and was putting Him to the test, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”"
Luke,10,26,"And He said to him, “What is written in the Law? How do you read it?”"
Luke,10,27,"And he answered and said, “YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND; AND YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.”"
Luke,10,28,"And He said to him, “You have answered correctly; DO THIS AND YOU WILL LIVE.”"
Luke,10,29,"But wishing to justify himself, he said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”"
Luke,10,30,"Jesus replied and said, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, and they stripped him and beat him, and went away leaving him half dead."
Luke,10,31,"And a priest happened to be going down on that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side."
Luke,10,32,"Likewise a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side."
Luke,10,33,"But a Samaritan, who was on a journey, came upon him, and when he saw him, he felt compassion."
Luke,10,34,"And he came to him and bandaged up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them, and he put him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn and took care of him."
Luke,10,35,"And on the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, ‘Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, when I return I will repay you.’"
Luke,10,36,Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the robbers’ hands?”
Luke,10,37,"And he said, “The one who showed mercy toward him.” Then Jesus said to him, “Go and do the same.”"
Luke,10,38,"Now as they were traveling along, He entered a village; and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home."
Luke,10,39,"And she had a sister called Mary, who was also seated at the Lord’s feet, listening to His word."
Luke,10,40,"But Martha was distracted with all her preparations; and she came up to Him and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to do all the preparations alone? Then tell her to help me.”"
Luke,10,41,"But the Lord answered and said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and bothered about so many things"
Luke,10,42,"but only one thing is necessary, for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.”"
Luke,11,1,"And it happened that while Jesus was praying in a certain place, after He had finished, one of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, teach us to pray just as John also taught his disciples.”"
Luke,11,2,"And He said to them, “When you pray, say:
‘ Father, hallowed be Your name.
Your kingdom come."
Luke,11,3,‘Give us each day our daily bread.
Luke,11,4,"‘And forgive us our sins,
For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.
And lead us not into temptation.’ ”"
Luke,11,5,"Then He said to them, “Which of you has a friend and will go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves"
Luke,11,6,"for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him’"
Luke,11,7,"and from inside he answers and says, ‘Do not bother me; the door has already been shut and my children and I are in bed; I cannot rise up and give you anything.’"
Luke,11,8,"I tell you, even though he will not arise and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs."
Luke,11,9,"“So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."
Luke,11,10,"For everyone who asks, receives; and he who seeks, finds; and to him who knocks, it will be opened."
Luke,11,11,"But what father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead of a fish?"
Luke,11,12,"Or, if his son asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?"
Luke,11,13,"If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?”"
Luke,11,14,"And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. Now it happened that when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke, and the crowds marveled."
Luke,11,15,"But some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.”"
Luke,11,16,"And others, testing Him, were seeking from Him a sign from heaven."
Luke,11,17,"But He knew their thoughts and said to them, “Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a house divided against itself falls."
Luke,11,18,"But if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul."
Luke,11,19,"And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? For this reason, they will be your judges."
Luke,11,20,"But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you."
Luke,11,21,"When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are undisturbed."
Luke,11,22,"But when someone stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him, he takes away from him all his armor on which he had relied and distributes his plunder."
Luke,11,23,"He who is not with Me is against Me and he who does not gather with Me, scatters."
Luke,11,24,"“When the unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and not finding any, it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’"
Luke,11,25,"And when it comes, it finds it swept and put in order."
Luke,11,26,"Then it goes and takes along seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there, and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.”"
Luke,11,27,"Now it happened that while Jesus was saying these things, one of the women in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, “Blessed is the womb that bore You and the breasts at which You nursed.”"
Luke,11,28,"But He said, “On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it.”"
Luke,11,29,"Now as the crowds were increasing, He began to say, “This generation is a wicked generation; it seeks a sign, and yet no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah."
Luke,11,30,"For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of Man be to this generation."
Luke,11,31,"The Queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, something greater than Solomon is here."
Luke,11,32,"The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And behold, something greater than Jonah is here."
Luke,11,33,"“No one, after lighting a lamp, puts it away in a cellar nor under a basket, but on the lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light."
Luke,11,34,"The eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye is clear, your whole body also is full of light, but when it is bad, your body also is full of darkness."
Luke,11,35,Therefore watch out that the light in you is not darkness.
Luke,11,36,"If therefore your whole body is full of light, with no dark part in it, it will be wholly illumined, as when the lamp illumines you with its rays.”"
Luke,11,37,"Now when He had spoken, a Pharisee *asked Him to have a meal with him. And He went in and reclined at the table."
Luke,11,38,"But when the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that He had not first ceremonially washed before the meal."
Luke,11,39,"But the Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but inside of you, you are full of robbery and wickedness."
Luke,11,40,"You foolish ones, did not He who made the outside make the inside also?"
Luke,11,41,"But give that which is within as charity, and then all things are clean for you."
Luke,11,42,"“But woe to you Pharisees! For you pay tithe of mint and rue and every kind of garden herb, and yet disregard justice and the love of God, but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others."
Luke,11,43,Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seat in the synagogues and the respectful greetings in the marketplaces.
Luke,11,44,"Woe to you! For you are like concealed tombs, and the people who walk over them are unaware of it.”"
Luke,11,45,"Now one of the scholars of the Law answered and said to Him, “Teacher, when You say these things, You insult us too.”"
Luke,11,46,"But He said, “Woe to you scholars of the Law as well! For you weigh men down with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers."
Luke,11,47,"Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, but your fathers killed them."
Luke,11,48,"So you are witnesses and approve the deeds of your fathers; because it was they who killed them, and you build their tombs."
Luke,11,49,"For this reason also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and some they will persecute"
Luke,11,50,"so that the blood of all the prophets, shed since the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation"
Luke,11,51,"from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the house of God; yes, I tell you, it shall be charged against this generation.’"
Luke,11,52,"Woe to you, scholars of the Law! For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you yourselves did not enter, and you hindered those who were entering.”"
Luke,11,53,"And when He left there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very hostile and to question Him closely on many subjects"
Luke,11,54,plotting to catch Him in something He might say.
Luke,12,1,"At this time, after so many thousands of the crowd had gathered together that they were trampling on one another, He began saying to His disciples first, “Be on your guard for the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."
Luke,12,2,"But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known."
Luke,12,3,"Accordingly, whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops."
Luke,12,4,"“But I say to you, My friends, do not fear those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do."
Luke,12,5,"But I will show you whom to fear: fear the One who, after He has killed, has authority to cast into hell; yes, I tell you, fear Him!"
Luke,12,6,Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God.
Luke,12,7,"Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows."
Luke,12,8,"“And I say to you, everyone who confesses Me before men, the Son of Man will confess him also before the angels of God"
Luke,12,9,but he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God.
Luke,12,10,"And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him, but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him."
Luke,12,11,"Now when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not worry about how or what you are to speak in your defense, or what you are to say"
Luke,12,12,for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.”
Luke,12,13,"And someone from the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me.”"
Luke,12,14,"But He said to him, “Man, who appointed Me a judge or arbitrator over you?”"
Luke,12,15,"Then He said to them, “Watch out and be on your guard against every form of greed, for not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions.”"
Luke,12,16,"And He told them a parable, saying, “The land of a rich man was very productive."
Luke,12,17,"And he began reasoning to himself, saying, ‘What shall I do, since I have no place to store my crops?’"
Luke,12,18,"Then he said, ‘This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods."
Luke,12,19,"And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years to come; take your ease, eat, drink and be merry.” ’"
Luke,12,20,"But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your soul is required of you; and now who will own what you prepared?’"
Luke,12,21,"So is the one who stores up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.”"
Luke,12,22,"And He said to His disciples, “For this reason I say to you, do not worry about your life, as to what you will eat; nor for your body, as to what you will put on."
Luke,12,23,"For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing."
Luke,12,24,"Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap; they have no storeroom nor barn, and yet God feeds them; how much more valuable you are than the birds!"
Luke,12,25,And which of you by worrying can add a single cubit to his life span?
Luke,12,26,"Therefore, if you cannot do even a very little thing, why do you worry about other matters?"
Luke,12,27,"Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, but I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these."
Luke,12,28,"But if God so clothes the grass in the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you? You of little faith!"
Luke,12,29,"And do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not keep worrying."
Luke,12,30,"For all these things the nations of the world eagerly seek, but your Father knows that you need these things."
Luke,12,31,"But seek His kingdom, and these things will be added to you."
Luke,12,32,"Do not fear, little flock, for your Father is well pleased to give you the kingdom."
Luke,12,33,"“Sell your possessions and give it as charity; make yourselves money belts which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near nor moth destroys."
Luke,12,34,"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
Luke,12,35,"“GIRD UP YOUR LOINS, and keep your lamps lit."
Luke,12,36,"And be like men who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast, so that they may immediately open the door to him when he comes and knocks."
Luke,12,37,"Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find awake when he comes; truly I say to you, that he will gird himself to serve, and have them recline at the table, and will come up and wait on them."
Luke,12,38,"Whether he comes in the second watch, or even in the third, and finds them so, blessed are those slaves."
Luke,12,39,"“But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have allowed his house to be broken into."
Luke,12,40,"You too, be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not expect.”"
Luke,12,41,"Now Peter said, “Lord, are You addressing this parable to us, or to everyone else as well?”"
Luke,12,42,"And the Lord said, “Who then is the faithful and prudent steward, whom his master will put in charge of his servants, to give them their rations at the proper time?"
Luke,12,43,Blessed is that slave whom his master finds so doing when he comes.
Luke,12,44,Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
Luke,12,45,"But if that slave says in his heart, ‘My master will be a long time in coming,’ and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk"
Luke,12,46,"the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces, and assign him a place with the unbelievers."
Luke,12,47,"And that slave who knew his master’s will and did not get ready or act in accord with his will, will receive many beatings"
Luke,12,48,"but the one who did not know it, and committed deeds worthy of a beating, will receive but a few. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required, and to whom they entrusted much, of him they will ask all the more."
Luke,12,49,"“I have come to cast fire upon the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!"
Luke,12,50,"But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is finished!"
Luke,12,51,"Do you think that I came to grant peace on earth? I tell you, no, but rather division"
Luke,12,52,"for from now on five members in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three."
Luke,12,53,"They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”"
Luke,12,54,"And He was also saying to the crowds, “When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, ‘A shower is coming,’ and so it happens."
Luke,12,55,"And when you see a south wind blowing, you say, ‘It will be a hot day,’ and it happens."
Luke,12,56,"You hypocrites! You know how to examine the appearance of the earth and the sky, but why do you not examine this present time?"
Luke,12,57,“And why do you not even judge for yourselves what is right?
Luke,12,58,"For while you are going with your opponent to appear before the magistrate, on your way there make an effort to settle with him, so that he may not drag you before the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison."
Luke,12,59,"I say to you, you will not get out of there until you have paid the last lepton.”"
Luke,13,1,Now at that same time there were some present who were reporting to Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
Luke,13,2,"And Jesus answered and said to them, “Do you think that these Galileans were greater sinners than all other Galileans because they suffered these things?"
Luke,13,3,"I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish."
Luke,13,4,Or do you think that those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them were worse offenders than all the men who live in Jerusalem?
Luke,13,5,"I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.”"
Luke,13,6,And He was telling this parable: “A man had a fig tree which had been planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit on it and did not find any.
Luke,13,7,"And he said to the vineyard-keeper, ‘Behold, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree without finding any. Cut it down! Why does it even use up the ground?’"
Luke,13,8,"And he answered and said to him, ‘Let it alone, sir, for this year too, until I dig around it and put in manure"
Luke,13,9,"and if it bears fruit next year, fine, but if not, cut it down.’ ”"
Luke,13,10,And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
Luke,13,11,"And behold, there was a woman who for eighteen years had a sickness caused by a spirit, and she was bent double, and could not straighten up at all."
Luke,13,12,"But when Jesus saw her, He called her over and said to her, “Woman, you are freed from your sickness.”"
Luke,13,13,"And He laid His hands on her, and immediately she was made erect again and began glorifying God."
Luke,13,14,"But the synagogue official, indignant because Jesus healed on the Sabbath, answered and was saying to the crowd, “There are six days in which work should be done; so come during them and get healed, and not on the Sabbath day.”"
Luke,13,15,"But the Lord answered him and said, “You hypocrites, does not each of you on the Sabbath release his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead it away to water it?"
Luke,13,16,"And this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound for—behold—eighteen years, should she not have been released from this bond on the Sabbath day?”"
Luke,13,17,"And as He said this, all His opponents were being put to shame; and the entire crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things being done by Him."
Luke,13,18,"Therefore, He was saying, “What is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I compare it?"
Luke,13,19,"It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and threw into his own garden, and it grew and became a tree, and THE BIRDS OF THE AIR NESTED IN ITS BRANCHES.”"
Luke,13,20,"And again He said, “To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?"
Luke,13,21,"It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three sata of flour until it was all leavened.”"
Luke,13,22,"And He was passing through from one city and village to another, teaching, and proceeding on His way to Jerusalem."
Luke,13,23,"And someone said to Him, “Lord, are there just a few who are being saved?” And He said to them"
Luke,13,24,"“Strive to enter through the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able."
Luke,13,25,"Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door, saying, ‘Lord, open up to us!’ then He will answer and say to you, ‘I do not know where you are from.’"
Luke,13,26,"Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets.’"
Luke,13,27,"And He will say, ‘I tell you, I do not know where you are from; DEPART FROM ME, ALL YOU WORKERS OF UNRIGHTEOUSNESS.’"
Luke,13,28,"In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves being cast out."
Luke,13,29,"And they will come from east and west and from north and south, and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God."
Luke,13,30,"And behold, some are last who will be first and some are first who will be last.”"
Luke,13,31,"Just at that time some Pharisees approached, saying to Him, “Leave and go from here, for Herod wants to kill You.”"
Luke,13,32,"And He said to them, “Go and tell that fox, ‘Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and on the third day I finish.’"
Luke,13,33,"Nevertheless I must journey on today and tomorrow and the next day, for it is not possible that a prophet would perish outside of Jerusalem."
Luke,13,34,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you did not want it!"
Luke,13,35,"Behold, your house is left to you desolate, and I say to you, you will not see Me until the time comes when you say, ‘BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!’ ”"
Luke,14,1,"And it happened that when He went into the house of one of the leaders of the Pharisees on the Sabbath to eat bread, they were watching Him closely."
Luke,14,2,"And behold, in front of Him was a man suffering from dropsy."
Luke,14,3,"And Jesus answered and spoke to the scholars of the Law and Pharisees, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?”"
Luke,14,4,"But they were silent. And He took hold of him, healed him, and sent him away."
Luke,14,5,"And He said to them, “Which one of you will have a son or an ox fall into a well, and will not immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?”"
Luke,14,6,And they could make no reply to this.
Luke,14,7,"And He was telling a parable to the invited guests when He noticed how they were picking out the places of honor at the table, saying to them"
Luke,14,8,"“When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not recline at the place of honor, lest someone more highly regarded than you be invited by him"
Luke,14,9,"and he who invited you both will come and say to you, ‘Give your place to this man,’ and then in shame you proceed to occupy the last place."
Luke,14,10,"But when you are invited, go and recline at the last place, so that when the one who has invited you comes, he may say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher’; then you will have honor in the sight of all who recline at the table with you."
Luke,14,11,"For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.”"
Luke,14,12,"And He also went on to say to the one who had invited Him, “When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and that will be your repayment."
Luke,14,13,"But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind"
Luke,14,14,"and you will be blessed, since they do not have the means to repay you; for it will be repaid to you at the resurrection of the righteous.”"
Luke,14,15,"But when one of those who were reclining at the table with Him heard this, he said to Him, “Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!”"
Luke,14,16,"And He said to him, “A man was giving a big dinner, and he invited many."
Luke,14,17,"And at the dinner hour he sent his slave to say to those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is ready now.’"
Luke,14,18,"But they all alike began to make excuses. The first one said to him, ‘I have bought a piece of land and I need to go out and look at it. I ask you, consider me excused.’"
Luke,14,19,"And another one said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out. I ask you, consider me excused.’"
Luke,14,20,"And another one said, ‘I have married a wife, and for that reason I cannot come.’"
Luke,14,21,"And when the slave came back, he reported these things to his master. Then the head of the household became angry and said to his slave, ‘Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.’"
Luke,14,22,"And the slave said, ‘Master, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.’"
Luke,14,23,"And the master said to the slave, ‘Go out into the highways and along the fences, and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled."
Luke,14,24,"For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste of my dinner.’ ”"
Luke,14,25,"Now many crowds were going along with Him, and He turned and said to them"
Luke,14,26,"“If anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple."
Luke,14,27,Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.
Luke,14,28,"For which one of you, when he wants to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it?"
Luke,14,29,"Lest, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who observe it begin to ridicule him"
Luke,14,30,"saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’"
Luke,14,31,"Or what king, when he sets out to meet another king in battle, will not first sit down and consider whether he is strong enough with ten thousand men to encounter the one coming against him with twenty thousand?"
Luke,14,32,"Or else, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace."
Luke,14,33,"So then, none of you can be My disciple who does not give up all his own possessions."
Luke,14,34,"“Therefore, salt is good, but if even salt has become tasteless, with what will it be seasoned?"
Luke,14,35,"It is useless either for the soil or for the manure pile; it is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”"
Luke,15,1,Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming near Him to listen to Him.
Luke,15,2,"And both the Pharisees and the scribes were grumbling, saying, “This man receives sinners and eats with them.”"
Luke,15,3,"So He told them this parable, saying"
Luke,15,4,"“What man among you, if he has one hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?"
Luke,15,5,"And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing."
Luke,15,6,"And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!’"
Luke,15,7,"I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance."
Luke,15,8,"“Or what woman, if she has ten drachmas and loses one drachma, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?"
Luke,15,9,"And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost!’"
Luke,15,10,"In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”"
Luke,15,11,"And He said, “A man had two sons."
Luke,15,12,"And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to me.’ So he divided his wealth between them."
Luke,15,13,"And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey into a distant country, and there he squandered his estate living recklessly."
Luke,15,14,"Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began to be impoverished."
Luke,15,15,"So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine."
Luke,15,16,"And he was desiring to be fed with the pods that the swine were eating, and no one was giving anything to him."
Luke,15,17,"But when he came to himself, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired men have more than enough bread, but I am dying here with hunger!"
Luke,15,18,"I will rise up and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before you."
Luke,15,19,I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired men.” ’
Luke,15,20,"So he rose up and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him."
Luke,15,21,"And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’"
Luke,15,22,"But the father said to his slaves, ‘Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet"
Luke,15,23,"and bring the fattened calf, slaughter it, and let us eat and celebrate"
Luke,15,24,for this son of mine was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.’ And they began to celebrate.
Luke,15,25,"“Now his older son was in the field, and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing."
Luke,15,26,"And summoning one of the servants, he began inquiring what these things could be."
Luke,15,27,"And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound.’"
Luke,15,28,"But he became angry and was not wanting to go in, and his father came out and began pleading with him."
Luke,15,29,"But he answered and said to his father, ‘Look! For so many years I have been serving you and never have I neglected a command of yours. And yet never have you given me a young goat, so that I might celebrate with my friends."
Luke,15,30,"But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your wealth with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.’"
Luke,15,31,"And he said to him, ‘Child, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours."
Luke,15,32,"But we had to celebrate and rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead and is alive, and was lost and has been found.’ ”"
Luke,16,1,"Now He was also saying to the disciples, “There was a rich man who had a steward, and this steward was reported to him as squandering his possessions."
Luke,16,2,"And he called for him and said to him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an accounting of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.’"
Luke,16,3,"And the steward said to himself, ‘What shall I do, since my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg."
Luke,16,4,"I know what I shall do, so that when I am removed from the stewardship people will take me into their homes.’"
Luke,16,5,"And he summoned each one of his master’s debtors, and he began saying to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’"
Luke,16,6,"And he said, ‘One hundred baths of oil.’ And he said to him, ‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.’"
Luke,16,7,"Then he said to another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ And he said, ‘One hundred kors of wheat.’ He *said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’"
Luke,16,8,"And his master praised the unrighteous steward because he had acted shrewdly, for the sons of this age are more shrewd in relation to their own kind than the sons of light."
Luke,16,9,"And I say to you, make friends for yourselves from the wealth of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they will take you into the eternal dwellings."
Luke,16,10,"“He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much, and he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much."
Luke,16,11,"Therefore if you have not been faithful in the use of unrighteous wealth, who will entrust the true riches to you?"
Luke,16,12,"And if you have not been faithful in the use of that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?"
Luke,16,13,"No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.”"
Luke,16,14,"Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were listening to all these things and were scoffing at Him."
Luke,16,15,"And He said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts, for that which is highly esteemed among men is detestable in the sight of God."
Luke,16,16,"“The Law and the Prophets were until John; since that time the good news of the kingdom of God is proclaimed, and everyone is forcing his way into it."
Luke,16,17,But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fail.
Luke,16,18,"“Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman who is divorced from a husband commits adultery."
Luke,16,19,"“Now there was a rich man, and he habitually dressed in purple and fine linen, joyously living in splendor every day."
Luke,16,20,"But a poor man named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores"
Luke,16,21,"and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which were falling from the rich man’s table; besides, even the dogs were coming and licking his sores."
Luke,16,22,"Now it happened that the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s bosom, and the rich man also died and was buried."
Luke,16,23,"And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and *saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom."
Luke,16,24,"And he cried out and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.’"
Luke,16,25,"But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that during your life you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus bad things. But now he is being comforted here, and you are in agony."
Luke,16,26,"And besides all this, between us and you there is a great chasm fixed, so that those who wish to come over from here to you are not able, and none may cross over from there to us.’"
Luke,16,27,"And he said, ‘Then I am asking you, father, that you send him to my father’s house"
Luke,16,28,"for I have five brothers—in order that he may warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.’"
Luke,16,29,"But Abraham *said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.’"
Luke,16,30,"But he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent!’"
Luke,16,31,"But he said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.’ ”"
Luke,17,1,"Now He said to His disciples, “It is inevitable that stumbling blocks come, but woe to him through whom they come!"
Luke,17,2,"It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he would cause one of these little ones to stumble."
Luke,17,3,"Be on your guard! If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him."
Luke,17,4,"And if he sins against you seven times a day, and returns to you seven times, saying, ‘I repent,’ forgive him.”"
Luke,17,5,"And the apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”"
Luke,17,6,"And the Lord said, “If you have faith like a mustard seed, you would say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and be planted in the sea’; and it would obey you."
Luke,17,7,"“But which of you, having a slave plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, ‘Come immediately and sit down to eat’?"
Luke,17,8,"But will he not say to him, ‘Prepare something for me to eat, and, clothing yourself properly, serve me while I eat and drink; and afterward you may eat and drink’?"
Luke,17,9,Is he grateful to the slave because he did the things which were commanded?
Luke,17,10,"In this way, you also, when you do all the things which are commanded of you, say, ‘We are unworthy slaves; we have done only that which we ought to have done.’ ”"
Luke,17,11,"And it happened that while He was on the way to Jerusalem, He was passing through Samaria and Galilee."
Luke,17,12,"And as He entered a village, ten leprous men who stood at a distance met Him."
Luke,17,13,"And they raised their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”"
Luke,17,14,"When He saw them, He said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And it happened that as they were going, they were cleansed."
Luke,17,15,"Now one of them, when he saw that he had been healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice"
Luke,17,16,"and he fell on his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him. And he was a Samaritan."
Luke,17,17,"Then Jesus answered and said, “Were there not ten cleansed? But the nine—where are they?"
Luke,17,18,"Was there no one found who turned back to give glory to God, except this foreigner?”"
Luke,17,19,"And He said to him, “Stand up and go; your faith has saved you.”"
Luke,17,20,"Now having been questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God was coming, He answered them and said, “The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed"
Luke,17,21,"nor will they say, ‘Look, here!’ or, ‘There!’ For behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.”"
Luke,17,22,"And He said to the disciples, “The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it."
Luke,17,23,"And they will say to you, ‘Look there! Look here!’ Do not go away, and do not run after them."
Luke,17,24,"For just like the lightning, when it flashes out of one part of the sky, shines to the other part of the sky, so will the Son of Man be in His day."
Luke,17,25,But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
Luke,17,26,"And just as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man"
Luke,17,27,"they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all."
Luke,17,28,"It was the same as in the days of Lot—they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building"
Luke,17,29,but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.
Luke,17,30,It will be just the same on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.
Luke,17,31,"On that day, the one who is on the housetop and whose goods are in the house must not go down to take them out, and likewise the one who is in the field must not turn back."
Luke,17,32,Remember Lot’s wife.
Luke,17,33,"Whoever seeks to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it."
Luke,17,34,"I tell you, on that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left."
Luke,17,35,There will be two women grinding grain at the same place; one will be taken and the other will be left.
Luke,17,36,[Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left.”]
Luke,17,37,"And answering they *said to Him, “Where, Lord?” And He said to them, “Where the body is, there also the vultures will be gathered.”"
Luke,18,1,Now He was telling them a parable to show that at all times they ought to pray and not to lose heart
Luke,18,2,"saying, “In a certain city there was a certain judge who did not fear God and did not respect man."
Luke,18,3,"Now there was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him, saying, ‘Give me justice from my opponent.’"
Luke,18,4,"And for a while he was unwilling; but afterward he said to himself, ‘Even though I do not fear God nor respect man"
Luke,18,5,"yet because this widow is bothering me, I will give her justice, lest by continually coming she wears me out.’ ”"
Luke,18,6,"And the Lord said, “Hear what the unjust judge *said."
Luke,18,7,"Now, will God not bring about justice for His elect who cry to Him day and night, and will He delay long over them?"
Luke,18,8,"I tell you that He will bring about justice for them quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will He find that faith on the earth?”"
Luke,18,9,"And He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and viewed others with contempt"
Luke,18,10,"“Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector."
Luke,18,11,"The Pharisee stood and was praying these things to himself: ‘God, I thank You that I am not like other people: swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector."
Luke,18,12,I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all that I get.’
Luke,18,13,"But the tax collector, standing some distance away, was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven, but was beating his chest, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, the sinner!’"
Luke,18,14,"I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other, for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”"
Luke,18,15,"And they were bringing even their babies to Him so that He would touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they were rebuking them."
Luke,18,16,"But Jesus called for them, saying, “Permit the children to come to Me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."
Luke,18,17,"Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.”"
Luke,18,18,"And a ruler questioned Him, saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”"
Luke,18,19,"And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone."
Luke,18,20,"You know the commandments, ‘DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, DO NOT MURDER, DO NOT STEAL, DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS, HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER.’ ”"
Luke,18,21,"And he said, “All these things I have kept from my youth.”"
Luke,18,22,"And when Jesus heard this, He said to him, “One thing you still lack: sell all that you possess and distribute it to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven. And come, follow Me.”"
Luke,18,23,"But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich."
Luke,18,24,"And Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!"
Luke,18,25,For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”
Luke,18,26,"And those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?”"
Luke,18,27,"But He said, “The things that are impossible with people are possible with God.”"
Luke,18,28,"And Peter said, “Behold, we have left all that is our own and followed You.”"
Luke,18,29,"And He said to them, “Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God"
Luke,18,30,"who will not receive many times more at this time and in the age to come, eternal life.”"
Luke,18,31,"But when He took the twelve aside, He said to them, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things which are written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be completed."
Luke,18,32,"For He will be delivered over to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and mistreated and spit upon"
Luke,18,33,"and after they have flogged Him, they will kill Him, and the third day He will rise again.”"
Luke,18,34,"But the disciples understood none of these things, and this statement was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend the things that were said."
Luke,18,35,"Now it happened that as Jesus was approaching Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the road begging."
Luke,18,36,"Now hearing a crowd going by, he began to inquire what this was."
Luke,18,37,"They reported to him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.”"
Luke,18,38,"And he called out, saying, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”"
Luke,18,39,"And those who went ahead were rebuking him so that he would be quiet, but he kept crying out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”"
Luke,18,40,"And Jesus stopped and commanded that he be brought to Him, and when he came near, He questioned him"
Luke,18,41,"“What do you want Me to do for you?” And he said, “Lord, I want to regain my sight!”"
Luke,18,42,"And Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has saved you.”"
Luke,18,43,"Immediately he regained his sight and began following Him, glorifying God. And when all the people saw it, they gave praise to God."
Luke,19,1,And He entered Jericho and was passing through.
Luke,19,2,"And behold, there was a man called by the name of Zaccheus; he was a chief tax collector and he was rich."
Luke,19,3,"And Zaccheus was trying to see who Jesus was, and was unable because of the crowd, for he was small in stature."
Luke,19,4,"So he ran on before and climbed up into a sycamore tree in order to see Him, for He was about to pass through that way."
Luke,19,5,"And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and said to him, “Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.”"
Luke,19,6,And he hurried and came down and received Him gladly.
Luke,19,7,"And when they saw it, they all began to grumble, saying, “He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.”"
Luke,19,8,"But Zaccheus stopped and said to the Lord, “Behold, half of my possessions, Lord, I will give to the poor, and if I have extorted anyone of anything, I will give back four times as much.”"
Luke,19,9,"And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he, too, is a son of Abraham."
Luke,19,10,For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save the lost.”
Luke,19,11,"Now while they were listening to these things, Jesus went on to tell a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately."
Luke,19,12,"So He said, “A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and then return."
Luke,19,13,"And he called ten of his slaves, and gave them ten minas and said to them, ‘Engage in business until I come back.’"
Luke,19,14,"But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to reign over us.’"
Luke,19,15,"And it happened that when he returned, after receiving the kingdom, he ordered that these slaves, to whom he had given the money, be called to him so that he might know how much they had made in business."
Luke,19,16,"So the first appeared, saying, ‘Master, your mina has made ten minas more.’"
Luke,19,17,"And he said to him, ‘Well done, good slave, because you have been faithful in a very little thing, you are to be in authority over ten cities.’"
Luke,19,18,"Then the second came, saying, ‘Your mina, master, has made five minas.’"
Luke,19,19,"And he said to him also, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’"
Luke,19,20,"Then another came, saying, ‘Master, here is your mina, which I kept put away in a cloth"
Luke,19,21,"for I was afraid of you, because you are a strict man; you take up what you did not lay down and reap what you did not sow.’"
Luke,19,22,"He *said to him, ‘From your own mouth I will judge you, you worthless slave. Did you know that I am a strict man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?"
Luke,19,23,"Then why did you not put my money in the bank, and having come, I would have collected it with interest?’"
Luke,19,24,"Then he said to the bystanders, ‘Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.’"
Luke,19,25,"And they said to him, ‘Master, he has ten minas already.’"
Luke,19,26,"‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away."
Luke,19,27,"But these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them in my presence.’ ”"
Luke,19,28,"And after He had said these things, He was going on ahead, going up to Jerusalem."
Luke,19,29,"And it happened that when He approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the mount called “of Olives,” He sent two of the disciples"
Luke,19,30,"saying, “Go into the village ahead of you; in which, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, on which no one yet has ever sat; untie it and bring it here."
Luke,19,31,"And if anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you shall say this: ‘Because the Lord has need of it.’ ”"
Luke,19,32,"So when those who were sent departed, they found it just as He had told them."
Luke,19,33,"And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?”"
Luke,19,34,"And they said, “The Lord has need of it.”"
Luke,19,35,"And they brought it to Jesus, and after they threw their garments on the colt, they put Jesus on it."
Luke,19,36,"And as He was going, they were spreading their garments on the road."
Luke,19,37,"Now as soon as He was approaching, near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God, rejoicing with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen"
Luke,19,38,"saying,
“BLESSED IS THE KING WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD.
Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”"
Luke,19,39,"And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.”"
Luke,19,40,"But Jesus answered and said, “I tell you, if these were silent, the stones will cry out!”"
Luke,19,41,"And as He approached Jerusalem and saw the city, He cried over it"
Luke,19,42,"saying, “If you knew in this day, even you, the things which make for peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes."
Luke,19,43,"For the days will come upon you when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, and surround you and hem you in on every side"
Luke,19,44,"and they will level you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.”"
Luke,19,45,And Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling
Luke,19,46,"saying to them, “It is written, ‘AND MY HOUSE SHALL BE A HOUSE OF PRAYER,’ but you have made it a ROBBERS’ DEN.”"
Luke,19,47,"And He was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people were trying to destroy Him"
Luke,19,48,"and they could not find anything that they might do, for all the people hung upon every word He said."
Luke,20,1,"And it happened that on one of the days while He was teaching the people in the temple and proclaiming the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up to Him"
Luke,20,2,"and they spoke, saying to Him, “Tell us by what authority You are doing these things, or who is the one who gave You this authority?”"
Luke,20,3,"And Jesus answered and said to them, “I will also ask you a question, and you tell Me"
Luke,20,4,Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?”
Luke,20,5,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’"
Luke,20,6,"But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.”"
Luke,20,7,So they answered that they did not know where it came from.
Luke,20,8,"And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”"
Luke,20,9,"And He began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard and rented it out to vine-growers, and went on a journey for a long time."
Luke,20,10,"And at the harvest time he sent a slave to the vine-growers, so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the vine-growers sent him away empty-handed having beaten him."
Luke,20,11,"And he proceeded to send another slave; and when they beat him also and treated him shamefully, they sent him away empty-handed."
Luke,20,12,And he proceeded to send a third; and this one also they wounded and cast out.
Luke,20,13,"Now the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.’"
Luke,20,14,"But when the vine-growers saw him, they were reasoning with one another, saying, ‘This is the heir; let us kill him so that the inheritance will be ours.’"
Luke,20,15,"So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?"
Luke,20,16,"He will come and destroy these vine-growers and will give the vineyard to others.” When they heard this, they said, “May it never be!”"
Luke,20,17,"But when Jesus looked at them, He said, “What then is this that is written:
‘THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED,
THIS HAS BECOME THE CHIEF CORNER stone’?"
Luke,20,18,"Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but on whomever it falls, it will scatter him like dust.”"
Luke,20,19,"And the scribes and the chief priests tried to lay hands on Him that very hour, but they feared the people. For they understood that He spoke this parable against them."
Luke,20,20,"So they watched Him, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, so that they might catch Him in some statement, in order to deliver Him to the rule and the authority of the governor."
Luke,20,21,"And they questioned Him, saying, “Teacher, we know that You speak and teach correctly, and You are not partial to any, but teach the way of God in truth."
Luke,20,22,"Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”"
Luke,20,23,But He perceived their craftiness and said to them
Luke,20,24,"“Show Me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it have?” They said, “Caesar’s.”"
Luke,20,25,"And He said to them, “Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”"
Luke,20,26,"And they were unable to catch Him in a word in the presence of the people; and marveling at His answer, they became silent."
Luke,20,27,Now some of the Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection) came to Him
Luke,20,28,"and they questioned Him, saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that IF A MAN’S BROTHER DIES, having a wife, AND HE IS CHILDLESS, HIS BROTHER SHOULD MARRY THE WIFE AND RAISE UP SEED FOR HIS BROTHER."
Luke,20,29,Now there were seven brothers; and the first married a wife and died childless
Luke,20,30,and the second
Luke,20,31,"and the third married her; and in the same way, all seven died, leaving no children."
Luke,20,32,Finally the woman died also.
Luke,20,33,"Therefore, this woman—in the resurrection—whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as a wife.”"
Luke,20,34,"And Jesus said to them, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage"
Luke,20,35,"but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage."
Luke,20,36,"For they cannot even die anymore, because they are like angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection."
Luke,20,37,"But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed in the passage about the burning bush, where he calls the Lord THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB."
Luke,20,38,Now He is not the God of the dead but of the living; for all live to Him.”
Luke,20,39,"And some of the scribes answered and said, “Teacher, You have spoken well.”"
Luke,20,40,For they did not dare to question Him any longer about anything.
Luke,20,41,"Then He said to them, “How is it that they say the Christ is David’s son?"
Luke,20,42,"For David himself says in the book of Psalms,
‘THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD,
“SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND"
Luke,20,43,UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES AS A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET.” ’
Luke,20,44,"Therefore David calls Him ‘Lord,’ so how is He his son?”"
Luke,20,45,"And while all the people were listening, He said to the disciples"
Luke,20,46,"“Beware of the scribes, who want to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, and best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets"
Luke,20,47,"who devour widows’ houses, and for appearance’s sake offer long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.”"
Luke,21,1,And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury.
Luke,21,2,And He saw a poor widow putting in two lepta.
Luke,21,3,"And He said, “Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all of them."
Luke,21,4,"For they all put in their gifts out of their abundance; but she, out of what she lacked, put in all that she had for living.”"
Luke,21,5,"And while some were talking about the temple, that it had been adorned with beautiful stones and dedicated gifts, He said"
Luke,21,6,"“As for these things which you are looking at, the days will come in which there will not be left one stone upon another which will not be torn down.”"
Luke,21,7,"So they questioned Him, saying, “Teacher, when therefore will these things happen? And what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?”"
Luke,21,8,"And He said, “See to it that you are not deceived; for many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am He,’ and, ‘The time is at hand.’ Do not go after them."
Luke,21,9,"And when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified; for these things must take place first, but the end does not follow immediately.”"
Luke,21,10,"Then He continued saying to them, “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom"
Luke,21,11,"and there will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and plagues; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven."
Luke,21,12,"“But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for My name’s sake."
Luke,21,13,It will result in an opportunity for your testimony.
Luke,21,14,So set in your hearts not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves
Luke,21,15,for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute.
Luke,21,16,"But you will be betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death"
Luke,21,17,and you will be hated by all because of My name.
Luke,21,18,Yet not a hair of your head will perish.
Luke,21,19,By your perseverance you will gain your lives.
Luke,21,20,"“But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand."
Luke,21,21,"Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those who are in the midst of the city must leave, and those who are in the countryside must not enter the city"
Luke,21,22,"because these are days of vengeance, so that all things which are written will be fulfilled."
Luke,21,23,Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days; for there will be great distress upon the land and wrath against this people
Luke,21,24,"and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled."
Luke,21,25,"“And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth anguish among nations, in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves"
Luke,21,26,men fainting from fear and the expectation of the things which are coming upon the world; for the POWERS OF THE HEAVENS will be shaken.
Luke,21,27,And then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN A CLOUD with power and great glory.
Luke,21,28,"But when these things begin to take place, straighten up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”"
Luke,21,29,Then He told them a parable: “Behold the fig tree and all the trees
Luke,21,30,"as soon as they put forth leaves and you see it for yourselves, know that summer is now near."
Luke,21,31,"So you also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near."
Luke,21,32,"Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all things take place."
Luke,21,33,"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away."
Luke,21,34,"“But be on guard, so that your hearts will not be overcome with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of life, and that day will not come on you suddenly like a trap"
Luke,21,35,for it will come upon all those who inhabit the face of all the earth.
Luke,21,36,"But keep on the alert at all times, praying earnestly that you may have strength to escape all these things that are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.”"
Luke,21,37,"Now during the day He was teaching in the temple, but during the night He would go out and spend it on the mount called “of Olives.”"
Luke,21,38,And all the people would get up early in the morning to come to Him in the temple to listen to Him.
Luke,22,1,"Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was drawing near."
Luke,22,2,And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might put Him to death; for they were afraid of the people.
Luke,22,3,"And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, who belonged to the number of the twelve."
Luke,22,4,And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray Him to them.
Luke,22,5,And they were glad and agreed to give him money.
Luke,22,6,"So he consented, and began seeking a good opportunity to betray Him to them apart from the crowd."
Luke,22,7,Then came the first day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.
Luke,22,8,"And Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us, so that we may eat it.”"
Luke,22,9,"And they said to Him, “Where do You want us to prepare it?”"
Luke,22,10,"And He said to them, “Behold, after you have entered the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house that he enters."
Luke,22,11,"And you shall say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?” ’"
Luke,22,12,"And he will show you a large, furnished upper room; prepare it there.”"
Luke,22,13,And they left and found everything just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover.
Luke,22,14,"And when the hour had come, He reclined at the table, and the apostles with Him."
Luke,22,15,"And He said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer"
Luke,22,16,"for I say to you, I shall never again eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”"
Luke,22,17,"And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He said, “Take this and share it among yourselves."
Luke,22,18,"For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.”"
Luke,22,19,"And when He had taken some bread and given thanks, He broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is My body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of Me.”"
Luke,22,20,"And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten, saying, “This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in My blood."
Luke,22,21,"But behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Me on the table."
Luke,22,22,"For indeed, the Son of Man is going as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!”"
Luke,22,23,And they began to argue among themselves which one of them it might be who was going to do this thing.
Luke,22,24,And there arose also a dispute among them as to which one of them was regarded to be greatest.
Luke,22,25,"And He said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called ‘Benefactors.’"
Luke,22,26,"But not so with you; rather the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like the servant."
Luke,22,27,"For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as the one who serves."
Luke,22,28,“Now you are those who have stood by Me in My trials
Luke,22,29,"and I grant you a kingdom, just as My Father granted one to Me"
Luke,22,30,"that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Luke,22,31,"“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat."
Luke,22,32,"But I have prayed earnestly for you, that your faith may not fail; and you, once you have returned, strengthen your brothers.”"
Luke,22,33,"But he said to Him, “Lord, with You I am ready to go both to prison and to death!”"
Luke,22,34,"And He said, “I say to you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.”"
Luke,22,35,"And He said to them, “When I sent you out without money belt and bag and sandals, did you lack anything?” They said, “Not a thing.”"
Luke,22,36,"And He said to them, “But now, whoever has a money belt is to take it along, likewise also a bag, and whoever has no sword should sell his garment and buy one."
Luke,22,37,"For I tell you that this which is written must be completed in Me, ‘AND HE WAS NUMBERED WITH TRANSGRESSORS’; for that which refers to Me has its completion.”"
Luke,22,38,"And they said, “Lord, look, here are two swords.” And He said to them, “It is enough.”"
Luke,22,39,And He came out and went as was His custom to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him.
Luke,22,40,"Now when He arrived at the place, He said to them, “Pray that you may not enter into temptation.”"
Luke,22,41,"And He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and He knelt down and began to pray"
Luke,22,42,"saying, “Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me, yet not My will, but Yours be done.”"
Luke,22,43,"Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him."
Luke,22,44,"And being in agony He was praying very fervently, and His sweat became like drops of blood, falling down upon the ground."
Luke,22,45,"And when He rose from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow"
Luke,22,46,"and said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Rise up and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”"
Luke,22,47,"While He was still speaking, behold, a crowd came, and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was coming ahead of them, and he approached Jesus to kiss Him."
Luke,22,48,"But Jesus said to him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”"
Luke,22,49,"And when those around Him saw what was going to happen, they said, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”"
Luke,22,50,And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
Luke,22,51,"But Jesus answered and said, “Stop! No more of this.” And He touched his ear and healed him."
Luke,22,52,"Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come against Him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as against a robber?"
Luke,22,53,"While I was with you daily in the temple, you did not stretch out your hands against Me, but this hour and the authority of darkness are yours.”"
Luke,22,54,"Now having arrested Him, they led Him away and brought Him to the house of the high priest, but Peter was following at a distance."
Luke,22,55,"And after they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter was sitting among them."
Luke,22,56,"And a servant-girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight and looking intently at him, said, “This man was with Him too.”"
Luke,22,57,"But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know Him.”"
Luke,22,58,"A little later, another saw him and said, “You are one of them too!” But Peter said, “Man, I am not!”"
Luke,22,59,"And after about an hour had passed, another man began to insist, saying, “Certainly this man was with Him too, for he also is a Galilean.”"
Luke,22,60,"But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about.” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed."
Luke,22,61,"And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had told him, “Before a rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.”"
Luke,22,62,And he went out and cried bitterly.
Luke,22,63,Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking Him while they beat Him
Luke,22,64,"and they blindfolded Him and were asking Him, saying, “Prophesy, who is the one who hit You?”"
Luke,22,65,"And they were saying many other things against Him, blaspheming."
Luke,22,66,"And as the day came, the Council of elders of the people assembled, both chief priests and scribes, and they led Him away to their Sanhedrin, saying"
Luke,22,67,"“If You are the Christ, tell us.” But He said to them, “If I tell you, you will not believe"
Luke,22,68,"and if I ask a question, you will not answer."
Luke,22,69,But from now on THE SON OF MAN WILL BE SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND of the power OF GOD.”
Luke,22,70,"And they all said, “Are You the Son of God, then?” And He said to them, “You yourselves say that I am.”"
Luke,22,71,"Then they said, “What further need do we have of testimony? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth.”"
Luke,23,1,Then their whole assembly rose up and brought Him before Pilate.
Luke,23,2,"And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.”"
Luke,23,3,"So Pilate asked Him, saying, “Are You the King of the Jews?” And He answered him and said, “You yourself say it.”"
Luke,23,4,"Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no guilt in this man.”"
Luke,23,5,"But they kept on insisting, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching all over Judea, starting from Galilee even as far as this place.”"
Luke,23,6,"Now when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean."
Luke,23,7,"And when he learned that He belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself also was in Jerusalem in those days."
Luke,23,8,"Now when Herod saw Jesus, he rejoiced greatly; for he had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had been hearing about Him and was hoping to see some sign performed by Him."
Luke,23,9,"And he questioned Him at some length, but He answered him nothing."
Luke,23,10,"And the chief priests and the scribes were standing there, vehemently accusing Him."
Luke,23,11,"And Herod with his soldiers, after treating Him with contempt and mocking Him, dressed Him in a bright robe and sent Him back to Pilate."
Luke,23,12,Now Herod and Pilate became friends with one another that very day; for before they had been at enmity with each other.
Luke,23,13,And Pilate summoned the chief priests and the rulers and the people
Luke,23,14,"and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one who incites the people to rebellion, and behold, having examined Him before you, I have found in this man no guilt of what you are accusing Him."
Luke,23,15,"No, nor has Herod, for he sent Him back to us; and behold, nothing deserving death has been done by Him."
Luke,23,16,Therefore I will punish Him and release Him.”
Luke,23,17,[Now he was obliged to release to them at the feast one prisoner.]
Luke,23,18,"But they cried out all together, saying, “Away with this man, and release for us Barabbas!”"
Luke,23,19,(He had been thrown into prison for an insurrection made in the city and for murder.)
Luke,23,20,"But again Pilate addressed them, wanting to release Jesus"
Luke,23,21,"but they kept on calling out, saying, “Crucify, crucify Him!”"
Luke,23,22,"And he said to them a third time, “Why, what evil has this man done? I have found in Him no guilt worthy of death; therefore I will punish Him and release Him.”"
Luke,23,23,"But they were insistent, with loud voices asking that He be crucified. And their voices were prevailing."
Luke,23,24,And Pilate pronounced sentence that their demand be granted.
Luke,23,25,"And he released the man they were asking for who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, but he delivered Jesus to their will."
Luke,23,26,"And when they led Him away, they took hold of a man, Simon of Cyrene, coming in from the country, and placed on him the cross to carry behind Jesus."
Luke,23,27,"And following Him was a large multitude of the people, and of women who were mourning and lamenting Him."
Luke,23,28,"But Jesus, turning to them, said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, stop crying for Me, but cry for yourselves and for your children."
Luke,23,29,"For behold, the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’"
Luke,23,30,"Then they will begin TO SAY TO THE MOUNTAINS, ‘FALL ON US,’ AND TO THE HILLS, ‘COVER US.’"
Luke,23,31,"For if they do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?”"
Luke,23,32,"Now two others also, who were criminals, were being led away to be put to death with Him."
Luke,23,33,"And when they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left."
Luke,23,34,"But Jesus was saying, “Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.” AND THEY CAST LOTS, DIVIDING UP HIS GARMENTS AMONG THEMSELVES."
Luke,23,35,"And the people stood by, looking on. And even the rulers were scoffing at Him, saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God, His Chosen One.”"
Luke,23,36,"And the soldiers also mocked Him, coming up to Him, offering Him sour wine"
Luke,23,37,"and saying, “If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!”"
Luke,23,38,"Now there was also an inscription above Him, “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”"
Luke,23,39,"And one of the criminals hanging there was blaspheming Him, saying, “Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!”"
Luke,23,40,"But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?"
Luke,23,41,"And we indeed are suffering justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for what we have done; but this man has done nothing wrong.”"
Luke,23,42,"And he was saying, “Jesus, remember me when You come in Your kingdom!”"
Luke,23,43,"And He said to him, “Truly I say to you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise.”"
Luke,23,44,"And it was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour"
Luke,23,45,because the sun was obscured. And the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two.
Luke,23,46,"And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, “Father, INTO YOUR HANDS I COMMIT MY SPIRIT.” Having said this, He breathed His last."
Luke,23,47,"Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he began praising God, saying, “Certainly this man was righteous.”"
Luke,23,48,"And all the crowds who came together for this spectacle, when they observed what had happened, were returning, beating their chests."
Luke,23,49,"And all His acquaintances and the women who accompanied Him from Galilee were standing at a distance, watching these things."
Luke,23,50,"And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a Council member, a good and righteous man"
Luke,23,51,"(he had not consented to their counsel and action), a man from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was waiting for the kingdom of God"
Luke,23,52,this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Luke,23,53,"And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had ever lain."
Luke,23,54,"It was Preparation day, and the Sabbath was about to begin."
Luke,23,55,"Now the women, who had come with Him from Galilee, followed and beheld the tomb and how His body was laid."
Luke,23,56,"Then after they returned, they prepared spices and perfumes.
A nd on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment."
Luke,24,1,"Now on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared."
Luke,24,2,And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb
Luke,24,3,"but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus."
Luke,24,4,"And it happened that while they were perplexed about this, behold, two men suddenly stood near them in dazzling clothing"
Luke,24,5,"and when the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living One among the dead?"
Luke,24,6,"He is not here, but He has risen. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee"
Luke,24,7,"saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.”"
Luke,24,8,And they remembered His words
Luke,24,9,"and when they returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest."
Luke,24,10,Now Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the rest of the women with them were there; they were telling these things to the apostles.
Luke,24,11,"But these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they were not believing them."
Luke,24,12,"But Peter stood up and ran to the tomb; and stooping to look in, he *saw the linen wrappings only. And he went away by himself, marveling at what had happened."
Luke,24,13,"And behold, two of them were going that same day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem."
Luke,24,14,And they were conversing with each other about all these things which had happened.
Luke,24,15,"And it happened that while they were conversing and debating, Jesus Himself approached and was going with them."
Luke,24,16,But their eyes were prevented from recognizing Him.
Luke,24,17,"And He said to them, “What are these words that you are discussing with one another as you are walking?” And they stood still, looking sad."
Luke,24,18,"And one of them, named Cleopas, answered and said to Him, “Are You the only one visiting Jerusalem and unaware of the things which have happened here in these days?”"
Luke,24,19,"And He said to them, “What things?” And they said to Him, “The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was a mighty prophet in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people"
Luke,24,20,"and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to the sentence of death, and crucified Him."
Luke,24,21,"But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since these things happened."
Luke,24,22,But also some women among us astounded us. When they were at the tomb early in the morning
Luke,24,23,"and not finding His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive."
Luke,24,24,"Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just exactly as the women also said, but Him they did not see.”"
Luke,24,25,"And He said to them, “O foolish ones and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!"
Luke,24,26,Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?”
Luke,24,27,"Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He interpreted to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures."
Luke,24,28,"And they approached the village where they were going, and He acted as though He were going farther."
Luke,24,29,"But they urged Him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is now nearly over.” So He went in to stay with them."
Luke,24,30,"And it happened that when He had reclined at the table with them, He took the bread and blessed it, and after breaking it, He was giving it to them."
Luke,24,31,Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him. And He vanished from their sight.
Luke,24,32,"And they said to one another, “Were not our hearts burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was opening the Scriptures to us?”"
Luke,24,33,"And they stood up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven and those with them"
Luke,24,34,"who were saying, “The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon.”"
Luke,24,35,And they were relating their experiences on the road and how He was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.
Luke,24,36,"Now while they were telling these things, He Himself stood in their midst and *said to them, “Peace to you.”"
Luke,24,37,"But being startled and frightened, they were thinking that they were seeing a spirit."
Luke,24,38,"And He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?"
Luke,24,39,"See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.”"
Luke,24,40,"And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet."
Luke,24,41,"And while they still were not believing because of their joy and were still marveling, He said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?”"
Luke,24,42,They gave Him a piece of a broiled fish
Luke,24,43,and He took it and ate it before them.
Luke,24,44,"Now He said to them, “These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”"
Luke,24,45,Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures
Luke,24,46,"and He said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise again from the dead the third day"
Luke,24,47,"and that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem."
Luke,24,48,You are witnesses of these things.
Luke,24,49,"And behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you, but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”"
Luke,24,50,"And He led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up His hands, He blessed them."
Luke,24,51,"And it happened that while He was blessing them, He parted from them and was carried up into heaven."
Luke,24,52,"And they, after worshiping Him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy"
Luke,24,53,and were continually in the temple blessing God.
