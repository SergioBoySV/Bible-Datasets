Ezra,1,1,"Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia—in order to complete the word of Yahweh from the mouth of Jeremiah—Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he had a proclamation pass throughout all his kingdom, and also put it in writing, saying"
Ezra,1,2,"“Thus says Cyrus king of Persia,
‘Yahweh, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He has appointed me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah."
Ezra,1,3,"Whoever there is among you of all His people, may his God be with him! Let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and rebuild the house of Yahweh, the God of Israel; He is the God who is in Jerusalem."
Ezra,1,4,"So everyone who remains, at whatever place he may sojourn, let the men of that place support him with silver and gold, with goods and cattle, together with a freewill offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.’ ”"
Ezra,1,5,"Then the heads of fathers’ households of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and the Levites arose, that is of everyone whose spirit God had stirred to go up to rebuild the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem."
Ezra,1,6,"All those around them strengthened them with articles of silver, with gold, with possessions, with cattle, and with precious things, aside from all that was given as a freewill offering."
Ezra,1,7,"Also King Cyrus brought out the articles of the house of Yahweh, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought out from Jerusalem and put in the house of his gods"
Ezra,1,8,"and Cyrus, king of Persia, had them brought out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and he counted them out to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah."
Ezra,1,9,"Now this was their number: 30 gold dishes, 1,000 silver dishes, 29 duplicates"
Ezra,1,10,"30 gold bowls, 410 silver bowls of a second kind and 1,000 other articles."
Ezra,1,11,"All the articles of gold and silver numbered 5,400. Sheshbazzar brought them all up with the exiles who went up from Babylon to Jerusalem."
Ezra,2,1,"Now these are the people of the province who came up out of the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had taken away into exile to Babylon, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his city."
Ezra,2,2,"These came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah.

Ezra,2,60,"the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, 652."
Ezra,2,61,"Of the sons of the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and he was called by their name."
Ezra,2,62,"These searched in their genealogical records, but they could not be found; therefore they were considered unclean and excluded from the priesthood."
Ezra,2,63,The governor said to them that they should not eat from the most holy things until a priest stood with Urim and Thummim.
Ezra,2,64,"¶The whole assembly together was 42,360"

and they had 200 male and female singers."
Ezra,2,66,"Their horses were 736; their mules, 245"
Ezra,2,67,"their camels, 435; their donkeys, 6,720."
Ezra,2,68,"Some of the heads of fathers’ households, when they arrived at the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem, gave a freewill offering for the house of God to restore it on its foundation."
Ezra,2,69,"According to their ability, they gave to the treasury for the work 61,000 gold drachmas and 5,000 silver minas and 100 priestly tunics."
Ezra,2,70,"So the priests and the Levites, some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities."
Ezra,3,1,"Then the seventh month came, and the sons of Israel were in the cities. And the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem."
Ezra,3,2,"Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers arose and built the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God."
Ezra,3,3,"So they set up the altar on its foundation, for they were terrified because of the peoples of the lands; and they offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh, burnt offerings morning and evening."
Ezra,3,4,"They celebrated the Feast of Booths, as it is written, and offered the fixed number of burnt offerings daily, according to the legal judgment, as each day required"
Ezra,3,5,"and afterward there was a continual burnt offering, also for the new moons and for all the appointed times of Yahweh that were set apart as holy, and from everyone who offered a freewill offering to Yahweh."
Ezra,3,6,"From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh, but the foundation of the temple of Yahweh had not been laid."
Ezra,3,7,"Then they gave money to the masons and carpenters, and food, drink, and oil to the Sidonians and to the Tyrians, to bring cedar wood from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa, according to the permission they had from Cyrus king of Persia."
Ezra,3,8,"Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all who came from the captivity to Jerusalem, began the work and appointed the Levites from twenty years and older to direct the work of the house of Yahweh."
Ezra,3,9,"Then Jeshua with his sons and brothers stood united with Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah and the sons of Henadad with their sons and brothers the Levites, to direct those who do the work in the house of God."
Ezra,3,10,"So the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Yahweh. Then the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise Yahweh according to the directions of King David of Israel."
Ezra,3,11,"And they sang, praising and giving thanks to Yahweh, saying, “For He is good, for His lovingkindness endures forever upon Israel.” And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised Yahweh because the foundation of the house of Yahweh was laid."
Ezra,3,12,"Yet many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ households, the old men who had seen the first house of Yahweh, were weeping with a loud voice when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, while many in loud shouts with gladness were raising their voice"
Ezra,3,13,"so that the people could not distinguish the voices of the shouting of gladness from the voices of the weeping of the people, for the people were shouting with a loud shout, and those voices were heard far away."
Ezra,4,1,"Then the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people of the exile were building a temple to Yahweh, the God of Israel"
Ezra,4,2,"so they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of fathers’ households and said to them, “Let us build with you, for we, like you, seek your God; and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.”"
Ezra,4,3,"But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of fathers’ households of Israel said to them, “You have nothing in common with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves will together build to Yahweh, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia has commanded us.”"
Ezra,4,4,So the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah and dismayed them from building
Ezra,4,5,"and hired counselors against them to frustrate their counsel all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia."
Ezra,4,6,"Now in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra,4,7,"And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his colleagues wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the text of the letter was written in Aramaic and translated from Aramaic."
Ezra,4,8,"Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes, as follows"
Ezra,4,9,"then wrote Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their colleagues, the judges and the lesser governors, the officials, the secretaries, the men of Erech, the Babylonians, the men of Susa, that is, the Elamites"
Ezra,4,10,"and the rest of the nations, which the great and honorable Osnappar took away into exile and settled in the city of Samaria and in the rest of the region beyond the River. And now"
Ezra,4,11,"this is the copy of the letter which they sent to him:
“ T o King Artaxerxes: Your servants, the men in the region beyond the River, and now"
Ezra,4,12,let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem; they are rebuilding the rebellious and evil city and are completing the walls and repairing the foundations.
Ezra,4,13,"Now let it be known to the king, that if that city is rebuilt and the walls are completed, they will not give tribute, custom, or toll, and it will damage the revenue of the kings."
Ezra,4,14,"Now because we are in the service of the palace, and it is not fitting for us to see the king’s dishonor, therefore we have sent and made known to the king"
Ezra,4,15,"that a search be made in the record books of your fathers. And you will find in the record books and come to know that that city is a rebellious city and damaging to kings and provinces, and that they have incited revolt within it in past days; therefore that city was laid waste."
Ezra,4,16,"We make known to the king that if that city is rebuilt and the walls completed, as a result you will have no portion in the province beyond the River.”"
Ezra,4,17,"Then the king sent an edict to Rehum the commander, to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their colleagues who live in Samaria and in the rest of the provinces beyond the River: “Peace. And now"
Ezra,4,18,the document which you sent to us has been plainly read before me.
Ezra,4,19,"So a decree has been issued by me, and a search has been made and it has been found that that city has lifted itself up against the kings in past days, that rebellion and revolt have been perpetrated in it"
Ezra,4,20,"that strong kings have been over Jerusalem, even rulers in all the provinces beyond the River, and that tribute, custom, and toll were given to them."
Ezra,4,21,"Now issue a decree to make those men stop, that this city may not be rebuilt until a decree is issued by me."
Ezra,4,22,And beware of being negligent in doing this matter; why should harm increase to damage the kings?”
Ezra,4,23,"Then as soon as the copy of King Artaxerxes’ document was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their colleagues, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews and stopped them by force and military."
Ezra,4,24,"Then the work on the house of God in Jerusalem stopped, and it was stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia."
Ezra,5,1,"And the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them."
Ezra,5,2,Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and the prophets of God were with them supporting them.
Ezra,5,3,"At that time Tattenai, the governor of the province beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues came to them and spoke to them thus, “Who issued you a decree to rebuild this house and to complete this structure?”"
Ezra,5,4,Then we told them accordingly what the names of the men were who were rebuilding this building.
Ezra,5,5,"But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until a report could come to Darius, and then a document be returned concerning this."
Ezra,5,6,"This is the copy of the letter which Tattenai, the governor of the province beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and his colleagues the officials, who were beyond the River, sent to Darius the king."
Ezra,5,7,"They sent word to him in which it was written thus:
“To Darius the king, all peace."
Ezra,5,8,"Let it be known to the king that we have gone to the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, and it is being built with huge stones, and timber is being put within the walls; and that work is going on with all diligence and is succeeding in their hands."
Ezra,5,9,"Then we asked those elders and said to them thus, ‘Who issued you a decree to rebuild this house and to complete this structure?’"
Ezra,5,10,"And we also asked them their names in order to make known to you, and that we might write down the names of the men who were at their head."
Ezra,5,11,"Thus they responded with a word to us, saying,
‘We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and completed."
Ezra,5,12,"But because our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and took the people away into exile in Babylon."
Ezra,5,13,"However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God."
Ezra,5,14,"Also the gold and silver utensils of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and brought them to the temple of Babylon, these King Cyrus took out from the temple of Babylon, and they were given to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor."
Ezra,5,15,"He said to him, “Take these articles, go and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt in its place.”"
Ezra,5,16,"Then that Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem; and from then until now it is being rebuilt, and it is not yet finished.’"
Ezra,5,17,"So now if it seems good to the king, let a search be made in the king’s treasure house, which is there in Babylon, if it be that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to rebuild that house of God in Jerusalem; and let the king send to us his will concerning this matter.”"
Ezra,6,1,"Then King Darius issued a decree, and a search was made in the archives, where the treasures were deposited in Babylon."
Ezra,6,2,"And in Ecbatana in the fortress, which is in the province of Media, a scroll was found and there was written in it as follows:
“Memorandum"
Ezra,6,3,"In the first year of King Cyrus, Cyrus the king issued a decree:
‘Concerning the house of God in Jerusalem, let that house, the place where sacrifices are offered, be rebuilt and let its foundations be retained, its height being 60 cubits and its width 60 cubits"
Ezra,6,4,with three layers of huge stones and one layer of timbers. And let the cost be given from the royal treasury.
Ezra,6,5,"And also let the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be returned and brought to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; and you shall deposit them in the house of God.’"
Ezra,6,6,"“Now Tattenai, governor of the province beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues, the officials of the provinces beyond the River, keep away from there."
Ezra,6,7,Leave that work on the house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild that house of God in its designated place.
Ezra,6,8,"Moreover, I issue a decree concerning what you shall do for those elders of Judah in the rebuilding of that house of God: the full cost is to be given to those people from the royal treasury out of the tribute of the provinces beyond the River, and that without negligence."
Ezra,6,9,"Whatever is needed, both young bulls, rams, and lambs for a burnt offering to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine, and anointing oil, according to what the priests in Jerusalem say, it is to be given to them daily without negligence"
Ezra,6,10,that they may bring sweet-smelling sacrifices near to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
Ezra,6,11,"And I issued a decree that any man who violates this edict, a timber shall be pulled out from his house and he shall be impaled on it and his house shall be made a refuse heap on account of this."
Ezra,6,12,"May the God who has caused His name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who stretches out his hand to change it, so as to destroy that house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued this decree, let it be done with all diligence!”"
Ezra,6,13,"Then Tattenai, the governor of the province beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues carried out the decree with all diligence, just as King Darius had sent."
Ezra,6,14,"And the elders of the Jews were building and succeeding through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. So they built and completed it according to the decree of the God of Israel and the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia."
Ezra,6,15,And this house was brought to completion on the third day of the month Adar; it was the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
Ezra,6,16,"And the sons of Israel, the priests, the Levites and the rest of the exiles, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy."
Ezra,6,17,"They brought near for the dedication of this house of God 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel 12 male goats, corresponding to the number of the tribes of Israel."
Ezra,6,18,"Then they appointed the priests to their sections and the Levites in their divisions for the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses."
Ezra,6,19,And the exiles celebrated the Passover on the fourteenth of the first month.
Ezra,6,20,"For the priests and the Levites had cleansed themselves together; all of them were clean. Then they slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, both for their brothers the priests and for themselves."
Ezra,6,21,"Then the sons of Israel who returned from exile and all those who had separated themselves from the uncleanness of the nations of the land to join them, to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, ate the Passover."
Ezra,6,22,"And they celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with gladness, for Yahweh had caused them to be glad and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them to strengthen them in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel."
Ezra,7,1,"Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, there went up Ezra son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah"
Ezra,7,2,"son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub"
Ezra,7,3,"son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth"
Ezra,7,4,"son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki"
Ezra,7,5,"son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the chief priest."
Ezra,7,6,"This Ezra went up from Babylon, and he was a scribe skilled in the law of Moses, which Yahweh, the God of Israel had given; and the king granted him all he requested because the hand of Yahweh his God was upon him."
Ezra,7,7,"And some of the sons of Israel and some of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes."
Ezra,7,8,"He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king."
Ezra,7,9,"For on the first of the first month he began to go up from Babylon; and on the first of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, because the good hand of his God was upon him."
Ezra,7,10,"For Ezra had set his heart to study the law of Yahweh and to practice it, and to teach His statute and judgment in Israel."
Ezra,7,11,"Now this is the copy of the letter which King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, learned in the words of the commandments of Yahweh and His statutes to Israel"
Ezra,7,12,"“Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace. And now"
Ezra,7,13,"I have issued a decree that any of the people of Israel and their priests and the Levites in my kingdom who freely offer to go to Jerusalem, may go with you."
Ezra,7,14,Forasmuch as you are sent from before the king and his seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God which is in your hand
Ezra,7,15,"and to bring the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem"
Ezra,7,16,"and all the silver and gold which you find in the whole province of Babylon, along with the freewill offering of the people and of the priests, who offered willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem"
Ezra,7,17,"with this money, therefore, you shall with all diligence buy bulls, rams, and lambs, with their grain offerings and their drink offerings, and bring them near to the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,18,"And whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold, you may do according to the will of your God."
Ezra,7,19,"Also the utensils which are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem."
Ezra,7,20,"The rest of the needs for the house of your God, which may fall upon you to provide, provide for it from the royal treasury."
Ezra,7,21,"“So I, even I, King Artaxerxes, issue a decree to all the treasurers who are in the provinces beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, may ask of you, it shall be done with all diligence"
Ezra,7,22,"even up to 100 talents of silver, 100 kors of wheat, 100 baths of wine, 100 baths of oil, and salt without written order."
Ezra,7,23,"Whatever is decreed by the God of heaven, let it be done with zeal for the house of the God of heaven, so that there will not be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons."
Ezra,7,24,"We also make known to you that it is not allowed to impose tribute, custom, or toll on any of the priests, Levites, singers, doorkeepers, temple servants, or other servants of this house of God."
Ezra,7,25,"“And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God which is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges that they may judge all the people who are in the province beyond the River, even all those who know the laws of your God; and to anyone who does not know the laws, you shall make them known."
Ezra,7,26,"Whoever will not do the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be done to him with all diligence, whether for death or for banishment or for confiscation of goods or for imprisonment.”"
Ezra,7,27,"Blessed be Yahweh, the God of our fathers, who has put such a thing as this in the king’s heart, to beautify the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem"
Ezra,7,28,"and has extended lovingkindness to me before the king and his counselors and before all the king’s mighty princes. Thus I was strengthened according to the hand of Yahweh my God upon me, and I gathered chief men from Israel to go up with me."
Ezra,8,1,Now these are the heads of their fathers’ households and the genealogical records of those who went up with me from Babylon in the reign of King Artaxerxes
Ezra,8,2,"of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom;
of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel;
of the sons of David, Hattush"
Ezra,8,3,"of the sons of Shecaniah who was of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah and with him 150 males who were in the genealogical records"
Ezra,8,4,"of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah and 200 males with him"
Ezra,8,5,"of the sons of Zattu, Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel and 300 males with him"
Ezra,8,6,"and of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan and 50 males with him"
Ezra,8,7,"and of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah and 70 males with him"
Ezra,8,8,"and of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael and 80 males with him"
Ezra,8,9,"of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel and 218 males with him"
Ezra,8,10,"and of the sons of Bani, Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah and 160 males with him"
Ezra,8,11,"and of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai and 28 males with him"
Ezra,8,12,"and of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan and 110 males with him"
Ezra,8,13,"and of the sons of Adonikam, the last ones, these being their names, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and 60 males with them"
Ezra,8,14,"and of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai, and Zabbud, and 70 males with them."
Ezra,8,15,"Now I gathered them at the river that runs to Ahava, where we camped for three days. And I observed the people and the priests, but I did not find any Levites there."
Ezra,8,16,"So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, chief men, and for Joiarib and Elnathan, teachers."
Ezra,8,17,"I sent them out to Iddo the chief man at the place Casiphia; and I put words in their mouths to say to Iddo and his brothers, the temple servants at the place Casiphia, that is, to bring ministers to us for the house of our God."
Ezra,8,18,"So, according to the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a man of insight of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, namely Sherebiah, and his sons and brothers, 18 men"
Ezra,8,19,"and Hashabiah and Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, 20 men"
Ezra,8,20,"and 220 of the temple servants, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, all of them designated by name."
Ezra,8,21,"Then I called for a fast there at the river of Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from Him a direct journey for us, our little ones, and all our possessions."
Ezra,8,22,"For I was ashamed to ask from the king for a military force and horsemen to help us against the enemy on the way, because we had said to the king, “The hand of our God is upon all those who seek Him, for their good, but His strength and His anger are against all those who forsake Him.”"
Ezra,8,23,"So we fasted and sought our God concerning this matter, and He was moved by our entreaty."
Ezra,8,24,"Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them ten of their brothers"
Ezra,8,25,"and I weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the utensils, the contribution for the house of our God which the king and his counselors and his princes and all Israel present there had offered."
Ezra,8,26,"Thus I weighed into their hands 650 talents of silver, and silver utensils worth 100 talents, and 100 gold talents"
Ezra,8,27,"and 20 gold bowls worth 1,000 darics, and two utensils of fine shiny bronze, precious as gold."
Ezra,8,28,"Then I said to them, “You are holy to Yahweh, and the utensils are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to Yahweh, the God of your fathers."
Ezra,8,29,"Watch and keep them until you weigh them before the officials of the priests, the Levites and the officials of the fathers’ households of Israel at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Yahweh.”"
Ezra,8,30,"So the priests and the Levites accepted the weighed out silver and gold and the utensils, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God."
Ezra,8,31,"Then we set out from the river Ahava on the twelfth of the first month to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the ambushes by the way."
Ezra,8,32,Thus we came to Jerusalem and remained there three days.
Ezra,8,33,"On the fourth day the silver and the gold and the utensils were weighed out in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them were the Levites, Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui."
Ezra,8,34,"Everything was numbered and weighed, and all the weight was written down at that time."
Ezra,8,35,"The exiles who had come from the captivity brought burnt offerings near to the God of Israel: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, 12 male goats for a sin offering, all as a burnt offering to Yahweh."
Ezra,8,36,"Then they gave the king’s edicts to the king’s satraps and to the governors in the provinces beyond the River, and they supported the people and the house of God."
Ezra,9,1,"Now when these things had been completed, the princes approached me, saying, “The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, according to their abominations, those of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians and the Amorites."
Ezra,9,2,"For they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed has intermingled with the peoples of the lands; indeed, the hands of the princes and the officials have been foremost in this unfaithfulness.”"
Ezra,9,3,"When I heard about this matter, I tore my garment and my robe, and pulled some of the hair from my head and my beard, and sat down in consternation."
Ezra,9,4,"Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel on account of the unfaithfulness of the exiles gathered to me, and I sat appalled until the evening offering."
Ezra,9,5,"But at the evening offering I arose from my affliction, even with my garment and my robe torn, and I fell on my knees and stretched out my hands to Yahweh my God"
Ezra,9,6,"and I said, “O my God, I am ashamed and humiliated to lift up my face to You, my God, for our iniquities have multiplied above our heads and our guilt has become great even to the heavens."
Ezra,9,7,"Since the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great guilt, and on account of our iniquities we, our kings and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder and to open shame, as it is this day."
Ezra,9,8,"But now for a brief moment grace has been shown from Yahweh our God, to leave us an escaped remnant and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our slavery."
Ezra,9,9,"For we are slaves; yet in our slavery our God has not forsaken us, but has extended lovingkindness to us before the kings of Persia, to give us reviving to raise up the house of our God, to restore its waste places, and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem."
Ezra,9,10,"“So now, our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commandments"
Ezra,9,11,"which You have commanded by the hand of Your slaves the prophets, saying, ‘The land which you are entering to possess is an impure land with the impurity of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations which have filled it from end to end, and with their uncleanness."
Ezra,9,12,"So now do not give your daughters to their sons nor take their daughters to your sons, and never seek their peace or their prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it as a possession to your sons forever.’"
Ezra,9,13,"After all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and our great guilt, since You our God have requited us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us an escaped remnant as this"
Ezra,9,14,"shall we again break Your commandments and intermarry with the peoples who commit these abominations? Would You not be angry with us to the point of destruction, until there is no remnant nor any who escape?"
Ezra,9,15,"O Yahweh, the God of Israel, You are righteous, for we have been left an escaped remnant, as it is this day; behold, we are before You in our guilt, for no one can stand before You because of this.”"
Ezra,10,1,"Now while Ezra was praying and making confession, weeping and prostrating himself before the house of God, a very large assembly, men, women, and children, gathered to him from Israel; for the people wept bitterly."
Ezra,10,2,"And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope for Israel in spite of this."
Ezra,10,3,"So now let us cut a covenant with our God to put away all the wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law."
Ezra,10,4,"Arise! For this matter is your responsibility, but we will be with you; be strong and act.”"
Ezra,10,5,"Then Ezra arose and made the leading priests, the Levites and all Israel, swear an oath that they would do according to this word; so they swore an oath."
Ezra,10,6,"Then Ezra arose from before the house of God and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib. He went there, but he did not eat bread nor drink water, for he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles."
Ezra,10,7,"And they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the exiles, that they should gather at Jerusalem"
Ezra,10,8,"and that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the prince and the elders, all his possessions should be devoted to destruction and he himself separated from the assembly of the exiles."
Ezra,10,9,"So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered at Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month on the twentieth of the month, and all the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and the heavy rain."
Ezra,10,10,"Then Ezra the priest arose and said to them, “You have been unfaithful and have married foreign wives adding to the guilt of Israel."
Ezra,10,11,"So now, make confession to Yahweh, the God of your fathers, and do His will; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives.”"
Ezra,10,12,"Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, “This is so! As you have said, so it is our duty to do."
Ezra,10,13,"But there are many people; it is the rainy season, and we are not able to stand outside. Nor can the task be done in one or two days, for we have transgressed greatly in this matter."
Ezra,10,14,"Let our princes stand in for the whole assembly, and let all those in our cities who have married foreign wives come at set times, together with the elders and judges of each city, until the burning anger of our God on account of this matter is turned away from us.”"
Ezra,10,15,"However, Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood against this, with Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helping them."
Ezra,10,16,"But the exiles did so. And Ezra the priest separated out men who were heads of fathers’ households for each of their father’s households, all of them by name. So they convened on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter."
Ezra,10,17,And they completed investigating all the men who had married foreign wives by the first day of the first month.
Ezra,10,18,"Among the sons of the priests who had married foreign wives were found of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah."
Ezra,10,19,"They gave their hand in pledge to put away their wives, and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt."
Ezra,10,20,Of the sons of Immer there were Hanani and Zebadiah
Ezra,10,21,"and of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel and Uzziah"
