Joshua,1,1,"Now it came about after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ attendant, saying"
Joshua,1,2,"“Moses My servant is dead; so now arise, cross this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel."
Joshua,1,3,"Every place on which the sole of your foot treads, I have given it to you, just as I spoke to Moses."
Joshua,1,4,"From the wilderness and this Lebanon, even as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun will be your territory."
Joshua,1,5,"No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you; I will not fail you or forsake you."
Joshua,1,6,"Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them."
Joshua,1,7,"Only be strong and very courageous to be careful to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn aside from it to the right or to the left, so that you may be prosperous wherever you go."
Joshua,1,8,"This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way successful, and then you will be prosperous."
Joshua,1,9,"Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous! Do not be in dread or be dismayed, for Yahweh your God is with you wherever you go.”"
Joshua,1,10,"Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying"
Joshua,1,11,"“Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you are to cross this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God is giving you, to possess it.’ ”"
Joshua,1,12,"To the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said"
Joshua,1,13,"“Remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, saying, ‘Yahweh your God gives you rest and will give you this land.’"
Joshua,1,14,"Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but you shall cross before your brothers in battle array, all your valiant warriors, and shall help them"
Joshua,1,15,"until Yahweh gives your brothers rest as He gives you, and they also possess the land which Yahweh your God is giving them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession and possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan to the east toward the sunrise.”"
Joshua,1,16,"And they answered Joshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go."
Joshua,1,17,"Just as we listened to Moses in all things, so we will listen to you; only may Yahweh your God be with you as He was with Moses."
Joshua,1,18,"Anyone who rebels against your command and does not listen to your words, in all that you command him, shall be put to death; only be strong and courageous.”"
Joshua,2,1,"Then Joshua the son of Nun sent two men as spies secretly from Shittim, saying, “Go, see the land, especially Jericho.” So they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab and lodged there."
Joshua,2,2,"And it was told to the king of Jericho, saying, “Behold, men from the sons of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land.”"
Joshua,2,3,"And the king of Jericho sent word to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land.”"
Joshua,2,4,"But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them, and she said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from."
Joshua,2,5,"Now it happened when it was time to shut the gate at dark, that the men went out; I do not know where the men went. Pursue them quickly, for you may overtake them.”"
Joshua,2,6,But she had brought them up to the roof and concealed them in the stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof.
Joshua,2,7,"So the men pursued them on the road to the Jordan to the fords; and as soon as those who were pursuing them had gone out, they shut the gate."
Joshua,2,8,"Now before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof"
Joshua,2,9,"and said to the men, “I know that Yahweh has given you the land, and that the terror of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted away before you."
Joshua,2,10,"For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you devoted to destruction."
Joshua,2,11,"Indeed we heard it, and our hearts melted, and a courageous spirit no longer rose up in any man because of you; for Yahweh your God, He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath."
Joshua,2,12,"So now, please swear to me by Yahweh, since I have shown lovingkindness to you, that you also will show lovingkindness to my father’s household and give me a pledge of truth"
Joshua,2,13,"and preserve my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters alive, with all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death.”"
Joshua,2,14,"So the men said to her, “Our life for yours if you do not tell this business of ours; and it will be when Yahweh gives us the land that we will show lovingkindness and truth to you.”"
Joshua,2,15,"Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on the city wall, so that she was living on the wall."
Joshua,2,16,"And she said to them, “Go to the hill country, lest the pursuers reach you. And hide yourselves there for three days until the pursuers return. Then afterward you may go on your way.”"
Joshua,2,17,"And the men said to her, “We shall be free from this oath to you which you have made us swear"
Joshua,2,18,"unless, when we come into the land, you tie this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down, and gather to yourself into the house your father and your mother and your brothers and all your father’s household."
Joshua,2,19,"And it will be that anyone who goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his own head, and we shall be free; but anyone who is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head if a hand is laid on him."
Joshua,2,20,"But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be free from the oath which you have made us swear.”"
Joshua,2,21,"And she said, “According to your words, so be it.” So she sent them away, and they went; and she tied the scarlet cord in the window."
Joshua,2,22,And they went and came to the hill country and remained there for three days until the pursuers returned. The pursuers had sought them all along the road but had not found them.
Joshua,2,23,"Then the two men returned and came down from the hill country and crossed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and they recounted to him all that had happened to them."
Joshua,2,24,"And they said to Joshua, “Surely Yahweh has given all the land into our hands; moreover, all the inhabitants of the land have melted away before us.”"
Joshua,3,1,"Then Joshua rose early in the morning; and he and all the sons of Israel set out from Shittim and came to the Jordan, and they lodged there before they crossed."
Joshua,3,2,Now it happened that at the end of three days the officers went through the midst of the camp
Joshua,3,3,"and they commanded the people, saying, “When you see the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God with the Levitical priests carrying it, then you shall set out from your place and go after it."
Joshua,3,4,"However, there shall be between you and it a distance of about 2,000 cubits by measure. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you shall go, for you have not passed this way before.”"
Joshua,3,5,"Then Joshua said to the people, “Set yourselves apart as holy, for tomorrow Yahweh will do wondrous deeds among you.”"
Joshua,3,6,"And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, “Carry the ark of the covenant and cross over ahead of the people.” So they carried the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people."
Joshua,3,7,"Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “This day I will begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you."
Joshua,3,8,"Moreover, you shall command the priests who are carrying the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’ ”"
Joshua,3,9,"Then Joshua said to the sons of Israel, “Come near, and hear the words of Yahweh your God.”"
Joshua,3,10,"And Joshua said, “By this you shall know that the living God is among you, and that He will assuredly dispossess from before you the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivite, the Perizzite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, and the Jebusite."
Joshua,3,11,"Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over ahead of you into the Jordan."
Joshua,3,12,"So now, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe."
Joshua,3,13,"And it will be that when the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of Yahweh, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off, and the waters which are flowing down from above will stand in one heap.”"
Joshua,3,14,So it happened that when the people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan with the priests carrying the ark of the covenant before the people
Joshua,3,15,"and when those who carried the ark came into the Jordan, and the feet of the priests carrying the ark were dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the days of harvest)"
Joshua,3,16,"the waters which were flowing down from above stood and rose up in one heap, a great distance away at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those which were flowing down toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. So the people crossed opposite Jericho."
Joshua,3,17,And the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of Yahweh stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel crossed on dry ground until all the nation had completed crossing the Jordan.
Joshua,4,1,"Now it happened when all the nation had completed crossing the Jordan, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying"
Joshua,4,2,"“Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe"
Joshua,4,3,"and command them, saying, ‘Carry for yourselves twelve stones from here out of the middle of the Jordan, from the place where the priests’ feet are standing firm, and carry them over with you and lay them down in the lodging place where you will lodge tonight.’ ”"
Joshua,4,4,"So Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the sons of Israel, one man from each tribe"
Joshua,4,5,"and Joshua said to them, “Cross again before the ark of Yahweh your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you carry a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel"
Joshua,4,6,"in order that this would be a sign among you, so that when your children ask later, saying, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’"
Joshua,4,7,"then you shall say to them, ‘Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh; when it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.’ So these stones shall become a memorial to the sons of Israel forever.”"
Joshua,4,8,"Thus the sons of Israel did as Joshua commanded and carried twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, just as Yahweh spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel; and they carried them over with them to the lodging place and laid them down there."
Joshua,4,9,"But Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan at the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant were standing, and they are there to this day."
Joshua,4,10,"Now the priests who carried the ark were standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything was completed that Yahweh had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hurried and crossed."
Joshua,4,11,"And it happened when all the people had completed crossing, that the ark of Yahweh and the priests crossed before the people."
Joshua,4,12,"And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over in battle array before the sons of Israel, just as Moses had spoken to them"
Joshua,4,13,"about 40,000 equipped for war crossed for battle before Yahweh to the desert plains of Jericho."
Joshua,4,14,"On that day, Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel, so that they feared him, just as they had feared Moses all the days of his life."
Joshua,4,15,Then Yahweh said to Joshua
Joshua,4,16,“Command the priests who carry the ark of the testimony that they come up from the Jordan.”
Joshua,4,17,"So Joshua commanded the priests, saying, “Come up from the Jordan.”"
Joshua,4,18,"So it happened when the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of Yahweh had come up from the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up to the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and went over all its banks as before."
Joshua,4,19,Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth of the first month and camped at Gilgal on the eastern edge of Jericho.
Joshua,4,20,"And those twelve stones which they had taken from the Jordan, Joshua set up at Gilgal."
Joshua,4,21,"Then he said to the sons of Israel, “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones mean?’"
Joshua,4,22,"then you shall make your children know, saying, ‘Israel crossed this Jordan on dry land.’"
Joshua,4,23,"For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed, just as Yahweh your God had done to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed"
Joshua,4,24,"that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of Yahweh is strong, so that you may fear Yahweh your God forever.”"
Joshua,5,1,"Now it happened when all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard how Yahweh had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the sons of Israel until they had crossed, that their hearts melted, and there was no spirit in them any longer because of the sons of Israel."
Joshua,5,2,"At that time Yahweh said to Joshua, “Make for yourself flint knives and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time.”"
Joshua,5,3,So Joshua made himself flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.
Joshua,5,4,"Now this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the people who came out of Egypt who were males, all the men of war, died in the wilderness along the way when they came out of Egypt."
Joshua,5,5,"For all the people who came out were circumcised, but all the people who were born in the wilderness along the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised."
Joshua,5,6,"For the sons of Israel had walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, that is, the men of war who came out of Egypt, were completely destroyed because they did not listen to the voice of Yahweh, to whom Yahweh had sworn that He would not let them see the land which Yahweh had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Joshua,5,7,"And their sons whom He raised up in their place, Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them along the way."
Joshua,5,8,"Now it happened that when they had completed circumcising all the nation, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed."
Joshua,5,9,"Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” So the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day."
Joshua,5,10,Then the sons of Israel camped at Gilgal and celebrated the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month on the desert plains of Jericho.
Joshua,5,11,"And on the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate some of the yield of the land, unleavened cakes and roasted grain."
Joshua,5,12,"Then the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten some of the produce of the land, so that the sons of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate some of the produce of the land of Canaan during that year."
Joshua,5,13,"Now it happened when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand, and Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us or for our adversaries?”"
Joshua,5,14,"He said, “No! Rather I indeed come now as commander of the host of Yahweh.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and bowed down and said to him, “What has my lord to say to his slave?”"
Joshua,5,15,"The commander of the host of Yahweh said to Joshua, “Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so."
Joshua,6,1,"Now Jericho was tightly shut because of the sons of Israel; no one went out, and no one came in."
Joshua,6,2,"And Yahweh said to Joshua, “See, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and the valiant warriors."
Joshua,6,3,"And you shall march around the city, all the men of war circling the city once. You shall do so for six days."
Joshua,6,4,"Also seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark; then on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets."
Joshua,6,5,"And it will be that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down beneath itself, and the people will go up every man straight ahead.”"
Joshua,6,6,"So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Carry the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of Yahweh.”"
Joshua,6,7,"Then he said to the people, “Go forward, and march around the city, and let the armed men go on before the ark of Yahweh.”"
Joshua,6,8,"And so it happened that, when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before Yahweh passed on forward and blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came after them."
Joshua,6,9,"And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while they continued to blow the trumpets."
Joshua,6,10,"But Joshua commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout nor let your voice be heard nor let a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you, ‘Shout!’ Then you shall shout!”"
Joshua,6,11,"So he had the ark of Yahweh taken around the city, circling it once; then they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp."
Joshua,6,12,"Then Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests carried the ark of Yahweh."
Joshua,6,13,"And the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually and blew the trumpets; and the armed men went before them, and the rear guard came after the ark of Yahweh, and they continued to blow the trumpets."
Joshua,6,14,Thus the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp; they did so for six days.
Joshua,6,15,Then it happened that on the seventh day they rose early at the breaking of dawn and marched around the city in the same manner seven times; only on that day they marched around the city seven times.
Joshua,6,16,"Now it happened that on the seventh time, the priests blew the trumpets, and Joshua said to the people, “Shout! For Yahweh has given you the city."
Joshua,6,17,"And the city shall be devoted to destruction, it and all that is in it belongs to Yahweh; only Rahab the harlot and all who are with her in the house shall live because she hid the messengers whom we sent."
Joshua,6,18,"But as for you, only keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction, lest as you are devoting them to destruction, you also take some of the things devoted to destruction and make the camp of Israel devoted to destruction and bring trouble on it."
Joshua,6,19,But all the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron are holy to Yahweh; they shall go into the treasury of Yahweh.”
Joshua,6,20,"So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets; and when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down beneath itself, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight ahead, and they took the city."
Joshua,6,21,"And they devoted to destruction everything in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword."
Joshua,6,22,"Now to the two men who had spied out the land, Joshua said, “Go into the harlot’s house and bring the woman and all she has out of there, as you have sworn to her.”"
Joshua,6,23,So the young men who were spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brothers and all she had; they also brought out all her relatives and placed them outside the camp of Israel.
Joshua,6,24,"But they burned the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only the silver and gold, and articles of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Yahweh."
Joshua,6,25,"However, Rahab the harlot and her father’s household and all she had, Joshua preserved alive; and she has lived in the midst of Israel to this day, for she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho."
Joshua,6,26,"Then Joshua made them swear an oath at that time, saying, “Cursed before Yahweh is the man who rises up and builds this city Jericho; with the loss of his firstborn he shall lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son he shall set up its gates.”"
Joshua,6,27,"So Yahweh was with Joshua, and the report about him was in all the land."
Joshua,7,1,"But the sons of Israel acted unfaithfully in regard to the things devoted to destruction. Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things; therefore the anger of Yahweh burned against the sons of Israel."
Joshua,7,2,"Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, “Go up and spy out the land.” So the men went up and spied out Ai."
Joshua,7,3,"Then they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not have all the people go up; only about two or three thousand men need go up to strike down Ai; do not have all the people toil up there, for they are few.”"
Joshua,7,4,"So about three thousand men from the people went up there, but they fled from the men of Ai."
Joshua,7,5,"And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of their men and pursued them from the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them down on the descent, so the hearts of the people melted and became as water."
Joshua,7,6,"Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, both he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads."
Joshua,7,7,"Joshua said, “Alas, O Lord Yahweh, why did You ever bring this people over the Jordan, only to give us into the hand of the Amorites, to make us perish? If only we had been willing to live beyond the Jordan!"
Joshua,7,8,"O Lord, what can I say since Israel has turned their back before their enemies?"
Joshua,7,9,"And the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will You do for Your great name?”"
Joshua,7,10,"So Yahweh said to Joshua, “Rise up! Why is it that you have fallen on your face?"
Joshua,7,11,"Israel has sinned, and they have also trespassed against My covenant which I commanded them. And they have even taken some of the things devoted to destruction and have both stolen and dealt falsely. Moreover, they have also put them among their own things."
Joshua,7,12,"Therefore the sons of Israel cannot rise before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, for they have become devoted to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy the things devoted to destruction from your midst."
Joshua,7,13,"Rise up! Set the people apart as holy and say, ‘Set yourselves apart as holy for tomorrow, for thus Yahweh, the God of Israel, has said, “There are things devoted to destruction in your midst, O Israel. You cannot rise before your enemies until you have removed the things devoted to destruction from your midst.”"
Joshua,7,14,"In the morning then you shall come near by your tribes. And it will be that the tribe which Yahweh takes by lot shall come near by families, and the family which Yahweh takes shall come near by households, and the household which Yahweh takes shall come near man by man."
Joshua,7,15,"And it will be that the one who is taken with the things devoted to destruction shall be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he has trespassed against the covenant of Yahweh, and because he has committed a disgraceful thing in Israel.’ ”"
Joshua,7,16,"So Joshua arose early in the morning and brought Israel near by tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken."
Joshua,7,17,"And he brought the family of Judah near, and he took the family of the Zerahites; and he brought the family of the Zerahites near man by man, and Zabdi was taken."
Joshua,7,18,"And he brought his household near man by man; and Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was taken."
Joshua,7,19,"Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, I implore you, give glory to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and give praise to Him; and declare to me now what you have done. Do not hide it from me.”"
Joshua,7,20,"So Achan answered Joshua and said, “Truly, I have sinned against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and this is what I did"
Joshua,7,21,"I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar and two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold fifty shekels in weight; then I coveted them and took them; and behold, they are concealed in the earth inside my tent with the silver underneath it.”"
Joshua,7,22,"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was concealed in his tent with the silver underneath it."
Joshua,7,23,"And they took them from inside the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the sons of Israel, and they poured them out before Yahweh."
Joshua,7,24,"Then Joshua and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the mantle, the bar of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that belonged to him; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor."
Joshua,7,25,"And Joshua said, “Why have you troubled us? Yahweh will trouble you this day.” And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones."
Joshua,7,26,"Then they raised over him a great heap of stones that stands to this day, and Yahweh turned from His burning anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called the valley of Achor to this day."
Joshua,8,1,"Now Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not fear or be dismayed. Take all the people of war with you and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land."
Joshua,8,2,So you shall do to Ai and its king just as you did to Jericho and its king; you shall take only its spoil and its cattle as plunder for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind it.”
Joshua,8,3,"So Joshua rose with all the people of war to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose 30,000 men, valiant warriors, and sent them out at night."
Joshua,8,4,"And he commanded them, saying, “See, you are going to ambush the city from behind it. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready."
Joshua,8,5,"Then I and all the people who are with me will come near the city. And it will be that when they come out to meet us as at the first, we will flee before them."
Joshua,8,6,"And they will come out after us until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, ‘They are fleeing before us as at the first.’ So we will flee before them."
Joshua,8,7,"And you shall rise from your ambush and take possession of the city, for Yahweh your God will give it into your hand."
Joshua,8,8,"Then it will be that when you have seized the city, that you shall set the city on fire. You shall do it according to the word of Yahweh. See, I have commanded you.”"
Joshua,8,9,"So Joshua sent them away, and they went to the place of ambush and remained between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua spent that night among the people."
Joshua,8,10,"Now Joshua rose early in the morning and mustered the people, and he went up with the elders of Israel before the people to Ai."
Joshua,8,11,Then all the people of war who were with him went up and drew near and arrived in front of the city and camped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him and Ai.
Joshua,8,12,"And he took about 5,000 men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city."
Joshua,8,13,"So they set the people, all the army that was on the north side of the city, and its rear guard on the west side of the city, and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley."
Joshua,8,14,"Now it happened that when the king of Ai saw it, the men of the city hurried and rose up early and went out to meet Israel in battle, he and all his people at the appointed place before the desert plain. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city."
Joshua,8,15,And Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them and fled by the way of the wilderness.
Joshua,8,16,"And all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city."
Joshua,8,17,"So not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel, and they forsook the city, leaving it open, and pursued Israel."
Joshua,8,18,"Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.” So Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city."
Joshua,8,19,"Then the men in ambush rose quickly from their place, and when he had stretched out his hand, they ran and entered the city and captured it, and they quickly set the city on fire."
Joshua,8,20,"Then the men of Ai turned back and looked, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended to the sky, and they had no place to flee this way or that, for the people who had been fleeing to the wilderness turned against the pursuers."
Joshua,8,21,But Joshua and all Israel saw that the men in ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city ascended. So they turned back and struck down the men of Ai.
Joshua,8,22,"And the others came out from the city to meet them, so that they were trapped in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side; and they struck them down until there was no one remaining for him who survived or escaped."
Joshua,8,23,But they seized the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
Joshua,8,24,"Now it happened that when Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the wilderness where they pursued them, and all of them fell by the edge of the sword until they were completely destroyed, then all Israel turned back to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword."
Joshua,8,25,"So all who fell that day, both men and women, were 12,000—all the people of Ai."
Joshua,8,26,For Joshua did not withdraw his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had devoted to destruction all the inhabitants of Ai.
Joshua,8,27,"Israel took only the cattle and the spoil of that city as plunder for themselves, according to the word of Yahweh which He had commanded Joshua."
Joshua,8,28,"So Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap forever, a desolation until this day."
Joshua,8,29,"And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening; and at sunset Joshua gave a command, and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the city gate and raised over it a great heap of stones that stands to this day."
Joshua,8,30,"Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal"
Joshua,8,31,"just as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones on which no man had wielded an iron tool; and they offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh and sacrificed peace offerings."
Joshua,8,32,"And he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written, in the presence of the sons of Israel."
Joshua,8,33,"And all Israel with their elders and officers and their judges were standing on both sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, the sojourner as well as the native. Half of them stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses the servant of Yahweh had given a command at first to bless the people of Israel."
Joshua,8,34,"Then afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law."
Joshua,8,35,There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel with the women and the little ones and the sojourners who were going among them.
Joshua,9,1,"Now it happened when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country and in the Shephelah and on all the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, heard of it"
Joshua,9,2,that they gathered themselves together with one accord to fight with Joshua and with Israel.
Joshua,9,3,Now the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai.
Joshua,9,4,"So they also acted craftily and went and traveled as envoys and took worn-out sacks on their donkeys, and wineskins worn-out and torn and mended"
Joshua,9,5,"and worn-out and patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes on themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry and was crumbled."
Joshua,9,6,"And they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country; so now, cut a covenant with us.”"
Joshua,9,7,"Then the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you are living within our land; how then shall we cut a covenant with you?”"
Joshua,9,8,"But they said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” Then Joshua said to them, “Who are you and where do you come from?”"
Joshua,9,9,"They said to him, “Your servants have come from a very far country because of the fame of Yahweh your God; for we have heard the report of Him and all that He did in Egypt"
Joshua,9,10,"and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan who was at Ashtaroth."
Joshua,9,11,"So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, ‘Take provisions in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them and say to them, “We are your servants; now then, cut a covenant with us.” ’"
Joshua,9,12,"This bread of ours was warm when we took it for our provisions out of our houses on the day that we left to come to you; but now behold, it is dry and has become crumbled."
Joshua,9,13,"And these wineskins which we filled were new, and behold, they are torn; and these clothes of ours and our sandals are worn out because of the very long journey.”"
Joshua,9,14,"So the men of Israel took some of their provisions, but they did not ask for the command of Yahweh."
Joshua,9,15,"And Joshua made peace with them and cut a covenant with them, to let them live; and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them."
Joshua,9,16,"Now it happened at the end of three days after they had cut a covenant with them, that they heard that they were near them and that they were living nearly among them."
Joshua,9,17,Then the sons of Israel set out and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon and Chephirah and Beeroth and Kiriath-jearim.
Joshua,9,18,But the sons of Israel did not strike them down because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh the God of Israel. And the whole congregation grumbled against the leaders.
Joshua,9,19,"Then all the leaders said to the whole congregation, “We have sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel, so now we cannot touch them."
Joshua,9,20,"This we will do to them, even let them live, so that wrath will not be upon us for the oath which we swore to them.”"
Joshua,9,21,"So the leaders said to them, “Let them live.” Thus they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the whole congregation, just as the leaders had spoken to them."
Joshua,9,22,"Then Joshua called for them and spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying, ‘We are very far from you,’ when you are living nearly in the midst of us?"
Joshua,9,23,"So now, you are cursed, and you shall never be cut loose from being slaves, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.”"
Joshua,9,24,"So they answered Joshua and said, “Because it was certainly told to your slaves that Yahweh your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you; therefore we feared greatly for our lives because of you and have done this thing."
Joshua,9,25,"So now, behold, we are in your hands; do as it seems good and right in your sight to do to us.”"
Joshua,9,26,"Thus he did to them and delivered them from the hands of the sons of Israel, and they did not kill them."
Joshua,9,27,"But Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day, in the place which He would choose."
Joshua,10,1,"Now it happened that when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai and had devoted it to destruction (just as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king), and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were within their land"
Joshua,10,2,"they feared exceedingly because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty."
Joshua,10,3,"Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham king of Hebron and to Piram king of Jarmuth and to Japhia king of Lachish and to Debir king of Eglon, saying"
Joshua,10,4,"“Come up to me and help me, and let us strike Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel.”"
Joshua,10,5,"So the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they with all their armies, and camped by Gibeon and fought against it."
Joshua,10,6,"Then the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, saying, “Do not abandon your slaves; come up to us quickly and save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites that live in the hill country have assembled against us.”"
Joshua,10,7,"So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him and all the valiant warriors."
Joshua,10,8,"And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hands; not one of them shall stand before you.”"
Joshua,10,9,"So Joshua came upon them suddenly—he had gone up, marching all night from Gilgal."
Joshua,10,10,"And Yahweh threw them into confusion before Israel, and He struck them with a great slaughter at Gibeon and pursued them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah."
Joshua,10,11,"Now it happened as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that Yahweh threw down large stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died; there were more who died from the hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel killed with the sword."
Joshua,10,12,"Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh in the day when Yahweh gave over the Amorites before the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel,
“O sun, stand still at Gibeon,
And O moon in the valley of Aijalon.”"
Joshua,10,13,"So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped,
Until the nation avenged themselves of their enemies.
Is it not written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stood in the middle of the sky and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day."
Joshua,10,14,"And there was no day like that before it or after it, when Yahweh listened to the voice of a man; for Yahweh fought for Israel."
Joshua,10,15,Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp to Gilgal.
Joshua,10,16,And these five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
Joshua,10,17,"Then it was told Joshua, saying, “The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.”"
Joshua,10,18,"And Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave and assign men by it to keep watch over them"
Joshua,10,19,"but as for you, do not stand there; pursue your enemies and attack them in the rear. Do not allow them to enter their cities, for Yahweh your God has given them into your hand.”"
Joshua,10,20,"Now it happened when Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished striking them with a very great slaughter until they were completely destroyed, and the survivors—those of them who survived—had entered the fortified cities"
Joshua,10,21,that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. No one so much as lifted his tongue against any of the sons of Israel.
Joshua,10,22,"Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring these five kings out to me from the cave.”"
Joshua,10,23,"And they did so and brought these five kings out to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon."
Joshua,10,24,"Now it happened that when they brought these kings out to Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came near and put their feet on their necks."
Joshua,10,25,"Joshua then said to them, “Do not fear or be dismayed! Be strong and courageous, for thus Yahweh will do to all your enemies with whom you fight.”"
Joshua,10,26,"So afterward Joshua struck them and put them to death, and he hanged them on five trees; and they hung on the trees until evening."
Joshua,10,27,"Now it happened that at sunset Joshua gave a command, and they took them down from the trees and threw them down into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and they put large stones over the mouth of the cave, to this very day."
Joshua,10,28,Now Joshua captured Makkedah on that day and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword; he devoted it to destruction and every person who was in it. He left no survivor. Thus he did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho.
Joshua,10,29,Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against Libnah.
Joshua,10,30,"And Yahweh gave it also with its king into the hands of Israel, and he struck it and every person who was in it with the edge of the sword. He left no survivor remaining in it. Thus he did to its king just as he had done to the king of Jericho."
Joshua,10,31,"And Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to Lachish, and they camped by it and fought against it."
Joshua,10,32,"And Yahweh gave Lachish into the hands of Israel; and he captured it on the second day and struck it and every person who was in it with the edge of the sword, according to all that he had done to Libnah."
Joshua,10,33,"Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish, and Joshua struck him and his people down until there was no survivor remaining for him."
Joshua,10,34,"And Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to Eglon, and they camped by it and fought against it."
Joshua,10,35,"And they captured it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword; and every person who was in it, he devoted to destruction on that day according to all that he had done to Lachish."
Joshua,10,36,"Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron, and they fought against it."
Joshua,10,37,"And they captured it and struck it and its king and all its cities and all the persons who were in it with the edge of the sword. He left no survivor remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon. And he devoted it and every person who was in it to destruction."
Joshua,10,38,"Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to Debir, and they fought against it."
Joshua,10,39,"And he captured it and its king and all its cities, and they struck them with the edge of the sword and devoted every person who was in it to destruction. He left no survivor remaining. Just as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king, as he had also done to Libnah and its king."
Joshua,10,40,"Thus Joshua struck all the land—the hill country and the Negev and the Shephelah and the slopes—as well as all their kings. He left no survivor remaining, but he devoted to destruction all who breathed, just as Yahweh, the God of Israel, had commanded."
Joshua,10,41,"And Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea even as far as Gaza, and all the country of Goshen even as far as Gibeon."
Joshua,10,42,"And Joshua captured all these kings and their lands at one time because Yahweh, the God of Israel, fought for Israel."
Joshua,10,43,So Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.
Joshua,11,1,"Now it happened, when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon and to the king of Shimron and to the king of Achshaph"
Joshua,11,2,and to the kings who were of the north in the hill country and in the Arabah—south of Chinneroth and in the Shephelah and on the heights of Dor on the west
Joshua,11,3,"to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpeh."
Joshua,11,4,"Then they came out, they and all their armies with them, as many people as the sand that is on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots."
Joshua,11,5,"So all of these kings agreed to meet, and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel."
Joshua,11,6,"Then Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid because of them, for tomorrow at this time I will give all of them over, slain, before Israel; you shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.”"
Joshua,11,7,"So Joshua and all the people of war with him came upon them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and they fell upon them."
Joshua,11,8,"And Yahweh gave them into the hand of Israel, so that they struck them down, and they pursued them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim and the valley of Mizpeh to the east; and they struck them until there was no survivor remaining for them."
Joshua,11,9,And Joshua did to them as Yahweh had said to him; he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
Joshua,11,10,Then Joshua turned back at that time and captured Hazor and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor formerly was the head of all these kingdoms.
Joshua,11,11,"And they struck every person who was in it with the edge of the sword, devoting them to destruction; there was no one left who breathed. And he burned Hazor with fire."
Joshua,11,12,"And Joshua captured all the cities of these kings and all their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, and he devoted them to destruction, just as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded."
Joshua,11,13,"However, Israel did not burn any cities that stood on their mounds, except Hazor alone, which Joshua burned."
Joshua,11,14,"Now all the spoil of these cities and the cattle, the sons of Israel took as their plunder; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them. They left no one remaining who breathed."
Joshua,11,15,"Just as Yahweh had commanded Moses His servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did; he left nothing undone of all that Yahweh had commanded Moses."
Joshua,11,16,"Thus Joshua took all that land: the hill country and all the Negev, all that land of Goshen, the Shephelah, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel and its Shephelah"
Joshua,11,17,"from Mount Halak, that rises toward Seir, even as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. And he captured all their kings and struck them down and put them to death."
Joshua,11,18,Joshua waged war a long time with all these kings.
Joshua,11,19,There was not a city which made peace with the sons of Israel except the Hivites living in Gibeon; they took them all in battle.
Joshua,11,20,"For it was of Yahweh to strengthen their hearts, to meet Israel in battle in order that he might devote them to destruction, that they might receive no mercy, but that he might destroy them, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses."
Joshua,11,21,"Then Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab and from all the hill country of Judah and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua devoted them to destruction with their cities."
Joshua,11,22,"There were no Anakim left in the land of the sons of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod some remained."
Joshua,11,23,"So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Yahweh had spoken to Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. Thus the land was quiet from war."
Joshua,12,1,"Now these are the kings of the land whom the sons of Israel struck down, and whose land they possessed beyond the Jordan to the east toward the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon as far as Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah to the east"
Joshua,12,2,"Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, both the middle of the valley and half of Gilead, even as far as the brook Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon"
Joshua,12,3,"and the Arabah as far as the Sea of Chinneroth toward the east, and as far as the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward toward Beth-jeshimoth, and on the south, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah"
Joshua,12,4,"and the territory of Og king of Bashan, one of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei"
Joshua,12,5,"and ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and all Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half of Gilead, as far as the border of Sihon king of Heshbon."
Joshua,12,6,Moses the servant of Yahweh and the sons of Israel struck them down; and Moses the servant of Yahweh gave it to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh as a possession.
Joshua,12,7,"Now these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the sons of Israel struck down beyond the Jordan toward the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even as far as Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir; and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their divisions"
Joshua,12,8,"in the hill country and in the Shephelah and in the Arabah and on the slopes and in the wilderness and in the Negev; the Hittite, the Amorite and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite"
Joshua,12,9,"the king of Jericho, one;
the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one"
Joshua,12,10,"the king of Jerusalem, one;
the king of Hebron, one"
Joshua,12,11,"the king of Jarmuth, one;
the king of Lachish, one"
Joshua,12,12,"the king of Eglon, one;
the king of Gezer, one"
Joshua,12,13,"the king of Debir, one;
the king of Geder, one"
Joshua,12,14,"the king of Hormah, one;
the king of Arad, one"
Joshua,12,15,"the king of Libnah, one;
the king of Adullam, one"
Joshua,12,16,"the king of Makkedah, one;
the king of Bethel, one"
Joshua,12,17,"the king of Tappuah, one;
the king of Hepher, one"
Joshua,12,18,"the king of Aphek, one;
the king of Lasharon, one"
Joshua,12,19,"the king of Madon, one;
the king of Hazor, one"
Joshua,12,20,"the king of Shimron-meron, one;
the king of Achshaph, one"
Joshua,12,21,"the king of Taanach, one;
the king of Megiddo, one"
Joshua,12,22,"the king of Kedesh, one;
the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one"
Joshua,12,23,"the king of Dor in the heights of Dor, one;
the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one"
Joshua,12,24,"the king of Tirzah, one:
in all, thirty-one kings."
Joshua,13,1,"Now Joshua was old, advanced in years, and Yahweh said to him, “You are old, advanced in years, and very much of the land remains to be possessed."
Joshua,13,2,This is the land that remains: all the regions of the Philistines and all those of the Geshurites
Joshua,13,3,"from the Shihor which is east of Egypt, even as far as the border of Ekron to the north (it is counted as Canaanite); the five lords of the Philistines: the Gazite, the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, the Ekronite; and the Avvite"
Joshua,13,4,"to the south, all the land of the Canaanite, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorite"
Joshua,13,5,"and the land of the Gebalite, and all of Lebanon, to the east toward the sunrise, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon as far as Lebo-hamath."
Joshua,13,6,"All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon as far as Misrephoth-maim, all the Sidonians, I will dispossess them from before the sons of Israel; only allot it to Israel for an inheritance as I have commanded you."
Joshua,13,7,"So now, apportion this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”"
Joshua,13,8,"With the other half-tribe, the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan to the east, just as Moses the servant of Yahweh gave to them"
Joshua,13,9,"from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba, as far as Dibon"
Joshua,13,10,"and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the border of the sons of Ammon"
Joshua,13,11,"and Gilead, and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah"
Joshua,13,12,"all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (he alone remained of the remnant of the Rephaim); for Moses struck them and dispossessed them."
Joshua,13,13,But the sons of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurites or the Maacathites; so Geshur and Maacath live among Israel until this day.
Joshua,13,14,"Only to the tribe of Levi he did not give an inheritance; the offerings by fire to Yahweh, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as He spoke to him."
Joshua,13,15,So Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their families.
Joshua,13,16,"And their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, with the city which is in the middle of the valley and all the plain by Medeba"
Joshua,13,17,"Heshbon, and all its cities which are on the plain: Dibon and Bamoth-baal and Beth-baal-meon"
Joshua,13,18,and Jahaz and Kedemoth and Mephaath
Joshua,13,19,and Kiriathaim and Sibmah and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley
Joshua,13,20,and Beth-peor and the slopes of Pisgah and Beth-jeshimoth
Joshua,13,21,"even all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck with the leaders of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land."
Joshua,13,22,"The sons of Israel also killed Balaam the son of Beor, the diviner, with the sword among the rest of their slain."
Joshua,13,23,"And the border of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, the cities and their villages."
Joshua,13,24,"Moses also gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad, according to their families."
Joshua,13,25,"And their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, as far as Aroer which is before Rabbah"
Joshua,13,26,"and from Heshbon as far as Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim as far as the border of Debir"
Joshua,13,27,"and in the valley, Beth-haram and Beth-nimrah and Succoth and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as a border, as far as the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan to the east."
Joshua,13,28,"This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families, the cities and their villages."
Joshua,13,29,Moses also gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh; and it was for the half-tribe of the sons of Manasseh according to their families.
Joshua,13,30,"And their territory was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all of Havvoth-jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities"
Joshua,13,31,"also half of Gilead, with Ashtaroth and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh, for half of the sons of Machir according to their families."
Joshua,13,32,"These are the territories which Moses apportioned for an inheritance in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho to the east."
Joshua,13,33,"But to the tribe of Levi, Moses did not give an inheritance; Yahweh, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as He had promised to them."
Joshua,14,1,"Now these are the territories which the sons of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the households of the tribes of the sons of Israel apportioned to them for an inheritance"
Joshua,14,2,"by the lot of their inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe."
Joshua,14,3,For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but he did not give an inheritance to the Levites among them.
Joshua,14,4,"For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and they did not give a portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to live in, with their pasture lands for their livestock and for their property."
Joshua,14,5,"Thus the sons of Israel did just as Yahweh had commanded Moses, and they divided the land."
Joshua,14,6,"Then the sons of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know the word which Yahweh spoke to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh-barnea."
Joshua,14,7,"I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought word back to him as it was in my heart."
Joshua,14,8,"Nevertheless, my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt with fear; but I followed Yahweh my God fully."
Joshua,14,9,"So Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘Surely the land on which your foot has trodden will be an inheritance to you and to your children forever because you have followed Yahweh my God fully.’"
Joshua,14,10,"So now behold, Yahweh has let me live, just as He spoke, these forty-five years, from the time that Yahweh spoke this word to Moses, when Israel walked in the wilderness; so now behold, I am eighty-five years old today."
Joshua,14,11,"I am still as strong today as I was in the day Moses sent me; as my strength was then, so my strength is now, for war and for going out and coming in."
Joshua,14,12,"So now, give me this hill country about which Yahweh spoke on that day, for you heard on that day that Anakim were there, with great fortified cities; perhaps Yahweh will be with me, and I will dispossess them as Yahweh has spoken.”"
Joshua,14,13,So Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
Joshua,14,14,"Therefore, Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite until this day because he fully followed Yahweh, the God of Israel."
Joshua,14,15,Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba; for Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim. Then the land was quiet from war.
Joshua,15,1,"Now the lot for the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families reached the border of Edom, southward to the wilderness of Zin at the far end toward the south."
Joshua,15,2,"And their south border was from the lower end of the Salt Sea, from the bay that turns to the south."
Joshua,15,3,Then it went out southward to the ascent of Akrabbim and passed on to Zin and went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea and continued to Hezron and went up to Addar and turned about to Karka.
Joshua,15,4,"And it passed on to Azmon and went out to the brook of Egypt, and the border ended at the sea. This shall be your south border."
Joshua,15,5,"And the east border was the Salt Sea, as far as the mouth of the Jordan. And the border of the north side was from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan."
Joshua,15,6,Then the border went up to Beth-hoglah and passed by on the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.
Joshua,15,7,"Then the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor and turned northward toward Gilgal which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south of the valley; and the border continued to the waters of En-shemesh and it ended at En-rogel."
Joshua,15,8,"Then the border went up the valley of Ben-hinnom to the slope of the Jebusite on the south (that is, Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain which is before the valley of Hinnom to the west, which is at the end of the valley of Rephaim toward the north."
Joshua,15,9,"From the top of the mountain the border curved to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah and proceeded to the cities of Mount Ephron; then the border curved to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim)."
Joshua,15,10,"Then the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir and continued to the slope of Mount Jearim on the north (that is, Chesalon) and went down to Beth-shemesh and continued through Timnah."
Joshua,15,11,"Then the border went out to the side of Ekron northward. Then the border curved to Shikkeron and passed on to Mount Baalah and went out to Jabneel, and the border ended at the sea."
Joshua,15,12,"And the west border was at the Great Sea, even its coastline. This is the border around the sons of Judah according to their families."
Joshua,15,13,"Now he gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the sons of Judah, according to the command of Yahweh to Joshua, namely, Kiriath-arba, Arba being the father of Anak (that is, Hebron)."
Joshua,15,14,"And Caleb dispossessed from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the children of Anak."
Joshua,15,15,Then he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir; now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher.
Joshua,15,16,"And Caleb said, “The one who strikes down Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah my daughter as a wife.”"
Joshua,15,17,"And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it; so he gave him Achsah his daughter as a wife."
Joshua,15,18,"Now it happened that when she came to him, she enticed him to ask her father for a field. So she alighted from the donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you want?”"
Joshua,15,19,"Then she said, “Give me a blessing; since you have given me the land of the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs."
Joshua,15,20,This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families.

Joshua,15,63,"Now as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the sons of Judah could not dispossess them; so the Jebusites live with the sons of Judah at Jerusalem until this day."
Joshua,16,1,"Then the lot for the sons of Joseph went out from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters of Jericho on the east into the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill country to Bethel."
Joshua,16,2,And it went out from Bethel to Luz and passed on to the border of the Archites at Ataroth.
Joshua,16,3,"Then it went down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, as far as the territory of lower Beth-horon even to Gezer, and it ended at the sea."
Joshua,16,4,"So the sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance."
Joshua,16,5,"Now this was the territory of the sons of Ephraim according to their families: the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth-addar, as far as upper Beth-horon."
Joshua,16,6,"Then the border went westward at Michmethath on the north, and the border turned about eastward to Taanath-shiloh and passed on beyond it to the east of Janoah."
Joshua,16,7,And it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah and reached Jericho and came out at the Jordan.
Joshua,16,8,"From Tappuah the border continued westward to the brook of Kanah, and it ended at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim according to their families"
Joshua,16,9,"together with the cities which were set apart for the sons of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages."
Joshua,16,10,"But they did not dispossess the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites live in the midst of Ephraim to this day, and they became forced laborers."
Joshua,17,1,"And this was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. To Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war."
Joshua,17,2,"So the lot was made for the rest of the sons of Manasseh according to their families: for the sons of Abiezer and for the sons of Helek and for the sons of Asriel and for the sons of Shechem and for the sons of Hepher and for the sons of Shemida; these were the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the males according to their families."
Joshua,17,3,"However, Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah."
Joshua,17,4,"And they came near before Eleazar the priest and before Joshua the son of Nun and before the leaders, saying, “Yahweh commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.” So according to the word of Yahweh he gave them an inheritance among their father’s brothers."
Joshua,17,5,"Thus there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan"
Joshua,17,6,because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
Joshua,17,7,And the border of Manasseh ran from Asher to Michmethath which was east of Shechem; then the border went southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
Joshua,17,8,"The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the sons of Ephraim."
Joshua,17,9,"And the border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook (these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh), and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and it ended at the sea."
Joshua,17,10,"The south side belonged to Ephraim and the north side to Manasseh, and the sea was their border; and they reached to Asher on the north and to Issachar on the east."
Joshua,17,11,"And in Issachar and in Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, the third is Napheth."
Joshua,17,12,But the sons of Manasseh could not take possession of these cities because the Canaanites persisted in living in that land.
Joshua,17,13,"Now it happened that when the sons of Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not dispossess them completely."
Joshua,17,14,"Then the sons of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, “Why have you given me only one lot and one portion for an inheritance, since I am a numerous people whom Yahweh has thus far blessed?”"
Joshua,17,15,"And Joshua said to them, “If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest and clear a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.”"
Joshua,17,16,"And the sons of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who live in the valley land have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth-shean and its towns and those who are in the valley of Jezreel.”"
Joshua,17,17,"Then Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, saying, “You are a numerous people and have great power; you shall not have one lot only"
Joshua,17,18,"but the hill country shall be yours. For though it is a forest, you shall clear it, and to its farthest borders it shall be yours; for you shall dispossess the Canaanites, even though they have chariots of iron and even though they are strong.”"
Joshua,18,1,Then the whole congregation of the sons of Israel assembled themselves at Shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there; and the land was subdued before them.
Joshua,18,2,And there remained among the sons of Israel seven tribes who had not divided their inheritance.
Joshua,18,3,"So Joshua said to the sons of Israel, “How long will you put off entering to take possession of the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has given you?"
Joshua,18,4,"Provide for yourselves three men from each tribe that I may send them, and that they may arise and walk through the land and write a description of it according to their inheritance; then they shall return to me."
Joshua,18,5,"And they shall divide it into seven portions; Judah shall stay in its territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall stay in their territory on the north."
Joshua,18,6,So you shall write a description of the land in seven divisions and bring the description here to me. I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh our God.
Joshua,18,7,"For the Levites have no portion among you because the priesthood of Yahweh is their inheritance. Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh also have received their inheritance eastward beyond the Jordan, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them.”"
Joshua,18,8,"Then the men arose and went, and Joshua commanded those who went to write the description of the land, saying, “Go and walk through the land and write a description of it, and return to me; then I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh in Shiloh.”"
Joshua,18,9,So the men went and passed through the land and wrote a description of it by cities in seven divisions in a book; and they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.
Joshua,18,10,"And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Yahweh, and there Joshua divided the land to the sons of Israel according to their divisions."
Joshua,18,11,"Now the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot lay between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph."
Joshua,18,12,"And their border on the north side was from the Jordan; then the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north and went up through the hill country westward, and it ended at the wilderness of Beth-aven."
Joshua,18,13,"From there the border passed on to Luz, to the side of Luz (that is, Bethel) southward; and the border went down to Ataroth-addar, near the hill which lies on the south of lower Beth-horon."
Joshua,18,14,"Then the border curved from there and turned round on the west side southward, from the hill which lies before Beth-horon southward; and it ended at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city of the sons of Judah. This was the west side."
Joshua,18,15,"Then the south side was from the edge of Kiriath-jearim, and the border went out westward and went out to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah."
Joshua,18,16,"Then the border went down to the edge of the hill which is in the valley of Ben-hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the slope of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel."
Joshua,18,17,"Then it curved northward and went out to En-shemesh and went out to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben."
Joshua,18,18,Then it continued to the side in front of the Arabah northward and went down to the Arabah.
Joshua,18,19,"And the border passed on to the side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the south border."
Joshua,18,20,"Moreover, the Jordan was its border on the east side. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, according to their families and according to its borders all around."
Joshua,18,21,Now the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho and Beth-hoglah and Emek-keziz
Joshua,18,22,and Beth-arabah and Zemaraim and Bethel
Joshua,18,23,and Avvim and Parah and Ophrah

Joshua,18,27,and Rekem and Irpeel and Taralah
Joshua,18,28,"and Zelah, Haeleph and the Jebusite (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin according to their families."
Joshua,19,1,"Then the second lot came out for Simeon, for the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families, and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Judah."
Joshua,19,2,So they had as their inheritance Beersheba or Sheba and Moladah
Joshua,19,3,and Hazar-shual and Balah and Ezem
Joshua,19,4,and Eltolad and Bethul and Hormah
Joshua,19,5,and Ziklag and Beth-marcaboth and Hazar-susah
Joshua,19,6,and Beth-lebaoth and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages
Joshua,19,7,"Ain, Rimmon and Ether and Ashan; four cities with their villages"
Joshua,19,8,"and all the villages which were around these cities as far as Baalath-beer, Ramah of the Negev. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families."
Joshua,19,9,"The inheritance of the sons of Simeon was taken from the portion of the sons of Judah, for the share of the sons of Judah was too large for them; so the sons of Simeon received an inheritance in the midst of Judah’s inheritance."
Joshua,19,10,Now the third lot came up for the sons of Zebulun according to their families. And the territory of their inheritance was as far as Sarid.
Joshua,19,11,Then their border went up to the west and to Maralah; it then reached Dabbesheth and reached the brook that is before Jokneam.
Joshua,19,12,"Then it turned from Sarid to the east toward the sunrise as far as the border of Chisloth-tabor, and it went out to Daberath and up to Japhia."
Joshua,19,13,"From there it passed on to the east toward the sunrise to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin, and it went out to Rimmon which curves to Neah."
Joshua,19,14,"And the border circled around it on the north to Hannathon, and it ended at the valley of Iphtahel."
Joshua,19,15,Included also were Kattah and Nahalal and Shimron and Idalah and Bethlehem; twelve cities with their villages.
Joshua,19,16,"This was the inheritance of the sons of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,17,"The fourth lot came out for Issachar, for the sons of Issachar according to their families."
Joshua,19,18,And their territory included Jezreel and Chesulloth and Shunem

Joshua,19,20,and Rabbith and Kishion and Ebez
Joshua,19,21,and Remeth and En-gannim and En-haddah and Beth-pazzez.
Joshua,19,22,"And the border reached to Tabor and Shahazumah and Beth-shemesh, and their border ended at the Jordan; sixteen cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,23,"This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Issachar according to their families, the cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,24,Now the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families.
Joshua,19,25,And their territory was Helkath and Hali and Beten and Achshaph
Joshua,19,26,and Allammelech and Amad and Mishal; and it reached to Carmel on the west and to Shihor-libnath.
Joshua,19,27,Then it turned east toward the sunrise to Beth-dagon and reached to Zebulun and to the valley of Iphtahel northward to Beth-emek and Neiel; then it went out to the north to Cabul
Joshua,19,28,"and Ebron and Rehob and Hammon and Kanah, as far as Great Sidon."
Joshua,19,29,"Then the border turned to Ramah and to the fortified city of Tyre; then the border turned to Hosah, and it ended at the sea by the region of Achzib."
Joshua,19,30,Included also were Ummah and Aphek and Rehob; twenty-two cities with their villages.
Joshua,19,31,"This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,32,"The sixth lot came out for the sons of Naphtali, for the sons of Naphtali according to their families."
Joshua,19,33,"And their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim and Adami-nekeb and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and it ended at the Jordan."
Joshua,19,34,Then the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor and went out from there to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south and reached to Asher on the west and to Judah at the Jordan to the east toward the sunrise.
Joshua,19,35,"Now the fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer and Hammath, Rakkath and Chinnereth"
Joshua,19,36,and Adamah and Ramah and Hazor

Joshua,19,38,"and Yiron and Migdal-el, Horem and Beth-anath and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,39,"This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali according to their families, the cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,40,The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families.

Joshua,19,45,and Jehud and Bene-berak and Gath-rimmon
Joshua,19,46,"and Me-jarkon and Rakkon, with the territory over against Joppa."
Joshua,19,47,And the territory of the sons of Dan went out from them; for the sons of Dan went up and fought with Leshem and captured it. Then they struck it with the edge of the sword and possessed it and settled in it; and they called Leshem Dan after the name of Dan their father.
Joshua,19,48,"This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages."
Joshua,19,49,So they finished apportioning the land for inheritance by its borders. Then the sons of Israel gave an inheritance in their midst to Joshua the son of Nun.
Joshua,19,50,"In accordance with the command of Yahweh they gave him the city for which he asked, Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim. So he built the city and settled in it."
Joshua,19,51,These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the households of the tribes of the sons of Israel distributed by lot in Shiloh before Yahweh at the doorway of the tent of meeting. So they finished dividing the land.
Joshua,20,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying"
Joshua,20,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘Designate the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you by the hand of Moses"
Joshua,20,3,"that the manslayer who strikes down any person unintentionally, without premeditation, may flee there, and they shall become for you as a refuge from the avenger of blood."
Joshua,20,4,"And he shall flee to one of these cities and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and speak his case in the hearing of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city to them and give him a place, so that he may live among them."
Joshua,20,5,"Now if the avenger of blood pursues him, then they shall not surrender the manslayer into his hand because he struck his neighbor without premeditation and did not hate him beforehand."
Joshua,20,6,"And he shall live in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the one who is high priest in those days. Then the manslayer shall return and come to his own city and to his own house, to the city from which he fled.’ ”"
Joshua,20,7,"So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah."
Joshua,20,8,"Now beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plain from the tribe of Reuben and Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh."
Joshua,20,9,"These were the appointed cities for all the sons of Israel and for the sojourner who sojourns among them, that whoever strikes down any person unintentionally may flee there and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood until he stands before the congregation."
Joshua,21,1,Then the heads of households of the Levites came near to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of households of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
Joshua,21,2,"And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, “Yahweh commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to live in, with their pasture lands for our cattle.”"
Joshua,21,3,"So the sons of Israel gave the Levites from their inheritance these cities with their pasture lands, according to the command of Yahweh."
Joshua,21,4,"Then the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. And the sons of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, received thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Judah and from the tribe of the Simeonites and from the tribe of Benjamin."
Joshua,21,5,Now the rest of the sons of Kohath received ten cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Ephraim and from the tribe of Dan and from the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua,21,6,"And the sons of Gershon received thirteen cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Issachar and from the tribe of Asher and from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan."
Joshua,21,7,The sons of Merari according to their families received twelve cities from the tribe of Reuben and from the tribe of Gad and from the tribe of Zebulun.
Joshua,21,8,"So the sons of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their pasture lands, as Yahweh had commanded by the hand of Moses."
Joshua,21,9,They also gave from the tribe of the sons of Judah and from the tribe of the sons of Simeon these cities which are here mentioned by name
Joshua,21,10,"and they were for the sons of Aaron, one of the families of the Kohathites, of the sons of Levi, for the lot was theirs first."
Joshua,21,11,"So they gave them Kiriath-arba (Arba being the father of Anak), that is, Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with its pasture lands all around it."
Joshua,21,12,But the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession.
Joshua,21,13,"Thus to the sons of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands, Libnah also with its pasture lands"
Joshua,21,14,"Jattir with its pasture lands, Eshtemoa with its pasture lands"
Joshua,21,15,"Holon with its pasture lands, and Debir with its pasture lands"
Joshua,21,16,"and Ain with its pasture lands, and Juttah with its pasture lands, and Beth-shemesh with its pasture lands; nine cities from these two tribes."
Joshua,21,17,"From the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its pasture lands, Geba with its pasture lands"
Joshua,21,18,Anathoth with its pasture lands and Almon with its pasture lands; four cities.
Joshua,21,19,"All the cities of the sons of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their pasture lands."
Joshua,21,20,"Then the cities from the tribe of Ephraim were allotted to the families of the sons of Kohath, the Levites, even to the rest of the sons of Kohath."
Joshua,21,21,"And they gave them Shechem, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands, in the hill country of Ephraim, and Gezer with its pasture lands"

Joshua,21,24,"Aijalon with its pasture lands, and Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands; four cities."
Joshua,21,25,"From the half-tribe of Manasseh, they gave Taanach with its pasture lands and Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands; two cities."
Joshua,21,26,All the cities with their pasture lands for the families of the rest of the sons of Kohath were ten.
Joshua,21,27,"Now to the sons of Gershon, one of the families of the Levites, from the half-tribe of Manasseh, they gave Golan in Bashan, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands, and Be-eshterah with its pasture lands; two cities."
Joshua,21,28,"From the tribe of Issachar, they gave Kishion with its pasture lands, Daberath with its pasture lands"
Joshua,21,29,"Jarmuth with its pasture lands, En-gannim with its pasture lands; four cities."
Joshua,21,30,"From the tribe of Asher, they gave Mishal with its pasture lands, Abdon with its pasture lands"
Joshua,21,31,Helkath with its pasture lands and Rehob with its pasture lands; four cities.
Joshua,21,32,"From the tribe of Naphtali, they gave Kedesh in Galilee, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands and Hammoth-dor with its pasture lands and Kartan with its pasture lands; three cities."
Joshua,21,33,All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their pasture lands.
Joshua,21,34,"Now to the families of the sons of Merari, the rest of the Levites, they gave from the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its pasture lands and Kartah with its pasture lands."
Joshua,21,35,"Dimnah with its pasture lands, Nahalal with its pasture lands; four cities."
Joshua,21,36,"From the tribe of Reuben, they gave Bezer with its pasture lands and Jahaz with its pasture lands"
Joshua,21,37,Kedemoth with its pasture lands and Mephaath with its pasture lands; four cities.
Joshua,21,38,"From the tribe of Gad, they gave Ramoth in Gilead, the city of refuge for the manslayer, with its pasture lands and Mahanaim with its pasture lands"
Joshua,21,39,"Heshbon with its pasture lands, Jazer with its pasture lands; four cities in all."
Joshua,21,40,"All these were the cities of the sons of Merari according to their families, the rest of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities."
Joshua,21,41,All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the sons of Israel were forty-eight cities with their pasture lands.
Joshua,21,42,These cities each had its surrounding pasture lands; thus it was with all these cities.
Joshua,21,43,"So Yahweh gave Israel all the land which He had sworn to give to their fathers, and they possessed it and lived in it."
Joshua,21,44,"And Yahweh gave them rest on every side, according to all that He had sworn to their fathers, and no one of all their enemies stood before them; Yahweh gave all their enemies into their hand."
Joshua,21,45,Not one promise of the good promises which Yahweh had promised to the house of Israel failed; all came to pass.
Joshua,22,1,Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh
Joshua,22,2,"and said to them, “You have kept all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you and have listened to my voice in all that I commanded you."
Joshua,22,3,"You have not forsaken your brothers these many days to this day, but have kept the responsibility of the commandment of Yahweh your God."
Joshua,22,4,"And now Yahweh your God has given rest to your brothers, as He spoke to them; so now turn and go to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan."
Joshua,22,5,"Only keep yourselves very carefully to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, to love Yahweh your God and walk in all His ways and keep His commandments and cling to Him and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.”"
Joshua,22,6,"Then Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents."
Joshua,22,7,"Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua gave a possession among their brothers westward beyond the Jordan. So when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them"
Joshua,22,8,"and spoke to them, saying, “Return to your tents with great riches and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, iron, and with very many clothes; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.”"
Joshua,22,9,"Then the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home and departed from the sons of Israel at Shiloh which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession which they had possessed, according to the command of Yahweh by the hand of Moses."
Joshua,22,10,"And they came to the region of the Jordan which is in the land of Canaan, and the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan, a large altar in appearance."
Joshua,22,11,"And the sons of Israel heard it said, “Behold, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar at the entrance of the land of Canaan, in the region of the Jordan, on the side belonging to the sons of Israel.”"
Joshua,22,12,"Then the sons of Israel heard of it, and the whole congregation of the sons of Israel assembled themselves at Shiloh to go up against them in war."
Joshua,22,13,"Then the sons of Israel sent to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest"
Joshua,22,14,"and with him ten leaders, one leader for each father’s household from each of the tribes of Israel; and each one of them was the head of his father’s household among the thousands of Israel."
Joshua,22,15,"So they came to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them saying"
Joshua,22,16,"“Thus says the whole congregation of Yahweh, ‘What is this unfaithful act which you have committed against the God of Israel, turning away from following Yahweh this day, by building yourselves an altar, to rebel against Yahweh this day?"
Joshua,22,17,"Is the iniquity of Peor too small a thing for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although there was a plague on the congregation of Yahweh?"
Joshua,22,18,"Yet you are turning away this day from following Yahweh. Now it will be that, if you rebel against Yahweh today, He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel tomorrow."
Joshua,22,19,"If, however, the land of your possession is unclean, then cross into the land of the possession of Yahweh, where the tabernacle of Yahweh dwells, and take possession among us. But do not rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us by building an altar for yourselves, besides the altar of Yahweh our God."
Joshua,22,20,"Did not Achan the son of Zerah act unfaithfully in the things devoted to destruction, and indignation fall on all the congregation of Israel? But he was not the only man to breathe his last in his iniquity.’ ”"
Joshua,22,21,Then the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel.
Joshua,22,22,"“The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, the Mighty One, God, Yahweh! He knows, and may Israel itself know. If it was in rebellion or if in an unfaithful act against Yahweh, do not save us this day!"
Joshua,22,23,"If we have built for ourselves an altar to turn away from following Yahweh, or if to perform a burnt offering or grain offering on it, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings on it, may Yahweh Himself require it."
Joshua,22,24,"But truly we have done this out of concern, for a reason, saying, ‘In time to come your sons may say to our sons, “What have you to do with Yahweh, the God of Israel?"
Joshua,22,25,"And Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you, you sons of Reuben and sons of Gad; you have no portion in Yahweh.” So your sons may make our sons stop fearing Yahweh.’"
Joshua,22,26,"“Therefore we said, ‘Let us build an altar, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice"
Joshua,22,27,"rather it shall be a witness between us and you and between our generations after us, that we are to perform the service of Yahweh before Him with our burnt offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings, so that your sons will not say to our sons in time to come, “You have no portion in Yahweh.” ’"
Joshua,22,28,"Therefore we said, ‘It will also be that if they say this to us or to our generations in time to come, then we shall say, “See the copy of the altar of Yahweh which our fathers made, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice; rather it is a witness between us and you.” ’"
Joshua,22,29,"Far be it from us to rebel against Yahweh and turn away from following Yahweh this day, by building an altar for burnt offering, for grain offering or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Yahweh our God which is before His tabernacle.”"
Joshua,22,30,"So Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spoke. And it was good in their sight."
Joshua,22,31,"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Manasseh, “Today we know that Yahweh is in our midst because you have not committed this unfaithful act against Yahweh; so then you have delivered the sons of Israel from the hand of Yahweh.”"
Joshua,22,32,"Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the leaders returned from the sons of Reuben and from the sons of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and brought back word to them."
Joshua,22,33,"And the word was good in the sight of the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel blessed God; and they did not speak of going up against them in war to destroy the land in which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad were living."
Joshua,22,34,"And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar Witness; “For,” they said, “it is a witness between us that Yahweh is God.”"
Joshua,23,1,"Now it happened after many days, after Yahweh had given rest to Israel from all their enemies on every side, and Joshua was old, advanced in years"
Joshua,23,2,"that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and their heads and their judges and their officers, and said to them, “I am old, advanced in years."
Joshua,23,3,"And you have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all these nations because of you, for Yahweh your God is He who has been fighting for you."
Joshua,23,4,"See, I have allotted to you these nations which remain as an inheritance for your tribes, with all the nations which I have cut off, from the Jordan even to the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun."
Joshua,23,5,"And Yahweh your God, He will thrust them out from before you and dispossess them before you; and you will possess their land, just as Yahweh your God promised you."
Joshua,23,6,"Be very strong, then, to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, so that you may not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left"
Joshua,23,7,"so that you will not go along with these nations, these which remain among you, and you will not mention the name of their gods, and you will not make anyone swear by them, and you will not serve them, and you will not bow down to them."
Joshua,23,8,"But you are to cling to Yahweh your God, as you have done to this day."
Joshua,23,9,"For Yahweh has dispossessed great and mighty nations from before you; and as for you, no man has stood before you to this day."
Joshua,23,10,"One of your men will pursue one thousand, for Yahweh your God is He who fights for you, just as He promised you."
Joshua,23,11,So keep your souls very carefully to love Yahweh your God.
Joshua,23,12,"For if you ever turn back and cling to the rest of these nations, these which remain among you, and intermarry with them, so that you go along with them and they with you"
Joshua,23,13,"know with certainty that Yahweh your God will not continue to dispossess these nations from before you; but they will be a snare and a trap to you and a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good land which Yahweh your God has given you."
Joshua,23,14,"“Now behold, today I am going the way of all the earth, and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one word of all the good words which Yahweh your God spoke concerning you has failed; all have come to pass for you; not one word of them has failed."
Joshua,23,15,"And it will be that just as all the good words which Yahweh your God spoke to you have come upon you, so Yahweh will bring upon you all the calamitous words, until He has destroyed you from off this good land which Yahweh your God has given you."
Joshua,23,16,"When you trespass against the covenant of Yahweh your God, which He commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then the anger of Yahweh will burn against you, and you will perish quickly from off the good land which He has given you.”"
Joshua,24,1,Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and called for the elders of Israel and for their heads and their judges and their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
Joshua,24,2,"And Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘From ancient times your fathers lived beyond the River, namely, Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, and they served other gods."
Joshua,24,3,Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan and multiplied his seed and gave him Isaac.
Joshua,24,4,"To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau, and to Esau I gave Mount Seir to possess it; but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt."
Joshua,24,5,"Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I smote Egypt by what I did in its midst; and afterward I brought you out."
Joshua,24,6,"And I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and Egypt pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea."
Joshua,24,7,Then they cried out to Yahweh; He put darkness between you and the Egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered them; and your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt. And you lived in the wilderness for many days.
Joshua,24,8,"Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan, and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you."
Joshua,24,9,"Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel, and he sent and summoned Balaam the son of Beor to curse you."
Joshua,24,10,"But I was not willing to listen to Balaam. So he blessed you repeatedly, and I delivered you from his hand."
Joshua,24,11,"And you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho; and the citizens of Jericho fought against you, and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Girgashite, the Hivite and the Jebusite. Thus I gave them into your hand."
Joshua,24,12,"Then I sent the hornet before you, and it drove out the two kings of the Amorites from before you, but not by your sword or your bow."
Joshua,24,13,"And I gave you a land on which you had not labored and cities which you had not built, and you have lived in them; you are eating of vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.’"
Joshua,24,14,"“So now, fear Yahweh and serve Him in integrity and truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve Yahweh."
Joshua,24,15,"If it is evil in your sight to serve Yahweh, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve: whether the gods which your fathers served which were beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my house, we will serve Yahweh.”"
Joshua,24,16,"And the people answered and said, “Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh to serve other gods"
Joshua,24,17,"for Yahweh our God is He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery, and who did these great signs in our sight and kept us through all the way in which we went and among all the peoples through whose midst we passed."
Joshua,24,18,"And Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land. We also will serve Yahweh, for He is our God.”"
Joshua,24,19,"Then Joshua said to the people, “You will not be able to serve Yahweh, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your transgression or your sins."
Joshua,24,20,"If you forsake Yahweh and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do you harm and consume you after He has done good to you.”"
Joshua,24,21,"And the people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve Yahweh.”"
Joshua,24,22,"And Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen for yourselves Yahweh, to serve Him.” And they said, “We are witnesses.”"
Joshua,24,23,"“So now, put away the foreign gods which are in your midst, and incline your hearts to Yahweh, the God of Israel.”"
Joshua,24,24,"And the people said to Joshua, “We will serve Yahweh our God, and we will listen to His voice.”"
Joshua,24,25,So Joshua cut a covenant with the people that day and made for them a statute and a judgment in Shechem.
Joshua,24,26,And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh.
Joshua,24,27,"And Joshua said to all the people, “Behold, this stone shall be for a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of Yahweh which He spoke to us; thus it shall be for a witness against you, lest you deny your God.”"
Joshua,24,28,"Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to his inheritance."
Joshua,24,29,"Now it happened that after these things, Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being 110 years old."
Joshua,24,30,"And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of Mount Gaash."
Joshua,24,31,"And Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who survived Joshua, who knew all the work of Yahweh which He had done for Israel."
Joshua,24,32,"Now they buried the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought up from Egypt, at Shechem, in the portion of the field which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred qesitah; and they became the inheritance of Joseph’s sons."
Joshua,24,33,"And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him at Gibeah of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill country of Ephraim."
