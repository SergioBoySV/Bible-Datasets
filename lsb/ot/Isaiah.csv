Isaiah,1,1,"The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem, which he beheld in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah."
Isaiah,1,2,"Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth;
For Yahweh speaks,
“Sons I have reared and raised up,
But they have transgressed against Me."
Isaiah,1,3,"“An ox knows its owner,
And a donkey its master’s manger,
But Israel does not know;
My people do not perceive.”"
Isaiah,1,4,"¶Alas, sinful nation,
People heavy with iniquity,
Seed of evildoers,
Sons who act corruptly!
They have forsaken Yahweh;
They have spurned the Holy One of Israel;
They have become estranged from Him."
Isaiah,1,5,"¶Where will you be stricken again,
As you continue in your rebellion?
The whole head is sick,
And the whole heart is faint."
Isaiah,1,6,"From the sole of the foot even to the head
There is nothing sound in it,
Only bruises, wounds, and raw wounds,
Not pressed out, not bandaged,
Not softened with oil."
Isaiah,1,7,"¶Your land is desolate;
Your cities are burned with fire;
Your fields—strangers are devouring them in your presence;
It is desolate, as overthrown by strangers."
Isaiah,1,8,"The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard,
Like a watchman’s hut in a cucumber field, like a besieged city."
Isaiah,1,9,"Unless Yahweh of hosts
Had left us a few survivors,
We would be like Sodom,
We would be like Gomorrah."
Isaiah,1,10,"¶Hear the word of Yahweh,
You rulers of Sodom;
Give ear to the law of our God,
You people of Gomorrah."
Isaiah,1,11,"“What are your multiplied sacrifices to Me?”
Says Yahweh.
“I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams
And the fat of fed cattle;
And in the blood of bulls, lambs, or goats I take no pleasure."
Isaiah,1,12,"“When you come to appear before Me,
Who requires of you this trampling of My courts?"
Isaiah,1,13,"“Bring your worthless offerings no longer,
Incense is an abomination to Me.
New moon and sabbath, the calling of convocation—
I cannot endure wickedness and the solemn assembly."
Isaiah,1,14,"“My soul hates your new moon festivals and your appointed times,
They have become a burden to Me;
I am weary of bearing them."
Isaiah,1,15,"“So when you spread out your hands in prayer,
I will hide My eyes from you;
Indeed, even though you multiply prayers,
I will not listen.
Your hands are full of blood."
Isaiah,1,16,"¶“Wash yourselves, purify yourselves;
Remove the evil of your deeds from before My eyes.
Cease to do evil"
Isaiah,1,17,"Learn to do good;
Seek justice,
Reprove the ruthless,
Execute justice for the orphan,
Plead for the widow."
Isaiah,1,18,"¶“Come now, and let us reason together,”
Says Yahweh,
“Though your sins are as scarlet,
They will be as white as snow;
Though they are red like crimson,
They will be like wool."
Isaiah,1,19,"“If you are willing and obey,
You will eat the best of the land"
Isaiah,1,20,"But if you refuse and rebel,
You will be eaten by the sword.”
For the mouth of Yahweh has spoken."
Isaiah,1,21,"¶How the faithful city has become a harlot,
She who was full of justice!
Righteousness once lodged in her,
But now murderers."
Isaiah,1,22,"Your silver has become dross,
Your drink diluted with water."
Isaiah,1,23,"Your rulers are rebels
And companions of thieves;
Everyone loves a bribe
And pursues rewards.
They do not execute justice for the orphan,
Nor does the widow’s plea come before them."
Isaiah,1,24,"¶Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of hosts,
The Mighty One of Israel, declares,
“Ah, I will be comforted concerning My adversaries,
And I will avenge Myself on My enemies."
Isaiah,1,25,"“I will also turn My hand against you,
And will smelt away your dross as with lye
And will remove all your alloy."
Isaiah,1,26,"“Then I will have your judges return as at the first,
And your counselors as at the beginning;
Afterwards you will be called the city of righteousness,
A faithful town.”"
Isaiah,1,27,"¶Zion will be redeemed with justice
And her repentant ones with righteousness."
Isaiah,1,28,"But transgressors and sinners will be broken together,
And those who forsake Yahweh will come to an end."
Isaiah,1,29,"For you will be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,
And you will be humiliated because of the gardens which you have chosen."
Isaiah,1,30,"For you will be like an oak whose leaf withers away
Or as a garden that has no water."
Isaiah,1,31,"And the strong man will become tinder,
His work also a spark.
Thus they shall both burn together,
And there will be none to quench them."
Isaiah,2,1,The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz beheld concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
Isaiah,2,2,"¶Now it will be that
In the last days
The mountain of the house of Yahweh
Will be established as the head of the mountains,
And will be lifted up above the hills;
And all the nations will stream to it."
Isaiah,2,3,"And many peoples will come and say,
“Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
To the house of the God of Jacob,
That He may instruct us from His ways
And that we may walk in His paths.”
For from Zion the law will go forth
And the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem."
Isaiah,2,4,"And He will judge between the nations,
And will render decisions for many peoples;
And they will hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.
Nation will not lift up sword against nation,
And never again will they learn war."
Isaiah,2,5,"¶Come, house of Jacob, and let us walk in the light of Yahweh."
Isaiah,2,6,"For You have abandoned Your people, the house of Jacob,
Because they are filled with influences from the east,
And they are soothsayers like the Philistines,
And they strike bargains with the children of foreigners."
Isaiah,2,7,"Their land has also been filled with silver and gold,
And there is no end to their treasures;
Their land has also been filled with horses,
And there is no end to their chariots."
Isaiah,2,8,"Their land has also been filled with idols;
They worship the work of their hands,
That which their fingers have made."
Isaiah,2,9,"So the common man has been bowed down,
And the man of importance has been made low,
But do not forgive them."
Isaiah,2,10,"Enter the rock and hide in the dust
From the dread of Yahweh and from the splendor of His majesty."
Isaiah,2,11,"The lofty look of man will be made low,
And the men made high will be bowed down,
And Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day."
Isaiah,2,12,"¶For Yahweh of hosts will have a day of reckoning
Against everyone who is proud and high
And against everyone who is lifted up,
That he may be made low."
Isaiah,2,13,"And it will be against all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up,
Against all the oaks of Bashan"
Isaiah,2,14,"Against all the high mountains,
Against all the hills that are lifted up"
Isaiah,2,15,"Against every lofty tower,
Against every fortified wall"
Isaiah,2,16,"Against all the ships of Tarshish
And against all the desirable craft."
Isaiah,2,17,"The loftiness of man will be bowed down,
And the men who are high will be made low;
And Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day"
Isaiah,2,18,But the idols will completely vanish.
Isaiah,2,19,"Men will go into caves of the rocks
And into holes of the ground
Before the dread of Yahweh
And the splendor of His majesty,
When He arises to make the earth tremble."
Isaiah,2,20,"In that day men will cast away to the moles and the bats
Their idols of silver and their idols of gold,
Which they made for themselves to worship"
Isaiah,2,21,"In order to go into the caverns of the rocks and the clefts of the cliffs
Before the dread of Yahweh and the splendor of His majesty,
When He arises to make the earth tremble."
Isaiah,2,22,"Stop regarding man, whose breath of life is in his nostrils;
For why should he be esteemed?"
Isaiah,3,1,"For behold, the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, is going to remove from Jerusalem and Judah
Both supply and support, the whole supply of bread
And the whole supply of water"
Isaiah,3,2,"The mighty man and the man of war,
The judge and the prophet,
The diviner and the elder"
Isaiah,3,3,"The commander of fifty and the highly respected man,
The counselor and the wise craftsman,
And the experienced enchanter."
Isaiah,3,4,"And I will make young men their princes,
And capricious children will rule over them"
Isaiah,3,5,"And the people will be oppressed,
Each one by another, and each one by his neighbor;
The youth will overwhelm the elder
And the dishonorable against the honorable."
Isaiah,3,6,"When a man grasps his brother in his father’s house, saying,
“You have a cloak, you shall be our ruler,
And these ruins will be under your hand,”"
Isaiah,3,7,"He will protest on that day, saying,
“I will not be your healer,
For in my house there is neither bread nor cloak;
You should not appoint me ruler of the people.”"
Isaiah,3,8,"For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen,
Because their tongue and their deeds are against Yahweh,
To rebel against His glorious presence."
Isaiah,3,9,"The expression of their faces answers against them,
And they declare their sin like Sodom;
They do not even conceal it.
Woe to their soul!
For they have dealt out evil on themselves."
Isaiah,3,10,"Say to the righteous that it will go well with them,
For they will eat the fruit of their deeds."
Isaiah,3,11,"Woe to the wicked! It will go badly with him,
For what he has dealt out will be done to him."
Isaiah,3,12,"O My people! Their taskmasters are infants,
And women rule over them.
O My people! Those who guide you lead you astray
And swallow up the way of your paths."
Isaiah,3,13,"¶Yahweh takes His stand to contend,
And stands to judge the peoples."
Isaiah,3,14,"Yahweh enters into judgment with the elders of His people and His princes,
“It is you who have consumed the vineyard;
The plunder robbed of the afflicted is in your houses."
Isaiah,3,15,"“What do you mean by crushing My people
And grinding the face of the afflicted?”
Declares Lord Yahweh of hosts."
Isaiah,3,16,"Moreover, Yahweh said, “Because the daughters of Zion are haughty
And walk with outstretched necks and seductive eyes,
And go along with mincing steps
And tinkle the bangles on their feet"
Isaiah,3,17,"Therefore the Lord will smite the skull of the daughters of Zion with scabs,
And Yahweh will make their foreheads bare.”"
Isaiah,3,18,"In that day the Lord will remove the beauty of their anklets, headbands, crescent ornaments"
Isaiah,3,19,"dangling earrings, bracelets, veils"
Isaiah,3,20,"headdresses, ankle chains, sashes, perfume boxes, enchanted charms"
Isaiah,3,21,"finger rings, nose rings"
Isaiah,3,22,"festal robes, outer tunics, cloaks, money purses"
Isaiah,3,23,"hand mirrors, undergarments, turbans, and shawls."
Isaiah,3,24,"Now it will be that instead of sweet perfume there will be the smell of rot;
Instead of a belt, a rope;
Instead of well-set hair, a plucked-out scalp;
Instead of fine clothes, a donning of sackcloth;
And branding instead of beauty."
Isaiah,3,25,"Your men will fall by the sword
And your mighty ones in battle."
Isaiah,3,26,"And her gates will lament and mourn,
And deserted she will sit on the ground."

Isaiah,4,2,"In that day the Branch of Yahweh will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth will be the pride and the honor of those of Israel who escape."
Isaiah,4,3,It will be that he who remains in Zion and is left in Jerusalem will be called holy—everyone who is written down for life in Jerusalem.
Isaiah,4,4,"When the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and rinsed away the bloodshed of Jerusalem from her midst, by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning"
Isaiah,4,5,"then Yahweh will create over the whole area of Mount Zion and over her convocation a cloud by day, even smoke, and the brightness of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory will be a canopy."
Isaiah,4,6,"And there will be a booth to give shade from the heat by day, and refuge and a hiding place from the storm and the rain."
Isaiah,5,1,"Let me sing now for my well-beloved
A song of my beloved concerning His vineyard.
My well-beloved had a vineyard on a fertile hill."
Isaiah,5,2,"He dug it all around, removed its stones,
And planted it with the choicest vine.
And He built a tower in the middle of it
And also hewed out a wine vat in it;
Then He hoped for it to produce good grapes,
But it produced only worthless ones."
Isaiah,5,3,"¶“So now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,
Please judge between Me and My vineyard."
Isaiah,5,4,"“What more was there to do for My vineyard that I have not done in it?
Why, when I hoped for it to produce good grapes did it produce worthless ones?"
Isaiah,5,5,"“So now let Me tell you what I am going to do to My vineyard:
I will remove its hedge, and it will be consumed;
I will break down its wall, and it will become trampled ground."
Isaiah,5,6,"“I will lay it waste;
It will not be pruned or hoed,
But briars and thorns will come up.
I will also command the clouds to rain no rain on it.”"
Isaiah,5,7,"¶For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel
And the men of Judah His delightful plant.
Thus He hoped for justice, but behold, bloodshed;
For righteousness, but behold, a cry of distress."
Isaiah,5,8,"¶Woe to those who add house to house and join field to field,
Until there is no more room,
So that you have to live alone in the midst of the land!"
Isaiah,5,9,"In my ears Yahweh of hosts has sworn, “Surely, many houses shall become desolate,
Even great and good ones, without inhabitants."
Isaiah,5,10,"“For ten acres of vineyard will yield only one bath of wine,
And a homer of seed will yield but an ephah of grain.”"
Isaiah,5,11,"¶Woe to those who rise early in the morning that they may pursue strong drink,
Who stay up late in the evening that wine may inflame them!"
Isaiah,5,12,"And their banquets are accompanied by lyre and harp, by tambourine and flute, and by wine;
But they do not look upon the deeds of Yahweh,
Nor do they see the work of His hands."
Isaiah,5,13,"¶Therefore My people go into exile for their lack of knowledge;
And their honorable men are famished,
And their multitude is parched with thirst."
Isaiah,5,14,"Therefore Sheol has enlarged its throat and opened its mouth without limit;
And Jerusalem’s majesty, her multitude, her rumbling, and the exultant within her, descend into it."
Isaiah,5,15,"So the common man will be bowed down and the man of importance will be made low,
The eyes of the lofty also will be made low."
Isaiah,5,16,"But Yahweh of hosts will be lofty in judgment,
And the holy God will show Himself holy in righteousness."
Isaiah,5,17,"Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture,
And sojourners will eat in the waste places of the wealthy."
Isaiah,5,18,"¶Woe to those who drag iniquity with the cords of worthlessness,
And sin as if with cart ropes"
Isaiah,5,19,"Who say, “Let Him hurry, let Him hasten His work, that we may see it;
And let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near
And come to pass, that we may know it!”"
Isaiah,5,20,"¶Woe to those who call evil good and good evil,
Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness,
Who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!"
Isaiah,5,21,"Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes
And understanding in their own sight!"
Isaiah,5,22,"Woe to those who are mighty men in drinking wine
And valiant men in mixing strong drink"
Isaiah,5,23,"Who declare the wicked righteous for a bribe,
And remove the righteous standing of the ones who are righteous!"
Isaiah,5,24,"¶Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes stubble
And dry grass collapses into the flame,
So their root will become like rot and their blossom blow away as dust;
For they have rejected the law of Yahweh of hosts
And the word of the Holy One of Israel they have spurned."
Isaiah,5,25,"On this account, the anger of Yahweh has burned against His people,
And He has stretched out His hand against them and struck them down.
And the mountains trembled, and their corpses lay like refuse in the middle of the streets.
For all this His anger is not turned back,
But His hand is still stretched out."
Isaiah,5,26,"¶He will also lift up a standard to the distant nations,
And will whistle for it from the ends of the earth;
And behold, it will come with speed swiftly."
Isaiah,5,27,"No one in it is weary or stumbles,
None slumbers or sleeps;
Nor is the belt at its waist undone,
Nor its sandal strap broken."
Isaiah,5,28,"Its arrows are sharp and all its bows are bent;
The hoofs of its horses seem like flint and its chariot wheels like a whirlwind."
Isaiah,5,29,"Its roaring is like a lioness, and it roars like young lions;
It growls and seizes the prey
And carries it off with no one to deliver it."
Isaiah,5,30,"And it will growl over it in that day like the roaring of the sea.
If one looks to the land, behold, there is darkness and distress;
Even the light is darkened by its clouds."
Isaiah,6,1,"In the year of King Uzziah’s death I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, with the train of His robe filling the temple."
Isaiah,6,2,"Seraphim stood above Him, each having six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew."
Isaiah,6,3,"And one called out to another and said,
“Holy, Holy, Holy, is Yahweh of hosts;
The whole earth is full of His glory.”"
Isaiah,6,4,"And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called out, while the house of God was filling with smoke."
Isaiah,6,5,"Then I said,
“Woe is me, for I am ruined!
For I am a man of unclean lips,
And I live among a people of unclean lips;
For my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of hosts.”"
Isaiah,6,6,"Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal in his hand, which he had taken from the altar with tongs."
Isaiah,6,7,"And he touched my mouth with it and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is atoned for.”"
Isaiah,6,8,"Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?” Then I said, “Here am I. Send me!”"
Isaiah,6,9,"He said, “Go, and tell this people:
‘Keep on hearing, but do not understand;
Keep on seeing, but do not know.’"
Isaiah,6,10,"“Render the hearts of this people insensitive,
Their ears dull,
And their eyes dim,
Lest they see with their eyes,
And hear with their ears,
And understand with their hearts,
And return and be healed.”"
Isaiah,6,11,"Then I said, “Lord, how long?” And He said,
“Until cities are devastated and without inhabitant,
Houses are without people,
And the land is devastated to desolation"
Isaiah,6,12,"And Yahweh has removed men far away,
And the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land."
Isaiah,6,13,"“Yet there will be a tenth portion in it,
And it will again be subject to burning,
Like a terebinth or like an oak
Whose stump remains when it is felled.
The holy seed is its stump.”"
Isaiah,7,1,"Now it happened in the days of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but could not conquer it."
Isaiah,7,2,"When it was told to the house of David, saying, “The Arameans have camped in Ephraim,” his heart and the hearts of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind."
Isaiah,7,3,"Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shear-jashub, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, to the highway of the fuller’s field"
Isaiah,7,4,"and say to him, ‘Take care and stay quiet, have no fear and do not be fainthearted because of these two stubs of smoldering firebrands, on account of the burning anger of Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah."
Isaiah,7,5,"Because Aram, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has counseled evil against you, saying"
Isaiah,7,6,"“Let us go up against Judah and terrorize it, and make for ourselves a breach in its walls and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,”"
Isaiah,7,7,"thus says Lord Yahweh: “It shall not stand, nor shall it happen."
Isaiah,7,8,"For the head of Aram is Damascus and the head of Damascus is Rezin (now within another sixty-five years Ephraim will be shattered, so that it is no longer a people)"
Isaiah,7,9,"and the head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you do not establish your faith in Yahweh, you surely shall not be established.” ’ ”"
Isaiah,7,10,"Then Yahweh spoke again to Ahaz, saying"
Isaiah,7,11,“Ask a sign for yourself from Yahweh your God; make it deep as Sheol or high as heaven.”
Isaiah,7,12,"But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not test Yahweh!”"
Isaiah,7,13,"Then he said, “Listen now, O house of David! Is it too slight a thing for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God as well?"
Isaiah,7,14,"Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name Immanuel."
Isaiah,7,15,He will eat curds and honey in order that He will know to refuse evil and choose good.
Isaiah,7,16,"For before the boy will know to refuse evil and choose good, the land whose two kings you dread will be forsaken."
Isaiah,7,17,"Yahweh will bring on you, on your people, and on your father’s house days which have never come since the day that Ephraim separated from Judah—the king of Assyria!”"
Isaiah,7,18,"And it will be in that day, that Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is in the remotest part of the rivers of Egypt and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria."
Isaiah,7,19,"And they will all come and rest upon the steep ravines, on the crevices of the cliffs, on all the thorn bushes, and on all the watering places."
Isaiah,7,20,"In that day, the Lord will shave with a razor—one hired from regions beyond the River (that is, the king of Assyria)—the head and the hair of the legs; and it will also remove the beard."
Isaiah,7,21,"And it will be in that day, that a man may keep alive a heifer and a pair of sheep"
Isaiah,7,22,"and because of the abundance of the milk produced, he will eat curds, for everyone that is left within the land will eat curds and honey."
Isaiah,7,23,"And it will be in that day, that every place where there used to be one thousand vines, valued at one thousand shekels of silver, will become briars and thorns."
Isaiah,7,24,People will come there with bows and arrows because all the land will be briars and thorns.
Isaiah,7,25,"As for all the hills which used to be cultivated with the hoe, you will not go there for fear of briars and thorns; but they will become a place for pasturing oxen and for sheep to trample."
Isaiah,8,1,"Then Yahweh said to me, “Take for yourself a large tablet and write on it in ordinary letters: Concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz."
Isaiah,8,2,"And I will take to Myself faithful witnesses for testimony, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.”"
Isaiah,8,3,"Then I drew near to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then Yahweh said to me, “Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz"
Isaiah,8,4,"for before the boy knows how to cry out ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria.”"
Isaiah,8,5,"Again Yahweh spoke to me further, saying"
Isaiah,8,6,"“Inasmuch as these people have rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah
And rejoice in Rezin and the son of Remaliah"
Isaiah,8,7,"Now therefore, behold, the Lord is about to bring on them the mighty and abundant waters of the River—
The king of Assyria and all his glory;
And it will rise up over all its channels and go over all its banks."
Isaiah,8,8,"“Then it will sweep on into Judah; it will overflow and pass through;
It will reach even to the neck;
And the spread of its wings will fill the breadth of Your land, O Immanuel."
Isaiah,8,9,"¶“Be broken, O peoples, and be shattered;
And give ear, all remote places of the earth.
Gird yourselves, yet be shattered;
Gird yourselves, yet be shattered."
Isaiah,8,10,"“Devise counsel, but it will be thwarted;
Speak a word, but it will not stand,
For God is with us.”"
Isaiah,8,11,"For thus Yahweh spoke to me with a strong hand and disciplined me not to walk in the way of this people, saying"
Isaiah,8,12,"“You are not to say, ‘It is a conspiracy!’
In regard to all that this people call a conspiracy;
And you are not to fear what they fear, and you shall not tremble."
Isaiah,8,13,"“It is Yahweh of hosts whom you should regard as holy.
And He shall be your fear,
And He shall be your cause of trembling."
Isaiah,8,14,"“Then He shall become a sanctuary;
But to both the houses of Israel, a stone to strike and a rock to stumble over,
And a snare and a trap for the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
Isaiah,8,15,"“And many will stumble over them;
Then they will fall and be broken;
They will even be snared and caught.”"
Isaiah,8,16,"Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples."
Isaiah,8,17,And I will wait for Yahweh who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob; and I will hope for Him.
Isaiah,8,18,"Behold, I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and wonders in Israel from Yahweh of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion."
Isaiah,8,19,"Now when they say to you, “Inquire of the mediums and the spiritists who whisper and mutter,” should not a people inquire of their God? Should they inquire of the dead on behalf of the living?"
Isaiah,8,20,"To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn."
Isaiah,8,21,"And they will pass through the land hard-pressed and hungry, and it will be that when they are hungry, they will be angry and curse their king and their God as they face upward."
Isaiah,8,22,"Then they will look to the earth, and behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and they will be banished into thick darkness."
Isaiah,9,1,"But there will be no more gloom for her who was in anguish; in earlier times He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali with contempt, but later on He shall make it glorious, by the way of the sea, on the other side of Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles."
Isaiah,9,2,"The people who walk in darkness
Will see a great light;
Those who live in the land of the shadow of death,
The light will shine on them."
Isaiah,9,3,"You shall multiply the nation,
You shall make great their gladness;
They will be glad in Your presence
As with the gladness of harvest,
As men rejoice when they divide the spoil."
Isaiah,9,4,"For You shall shatter the yoke of their burden and the staff on their shoulders,
The rod of their taskmaster, as at the battle of Midian."
Isaiah,9,5,"For every boot of the booted warrior in the rumbling of battle,
And cloak rolled in blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire."
Isaiah,9,6,"For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us;
And the government will rest on His shoulders;
And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
Eternal Father, Prince of Peace."
Isaiah,9,7,"There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace,
On the throne of David and over his kingdom,
To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness
From then on and forevermore.
The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will accomplish this."
Isaiah,9,8,"¶The Lord sends a message against Jacob,
And it falls on Israel."
Isaiah,9,9,"And all the people know it,
That is, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria,
Saying in lofty pride and in arrogance of heart"
Isaiah,9,10,"“The bricks have fallen down,
But we will rebuild with cut stones;
The sycamores have been cut in pieces,
But we will replace them with cedars.”"
Isaiah,9,11,"Therefore Yahweh exalts against them adversaries from Rezin
And incites their enemies"
Isaiah,9,12,"The Arameans on the east and the Philistines on the west;
And they devour Israel with gaping jaws.
In spite of all this, His anger does not turn back,
And His hand is still stretched out."
Isaiah,9,13,"¶Yet the people do not turn back to Him who struck them,
Nor do they seek Yahweh of hosts."
Isaiah,9,14,"So Yahweh cuts off head and tail from Israel,
Both palm branch and bulrush in a single day."
Isaiah,9,15,"The head is the elder and the highly respected man,
And the prophet who teaches falsehood is the tail."
Isaiah,9,16,"For those who guide this people are leading them astray;
And those who are guided by them are brought to confusion."
Isaiah,9,17,"Therefore the Lord is not glad in their choice men,
Nor does He have compassion on their orphans or their widows;
For every one of them is godless and an evildoer,
And every mouth is speaking wicked foolishness.
In spite of all this, His anger does not turn back,
And His hand is still stretched out."

It consumes briars and thorns;
It even sets the thickets of the forest aflame,
And they roll upward in a column of smoke."

And in the devastation which will come from afar?

And the staff in whose hands is My indignation"

And command it against the people of My fury
To capture spoil and to seize plunder,
And to trample them down like mud in the streets."
Isaiah,10,7,"But it does not intend to act in this way,
And it does not think in its heart in this way,
Rather, what is in its heart is to destroy
And to cut off many nations."
Isaiah,10,8,"For it says, “Are not my princes all kings?"
Isaiah,10,9,"“Is not Calno like Carchemish,
Or Hamath like Arpad,
Or Samaria like Damascus?"

Whose graven images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria"
Isaiah,10,11,"Shall I not do to Jerusalem and her images
Just as I have done to Samaria and her idols?”"

And as one gathers abandoned eggs, I gathered all the earth;
And there was not one that flapped its wing or opened its beak or chirped.”"
Isaiah,10,15,"¶Is the axe to boast itself over the one who chops with it?
Is the saw to magnify itself over the one who wields it?

Only a remnant within them will return;
A destructive end is decreed, overflowing with righteousness."
Isaiah,10,23,"For a complete destruction, one that is decreed, Lord Yahweh of hosts will do in the midst of the whole land."

And He will not judge by what His eyes see,
Nor render a decision by what His ears hear"

Like dazzling heat in the sunshine,
Like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”"

From a people tall and smooth,
Even from a people feared far and wide,

And they will each fight against his brother and each against his neighbor,
City against city and kingdom against kingdom."

Isaiah,19,12,"Well then, where are your wise men?
Please let them tell you,
And let them understand what Yahweh of hosts
Has counseled against Egypt."

The princes of Memphis are deluded;
Those who are the cornerstone of her tribes
Have led Egypt astray."

They have led Egypt astray in all that it does,
As a drunken man strays into his vomit."

Which its head or tail, its palm branch or bulrush, may do."

Isaiah,19,19,"In that day there will be an altar to Yahweh in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Yahweh near its border."

Isaiah,20,1,"In the year that the commander came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him and he fought against Ashdod and captured it"
Isaiah,20,2,"at that time Yahweh spoke by the hand of Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, “Go and loosen the sackcloth from your hips and take your shoes off your feet.” And he did so, going naked and barefoot."
Isaiah,20,3,"And Yahweh said, “Even as My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot three years as a sign and wonder against Egypt and Ethiopia"
Isaiah,20,4,"so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt."
Isaiah,20,5,Then they will be dismayed and ashamed because of Ethiopia their hope and Egypt their boast.
Isaiah,20,6,"So the inhabitants of this coastland will say in that day, ‘Behold, such is our hope, where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria; and we, how shall we escape?’ ”"

As whirlwinds in the Negev sweep on,
It comes from the wilderness, from a fearsome land."

The treacherous one still deals treacherously, and the destroyer still destroys.

I have made an end of all the groaning she has caused."

Pains have seized me like the pains of a woman in labor.
I am so bewildered I cannot hear, so terrified I cannot see."
Isaiah,21,4,"My heart reels; horror terrorizes me;
The twilight I longed for has been turned for me into trembling."

“Go, station the lookout, let him declare what he sees."
Isaiah,21,7,"“Indeed, he shall see riders, horsemen in pairs,
Riders of donkeys, riders of camels,
So let him pay close attention, very close attention.”"
Isaiah,21,8,"Then the lookout called,
“O Lord, I stand continually by day on the watchtower,
And I am stationed every night at my guard post."

If you would inquire, inquire;
Come back again.”"

O inhabitants of the land of Tema,
Meet with bread the one who has fled."
Isaiah,21,15,"For they have fled from the swords,
From the drawn sword, and from the bent bow
And from the heaviness of battle."

Isaiah,22,1,"The oracle concerning the valley of vision.
What is the matter with you now, that you have all gone up to the housetops?"
Isaiah,22,2,"You who were full of noise,
You roaring city, you exultant town;
Your slain were not slain with the sword,
Nor did they die in battle."
Isaiah,22,3,"All your rulers have fled together,
And have been captured without the bow;
All of you who were found were captured together,
Though they had fled far away."
Isaiah,22,4,"Therefore I say, “Turn your gaze away from me,
Let me weep bitterly,
Do not insist on comforting me concerning the destruction of the daughter of my people.”"

In the valley of vision,
A breaking down of walls
And a crying to the mountain."

And tore down houses to fortify the wall."
Isaiah,22,11,"And you made a reservoir between the two walls
For the waters of the old pool.
But you did not look to Him who made it,
Nor did you see Him who formed it long ago."
Isaiah,22,12,"¶Therefore in that day Lord Yahweh of hosts called you to weeping, to wailing,
To shaving the head, and to wearing sackcloth."
Isaiah,22,13,"Instead, behold, there is joy and gladness,
Killing of cattle and slaughtering of sheep,
Eating of meat and drinking of wine:
“Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we may die.”"
Isaiah,22,14,"But Yahweh of hosts revealed Himself in my ears,
“Surely this iniquity shall not be atoned for you
Until you die,” says Lord Yahweh of hosts."

To Shebna, who is in charge of the royal household"
Isaiah,22,16,"‘What right do you have here,
And whom do you have here,
That you have hewn a tomb for yourself here,

You disgrace of your master’s house.’"

And I will pull you down from your station."

And he will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah."
Isaiah,22,22,"“Then I will set the key of the house of David on his shoulder,
When he opens no one will shut,
When he shuts no one will open."
Isaiah,22,23,"“I will drive him like a peg in a firm place,
And he will become a throne of glory to his father’s house."
Isaiah,22,24,"So they will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house, offspring and issue, all the least of vessels, from bowls to all the jars."
Isaiah,22,25,"In that day,” declares Yahweh of hosts, “the peg driven in a firm place will give way; it will even break off and fall, and the load hanging on it will be cut off, for Yahweh has spoken.”"

Wail, O ships of Tarshish,
For Tyre is destroyed, without house or harbor;
It is revealed to them from the land of Cyprus."
Isaiah,23,2,"Be silent, you inhabitants of the coastland,
You merchants of Sidon;
Your messengers crossed the sea"
Isaiah,23,3,"And were on many waters.
The grain of Shihor, the harvest of the Nile was her revenue;
And she was the nations’ gain."
Isaiah,23,4,"Be ashamed, O Sidon;
For the sea speaks, the strong defense of the sea, saying,
“I have neither travailed nor given birth;
I have neither brought up choice men nor reared virgins.”"
Isaiah,23,5,"When the report reaches Egypt,
They will be in travail at the report of Tyre."

Whose origin is from days of old,
Whose feet used to lead her to sojourn in distant places?"

To make contemptuous all the honored of the earth."
Isaiah,23,10,"Overflow your land like the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish;
There is no more restraint."
Isaiah,23,11,"He has stretched His hand out over the sea;
He has made the kingdoms tremble;
Yahweh has given a command concerning Canaan to demolish its strong defenses."

Arise, pass over to Cyprus; even there you will find no rest.”"
Isaiah,23,13,"Behold, the land of the Chaldeans—this is the people which was not; Assyria established it for desert creatures—they erected their siege towers, they stripped its palaces, they made it a ruin."
Isaiah,23,14,"Wail, O ships of Tarshish,
For your strong defense is destroyed."
Isaiah,23,15,"Now it will be in that day, that Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years like the days of one king. At the end of seventy years it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot"
Isaiah,23,16,"Take your harp, walk about the city,
O forgotten harlot;
Pluck the strings skillfully, sing many songs,
That you may be remembered."
Isaiah,23,17,And it will be at the end of seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre. Then she will go back to her harlot’s wages and will play the harlot with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.
Isaiah,23,18,"And her gain and her harlot’s wages will be set apart to Yahweh; it will not be treasured up or hoarded, but her gain will become sufficient food and choice attire for those who inhabit the presence of Yahweh."

Isaiah,24,5,"The earth is also polluted by its inhabitants, for they trespassed laws, violated statutes, broke the everlasting covenant."
Isaiah,24,6,"Therefore, a curse devours the earth, and those who inhabit it are held guilty. Therefore, the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men remain."

The vine languishes;
All the glad of heart sigh."

The joy of the earth is taken away into exile."
Isaiah,24,12,"Desolation remains in the city,
And the gate is struck down to ruins."
Isaiah,24,13,"For thus it will be in the midst of the earth among the peoples,
As the shaking of an olive tree,
As the gleanings when the grape harvest is over."
Isaiah,24,14,"They lift up their voices, they shout for joy;
They cry out from the west concerning the majesty of Yahweh."
Isaiah,24,15,"Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east,
The name of Yahweh, the God of Israel,
In the coastlands of the sea."
Isaiah,24,16,"From the ends of the earth we hear songs, “Glory to the Righteous One,”
But I say, “I waste away! I waste away! Woe is me!
The treacherous deal treacherously,
And the treacherous deal very treacherously.”"
Isaiah,24,17,"Panic and pit and pitfall
Are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth."

And it totters like a shack,

And it will fall, never to rise again."

That Yahweh will punish the host of heights on high,
And the kings of the earth on earth."

Like prisoners in the pit,
And will be confined in prison;
And after many days they will be punished."
Isaiah,24,23,"Then the moon will be humiliated and the sun ashamed,
For Yahweh of hosts will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,
And His glory will be before His elders."
Isaiah,25,1,"O Yahweh, You are my God;
I will exalt You, I will give thanks to Your name;
For You have worked wonders,
Counsels formed long ago, with perfect faithfulness."
Isaiah,25,2,"For You have made a city into a heap,
A fortified town into a ruin;
A palace of strangers is a city no more,
It will never be rebuilt."
Isaiah,25,3,"Therefore a strong people will glorify You;
Towns of ruthless nations will fear You."
Isaiah,25,4,"For You have been a strong defense for the poor,
A strong defense for the needy in his distress,
A refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat;
For the breath of the ruthless
Is like a rain storm against a wall."
Isaiah,25,5,"Like heat in a dry land, You subdue the rumbling of strangers;
Like heat by the shadow of a cloud, the song of the ruthless is silenced."
Isaiah,25,6,"¶And Yahweh of hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all peoples on this mountain;
A banquet of aged wine, choice pieces with marrow,
And refined, aged wine."

Even the veil which is stretched over all nations."

“Behold, this is our God in whom we have hoped that He would save us.
This is Yahweh in whom we have hoped;
Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation.”"
Isaiah,25,10,"For the hand of Yahweh will rest on this mountain,
And Moab will be trodden down in his place
As straw is trodden down in the water of a manure pile."
Isaiah,25,11,"And he will spread out his hands in the middle of it
As a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim,
But Yahweh will lay low his lofty pride together with the trickery of his hands."
Isaiah,25,12,"The unassailable fortifications of your walls He will bring down,

The one that keeps faithfulness."

The feet of the afflicted, the steps of the poor.”"
Isaiah,26,7,"¶The way of the righteous is upright;
O Upright One, make the path of the righteous level."

We have hoped for You eagerly;
Your name—the memory of You—is the desire of our souls."
Isaiah,26,9,"At night my soul longs for You,
Indeed, my spirit within me seeks You earnestly;
For when the earth experiences Your judgments,
The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness."

He does not learn righteousness;
He deals unjustly in the land of uprightness,
And does not perceive the majesty of Yahweh."

Since You have also performed for us all our works."
Isaiah,26,13,"O Yahweh our God, other masters besides You have ruled us;
But through You alone we bring Your name to remembrance."
Isaiah,26,14,"The dead will not live; the departed spirits will not rise;
Therefore You have visited and destroyed them,
And You have made all remembrance of them perish."
Isaiah,26,15,"You have increased the nation, O Yahweh;
You have increased the nation, You are glorified;
You have extended all the borders of the land."
Isaiah,26,16,"O Yahweh, they visited You in distress;
They could only whisper a prayer;
Your chastening was upon them."
Isaiah,26,17,"As the woman with child draws near to the time to give birth,
She writhes and cries out in her pangs of labor,
Thus were we before You, O Yahweh."
Isaiah,26,18,"We were with child, we writhed in labor;
We gave birth, as it seems, only to wind.
We could not accomplish salvation for the earth,
And the inhabitants of the world were not born."
Isaiah,26,19,"Your dead will live;
Their corpses will rise.
You who dwell in the dust, awake and shout for joy,
For your dew is as the dew of the dawn,
And the earth will give birth to the departed spirits."
Isaiah,26,20,"¶Come, my people, enter into your rooms
And close your doors behind you;
Hide for a little while
Until indignation passes by."
Isaiah,26,21,"For behold, Yahweh is about to come out from His place
To visit the iniquity of the inhabitants of the earth;
And the earth will reveal her bloodshed
And will no longer cover those of hers who were killed."
Isaiah,27,1,"In that day Yahweh will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent,
With His fierce and great and mighty sword,
Even Leviathan the twisted serpent;
And He will kill the dragon who lives in the sea."

I water it every moment.
Lest anyone damage it,
I keep it night and day."
Isaiah,27,4,"“I have no wrath.
Who would ever give Me briars and thorns in the battle?
I would step on them, I would burn them completely."

Let him make peace with Me,
Let him make peace with Me.”"
Isaiah,27,6,"In the days to come Jacob will take root,
Israel will blossom and bud,
And they will fill the whole world with produce."
Isaiah,27,7,"¶Like the striking of Him who has struck them, has He struck them?
Or like the slaughter of those of His who were killed, have they been killed?"
Isaiah,27,8,"You contended with them by driving them away, by making them forlorn.
With His fierce wind He has expelled them on the day of the east wind."
Isaiah,27,9,"Therefore through this, Jacob’s iniquity will be atoned for;
And this will be the whole fruit of the turning away of his sin:
When he makes all the altar stones like pulverized chalk stones,
When Asherim and incense altars will not stand."
Isaiah,27,10,"For the fortified city is isolated,
A haunt forlorn and forsaken like the desert;
There the calf will graze,
And there it will lie down and feed on its twigs."
Isaiah,27,11,"When its limbs are dry, they are broken off;
Women come and light a fire with them,
For they are not a people of discernment,
Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them.
And their Creator will not be gracious to them."
Isaiah,27,12,"And it will be in that day, that Yahweh will start His threshing from the flowing stream of the River to the brook of Egypt, and you will be gathered up one by one, O sons of Israel."
Isaiah,27,13,"And it will be in that day, that a great trumpet will be blown, and those who were perishing in the land of Assyria and who were banished in the land of Egypt will come and worship Yahweh in the holy mountain at Jerusalem."

And to the fading flower of its glorious beauty,
Which is at the head of the fertile valley
Of those who are overcome with wine!"
Isaiah,28,2,"Behold, the Lord has a strong and courageous agent;
As a storm of hail, a tempest of destruction,
Like a storm of mighty overflowing waters,
He has set it down to the earth with His hand."
Isaiah,28,3,The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim is trodden under foot.
Isaiah,28,4,"And the fading flower of its glorious beauty,
Which is at the head of the fertile valley,
Will be like the first-ripe fig prior to summer,
Which one sees,
And as soon as it is in his hand,
He swallows it."
Isaiah,28,5,"In that day Yahweh of hosts will become a beautiful crown
And a glorious diadem to the remnant of His people"
Isaiah,28,6,"A spirit of just judgment for him who sits in judgment,
A might to those who turn back the onslaught at the gate."
Isaiah,28,7,"And these also reel with wine and stagger from strong drink:
The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink;
They are swallowed up by wine, they stagger from strong drink;
They reel while having visions;
They totter when rendering a verdict."
Isaiah,28,8,"For all the tables are full of filthy vomit, without a single clean place."
Isaiah,28,9,"¶“Whom would He instruct in knowledge,
And whom would He provide understanding about the report?
Those just weaned from milk?
Those just taken from the breast?"
Isaiah,28,10,"“For He says,
‘Order on order, order on order,
Line on line, line on line,
A little here, a little there.’ ”"
Isaiah,28,11,"Indeed, He will speak to this people
Through stammering lips and a foreign tongue"
Isaiah,28,12,"He who said to them, “Here is rest, give rest to the weary,”
And, “Here is repose,” but they would not listen."
Isaiah,28,13,"So the word of Yahweh to them will be,
“Order on order, order on order,
Line on line, line on line,
A little here, a little there,”
That they may go and stumble backward, be broken, snared, and taken captive."
Isaiah,28,14,"Therefore, hear the word of Yahweh, O scoffers,
Who rule this people who are in Jerusalem"
Isaiah,28,15,"Because you have said, “We have cut a covenant with death,
And with Sheol we have made a pact.
The overflowing scourge will not reach us when it passes by,
For we have made falsehood our refuge and we have hidden ourselves with lying.”"
Isaiah,28,16,"Therefore thus says Lord Yahweh,
“Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a tested stone,
A costly cornerstone for the foundation, firmly placed.
He who believes in it will not be disturbed."
Isaiah,28,17,"“I will make justice the measuring line
And righteousness the level;
Then hail will sweep away the refuge of falsehood,
And the waters will overflow the secret place."
Isaiah,28,18,"“Your covenant with death will be canceled,
And your pact with Sheol will not stand;
When the overflowing scourge passes through,
Then you will become its trampling place."
Isaiah,28,19,"“As often as it passes through, it will take you;
For morning after morning it will pass through, anytime during the day or night,
And it will be sheer terror to understand the report.”"
Isaiah,28,20,"The bed is too short on which to stretch out,
And the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in."
Isaiah,28,21,"For Yahweh will rise up as at Mount Perazim;
He will be stirred up as in the valley of Gibeon,
To work His work, His unusual work,
And to labor in His labor, His exceptional labor."
Isaiah,28,22,"So now do not carry on as scoffers,
Lest your fetters be made stronger;
For I have heard from Lord Yahweh of hosts
Of complete destruction, one that is decreed, on all the earth."
Isaiah,28,23,"¶Give ear and hear my voice,
Pay attention and hear my words."
Isaiah,28,24,"Does the farmer plow continually to plant seed?
Does he continually turn and harrow his ground?"
Isaiah,28,25,"Does he not level its surface
And sow dill and scatter cumin
And plant wheat in rows,
Barley in its place and rye within its area?"
Isaiah,28,26,For his God disciplines and teaches him proper judgment.
Isaiah,28,27,"For dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge,
Nor is the wheel of a cart driven over cumin;
But dill is beaten out with a staff, and cumin with a rod."
Isaiah,28,28,"Grain for bread is crushed,
But he does not continue to thresh it forever.
Because the wheel of his cart and his horses eventually disturb it,
He does not crush it longer."
Isaiah,28,29,"This also comes from Yahweh of hosts,
Who has made His counsel wonderful and His wisdom great."
Isaiah,29,1,"Woe, O Ariel, Ariel the city where David once camped!
Add year to year, observe your feasts on schedule."
Isaiah,29,2,"I will bring distress to Ariel,
And she will be a city of mourning and moaning;
And she will be like an Ariel to me."
Isaiah,29,3,"And I will camp against you encircling you,
And I will fortify siegeworks against you,
And I will raise up fortifications against you."
Isaiah,29,4,"Then you will be brought low;
From the earth you will speak,
And from the dust where you are prostrate
Your words will come.
Your voice will also be like that of a spirit from the ground,
And your speech will whisper from the dust."
Isaiah,29,5,"¶But it will be that the multitude of your enemies will become like fine dust,
And the multitude of the ruthless ones like the chaff which blows away;
And it will happen instantly, suddenly."
Isaiah,29,6,"From Yahweh of hosts you will be punished with thunder and earthquake and loud noise,
With whirlwind and tempest and the flame of a consuming fire."
Isaiah,29,7,"And it will be that the multitude of all the nations who wage war against Ariel,
Even all who wage war against her and her stronghold, and who distress her,
Will be like a dream, a vision of the night."
Isaiah,29,8,"And it will be as when a hungry man dreams—
And behold, he is eating;
But he awakens, and his soul is empty,
Or as when a thirsty man dreams—
And behold, he is drinking,
But he awakens, and behold, he is faint,
And his soul is not quenched.
Thus the multitude of all the nations will be
Who wage war against Mount Zion."
Isaiah,29,9,"¶Astonish yourselves and be astonished,
Blind yourselves and be blind;
They become drunk, but not with wine;
They stagger, but not with strong drink."
Isaiah,29,10,"For Yahweh has poured over you a spirit of deep sleep;
He has shut your eyes, the prophets;
And He has covered your heads, the seers."
Isaiah,29,11,"The entire vision will be to you like the words of a sealed book, which when they give it to the one who is literate, saying, “Please read this,” he will say, “I cannot, for it is sealed.”"

“Because this people draw near with their mouth
And honor Me with their lips,

And the discernment of their discerning men will be hidden.”"

And whose deeds are done in a dark place,
And they say, “Who sees us?” or “Who knows us?”"
Isaiah,29,16,"You turn things around!
Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay,
That what is made would say to its maker, “He did not make me”;
Or what is formed say to him who formed it, “He has no understanding”?"
Isaiah,29,17,"¶Is it not yet just a little while
Before Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful orchard,
And the fruitful orchard will be counted as a forest?"

And ensnare him who reproves at the gate,
And defraud the one in the right with meaningless arguments."

And will stand trembling before the God of Israel."

In order to add sin to sin"
Isaiah,30,2,"Who go down to Egypt—
But did not ask Me—
To find strength in the strong defense of Pharaoh
And to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!"

And the refuge in the shadow of Egypt, your dishonor."

And their messengers reach Hanes."

Through a land of distress and anguish,
From where come lioness and lion, viper and flying fiery serpent,
They carry their wealth on the backs of young donkeys
And their treasures on camels’ humps,
To a people who cannot profit them"
Isaiah,30,7,"Even Egypt, whose help is vain and empty.

That it may be in the time to come
As a witness forever."

Sons who are not willing to listen
To the law of Yahweh"

Speak to us pleasant words,
Behold visions of illusions."
Isaiah,30,11,"“Get out of the way, turn aside from the path,
Cease speaking before us about the Holy One of Israel.”"
Isaiah,30,12,"Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel,
“Since you have rejected this word
And have put your trust in oppression and deviousness and have relied on them"
Isaiah,30,13,"Therefore this iniquity will be to you
Like a breach about to fall,
A bulge in a high wall,
Whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant"
Isaiah,30,14,"Whose breaking is like the breaking of a potter’s jar,
So ruthlessly shattered
That a potsherd will not be found among its pieces
To take fire from a hearth
Or to scoop water from a cistern.”"
Isaiah,30,15,"For thus Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, has said,
“In repentance and rest you will be saved,
In quietness and trust is your might.”

His lips are filled with indignation
And His tongue is like a consuming fire"

And the descending of His arm to be seen in raging anger,
And in the flame of a consuming fire
In cloudburst, downpour, and hailstones."

When He strikes with the rod."

Isaiah,30,33,"For Topheth has long been ready,
Indeed, it has been prepared for the king.
He has made it deep and large,
A pyre of fire with plenty of wood;
The breath of Yahweh, like a torrent of brimstone, sets it afire."
Isaiah,31,1,"Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help
And rely on horses,
And trust in chariots because they are many
And in horsemen because they are very mighty,
But they do not regard at the Holy One of Israel, nor seek Yahweh!"

And does not turn His words aside,
But will arise against the house of evildoers
And against the help of the workers of iniquity."
Isaiah,31,3,"Now the Egyptians are men and not God,
And their horses are flesh and not spirit;
So Yahweh will stretch out His hand,
And he who helps will stumble,
And he who is helped will fall,
And all of them will come to an end together."
Isaiah,31,4,"For thus says Yahweh to me,
“As the lion or the young lion growls over its prey,
Against which a multitude of shepherds is called out,
And it will not be dismayed at their voice nor afflicted at their noise,
So will Yahweh of hosts come down to wage war on Mount Zion and on its hill.”"

He will defend and deliver it;
He will pass over and provide a way of escape."

And the ears of those who hear will pay attention."

And the tongue of the stammerers will hasten to speak clearly."
Isaiah,32,5,"No longer will the wicked fool be called noble,
Or the rogue be spoken of as generous."
Isaiah,32,6,"For a wicked fool speaks wicked folly,
And his heart does wickedness:
To do ungodliness and to speak error against Yahweh,
In order to make the hungry person empty;
He even causes the thirsty to lack a drink."
Isaiah,32,7,"As for a rogue, his weapons are evil;
He counsels wicked schemes
To wreak destruction on the afflicted with lying words,
Even though the needy one speaks justly."
Isaiah,32,8,"But the noble man counsels noble plans;
And by noble plans he rises up."
Isaiah,32,9,"¶Rise up, you women who are at ease,
And hear my voice;
Give ear to my word,
You complacent daughters."

You will quake, O complacent daughters;
For the grape harvest is ended,
And the fruit gathering will not come."

Quake, you complacent daughters;
Strip, undress, and put sackcloth on your waist"

Isaiah,32,13,"For the land of my people in which thorns and briars shall come up,
Indeed, against all the joyful houses and the exultant city."
Isaiah,32,14,"Because the palace has been abandoned, the populated city forsaken.
Hill and watchtower have become caves forever,
A joy for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks"
Isaiah,32,15,"Until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high,
And the wilderness becomes a fruitful orchard,
And the fruitful orchard is counted as a forest."
Isaiah,32,16,"Then justice will dwell in the wilderness,
And righteousness will live in the fruitful orchard."
Isaiah,32,17,"And the work of righteousness will be peace,
And the service of righteousness, quietness and security forever."

And in secure dwellings and in undisturbed resting places"
Isaiah,32,19,"And it will hail when the forest comes down,
And the city will be utterly laid low."

Who let out freely the ox and the donkey."
Isaiah,33,1,"Woe to you, O destroyer,
While you were not destroyed;
And he who is treacherous, while others did not deal treacherously with him.
As soon as you finish destroying, you will be destroyed;
As soon as you cease to deal treacherously, others will deal treacherously with you."

Be their strength every morning,
Our salvation also in the time of distress."

A wealth of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge;
The fear of Yahweh is his treasure."
Isaiah,33,7,"Behold, their brave men cry in the streets;
The messengers of peace weep bitterly."
Isaiah,33,8,"The highways are desolate, the traveler has ceased;
He has broken the covenant, he has rejected the cities;
He has no regard for man."
Isaiah,33,9,"The land mourns and languishes,
Lebanon is humiliated and withers;
Sharon is like a desert plain,
And Bashan and Carmel lose their foliage."
Isaiah,33,10,"“Now I will be on high,” says Yahweh,
“Now I will be lifted up, now I will be lifted up."
Isaiah,33,11,"“You have conceived chaff, you will give birth to stubble;
My breath will consume you like a fire."
Isaiah,33,12,"“The peoples will be burned to lime,
Like cut thorns which are burned in the fire."
Isaiah,33,13,"¶“You who are far away, hear what I have done;
And you who are near, acknowledge My might.”"
Isaiah,33,14,"Sinners in Zion are in dread;
Trembling has seized the godless.
“Who among us can sojourn with the consuming fire?
Who among us can sojourn with continual burning?”"
Isaiah,33,15,"He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly;
He who rejects greedy gain of oppression,
And shakes his hands so that they hold no bribe;
He who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed
And shuts his eyes from looking upon evil"
Isaiah,33,16,"He will dwell on the heights,
His refuge will be the strongholds of the cliffs;
His bread will be given him,
His water will be sure."
Isaiah,33,17,"¶Your eyes will behold the King in His beauty;
They will see a far-distant land."
Isaiah,33,18,"Your heart will meditate on terror:
“Where is he who counts?
Where is he who weighs?
Where is he who counts the towers?”"
Isaiah,33,19,"You will no longer see a fierce people,
A people of unintelligible speech which no one comprehends,
Of a stammering tongue which no one understands."
Isaiah,33,20,"Behold Zion, the city of our appointed times;
Your eyes will see Jerusalem, an abode at ease,
A tent which will not be folded;
Its stakes will never be pulled up,
Nor any of its cords ever be torn apart."
Isaiah,33,21,"But there the Mighty One, Yahweh, will be for us
A place of rivers and wide canals
On which no boat with oars will go,
And on which no mighty ship will pass"
Isaiah,33,22,"For Yahweh is our judge,
Yahweh is our lawgiver,
Yahweh is our king;
He will save us"
Isaiah,33,23,"Your cords hang slack;
They cannot hold the base of their mast firmly,
Nor spread out the sail.
Then the prey of an abundant spoil will be divided;
The lame will take the plunder."
Isaiah,33,24,"And no one who dwells there will say, “I am sick”;
The people who inhabit there will be forgiven their iniquity."
Isaiah,34,1,"Draw near, O nations, to hear; and pay attention, O peoples!
Let the earth hear, as well as its fullness, the world and all that springs from it."
Isaiah,34,2,"For the indignation of Yahweh is against all the nations,
And His wrath against all their hosts;
He has devoted them to destruction;
He has given them over to slaughter."
Isaiah,34,3,"So their slain will be cast out,
And their corpses will give off their stench,
And the mountains will be drenched with their blood."
Isaiah,34,4,"And all the host of heaven will rot away,
And the sky will be rolled up like a scroll;
All their hosts will also wither away
As a leaf withers from the vine,
Or as one withers from the fig tree."
Isaiah,34,5,"For My sword is satiated in heaven;
Behold, it shall descend for judgment upon Edom
And upon the people whom I have devoted to destruction."
Isaiah,34,6,"The sword of Yahweh is filled with blood;
It is sated with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats,
With the fat of the kidneys of rams.
For Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah
And a great slaughter in the land of Edom."
Isaiah,34,7,"And wild oxen will also fall with them,
And young bulls with strong ones;
Thus their land will be soaked with blood,
And their dust become greasy with fat."
Isaiah,34,8,"For Yahweh has a day of vengeance,
A year of recompense for the cause of Zion."
Isaiah,34,9,"And its streams will be turned into pitch,
And its dust into brimstone,
And its land will become burning pitch."
Isaiah,34,10,"It will not be quenched night or day;
Its smoke will go up forever.
From generation to generation it will be laid waste;
None will pass through it forever and ever."
Isaiah,34,11,"But pelican and hedgehog will possess it,
And owl and raven will dwell in it;
And He will stretch over it the line of utter formlessness
And the plumb line of utter void."
Isaiah,34,12,"Its nobles—there is no one there
Whom they may proclaim king—
And all its princes will be non-existent."
Isaiah,34,13,"And thorns will come up in its fortified towers,
Weeds and thistles in its fortified cities;
It will also be a haunt of jackals
And an abode of ostriches."
Isaiah,34,14,"And the desert creatures will meet with the wolves;
The hairy goat also will cry to its kind;
Surely, the night creature will obtain relief there
And will find itself a resting place."
Isaiah,34,15,"The owl will make its nest and find its escape there,
And it will hatch its eggs and gather them in its shade.
Surely, the falcons will be gathered there,
Every one with its kind."
Isaiah,34,16,"Seek from the book of Yahweh, and read:
Not one of these will be missing;
None will lack its mate.
For His mouth has commanded,
And His Spirit has gathered them."
Isaiah,34,17,"He has cast the lot for them,
And His hand has divided it to them by line.
They shall possess it forever;
From generation to generation they will dwell in it."
Isaiah,35,1,"The wilderness and the desert will be delighted,
And the Arabah will rejoice and flourish;
Like the crocus"
Isaiah,35,2,"It will flourish profusely
And rejoice with rejoicing and shout of joy.
The glory of Lebanon will be given to it,
The majesty of Carmel and Sharon.
They will see the glory of Yahweh,
The majesty of our God."
Isaiah,35,3,"Strengthen limp hands, and give courage to the knees of the stumbling."
Isaiah,35,4,"Say to those with an anxious heart,
“Be strong, fear not.
Behold, your God will come with vengeance;
The recompense of God will come,
But He will save you.”"
Isaiah,35,5,"Then the eyes of the blind will be opened,
And the ears of the deaf will be unstopped."
Isaiah,35,6,"Then the lame will leap like a deer,
And the tongue of the mute will shout for joy.
For waters will break forth in the wilderness
And streams in the Arabah."
Isaiah,35,7,"Then the scorched land will become a pool
And the thirsty ground springs of water;
In the haunt of jackals, its resting place,
Grass becomes reeds and rushes."
Isaiah,35,8,"And a roadway will be there, a highway,
And it will be called the Highway of Holiness.
The unclean will not pass by on it,
But it will be for him who walks in that way,
And ignorant fools will not wander on it."
Isaiah,35,9,"No lion will be there,
Nor will any vicious beast go up on it;
These will not be found there.
But the redeemed will walk there"
Isaiah,35,10,"And the ransomed of Yahweh will return
And come with joyful shouting to Zion,
With everlasting gladness upon their heads.
They will attain delight and gladness,
And sorrow and sighing will flee away."
Isaiah,36,1,"Now it happened in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and seized them."
Isaiah,36,2,And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a heavy military force. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway of the fuller’s field.
Isaiah,36,3,"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to him."
Isaiah,36,4,"Then Rabshakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, “What is this trust that you have?"
Isaiah,36,5,"I say, ‘Your counsel and might for the war are only empty words.’ Now in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?"
Isaiah,36,6,"Behold, you trust in the staff of this crushed reed, even on Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him."
Isaiah,36,7,"But if you say to me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our God,’ is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar’?"
Isaiah,36,8,"So now, come make a bargain with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to give riders for them."
Isaiah,36,9,How then can you turn away one official of the least of my master’s servants and trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
Isaiah,36,10,"So now, have I come up without the approval of Yahweh against this land to make it a ruin? Yahweh said to me, ‘Go up against this land and make it a ruin.’ ” ’ ”"
Isaiah,36,11,"Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Speak now to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak with us in Judean in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”"
Isaiah,36,12,"But Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, doomed to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?”"
Isaiah,36,13,"Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in Judean and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria."
Isaiah,36,14,"Thus says the king, ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you"
Isaiah,36,15,"and do not let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, “Yahweh will surely deliver us, this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”"
Isaiah,36,16,"Do not listen to Hezekiah,’ for thus says the king of Assyria, ‘Make your peace with me and come out to me, and eat each of his vine and each of his fig tree, and drink each of the waters of his own cistern"
Isaiah,36,17,"until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards."
Isaiah,36,18,"Beware lest Hezekiah mislead you, saying, “Yahweh will deliver us.” Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?"
Isaiah,36,19,Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And when have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
Isaiah,36,20,"Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their land from my hand, that Yahweh would deliver Jerusalem from my hand?’ ”"
Isaiah,36,21,"But they were silent and answered him not a word, for the king’s commandment was, “Do not answer him.”"
Isaiah,36,22,"Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of Rabshakeh."
Isaiah,37,1,"Now it happened that when King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and entered the house of Yahweh."
Isaiah,37,2,"Then he sent Eliakim, who was over the household with Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz."
Isaiah,37,3,"And they said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day is a day of distress, reproof, and rejection; for children have come to the point of breaking forth, but there is no strength to give birth."
Isaiah,37,4,"Perhaps Yahweh your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore, lift up a prayer for the remnant that is left.’ ”"
Isaiah,37,5,So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
Isaiah,37,6,"And Isaiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to your master, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the young men of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me."
Isaiah,37,7,"Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he will hear a report and return to his own land. And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.” ’ ”"
Isaiah,37,8,"Then Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had set out from Lachish."
Isaiah,37,9,"Then he heard them say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He has come out to fight against you.” So he heard it and sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying"
Isaiah,37,10,"“Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”"
Isaiah,37,11,"Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, devoting them to destruction. So will you be delivered?"
Isaiah,37,12,"Did the gods of those nations, which my fathers have brought to ruin, deliver them, even Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?"
Isaiah,37,13,"Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and of Hena and Ivvah?’ ”"
Isaiah,37,14,"Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went up to the house of Yahweh and spread it out before Yahweh."
Isaiah,37,15,And Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh saying
Isaiah,37,16,"“O Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, who is enthroned above the cherubim, You are the God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth."
Isaiah,37,17,"Incline Your ear, O Yahweh, and hear; open Your eyes, O Yahweh, and see; and listen to all the words of Sennacherib, who sent them to reproach the living God."
Isaiah,37,18,"Truly, O Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste to all the countries and their lands"
Isaiah,37,19,"and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. So they have destroyed them."
Isaiah,37,20,"But now, O Yahweh our God, save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are Yahweh, You alone.”"
Isaiah,37,21,"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent word to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘Because you have prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria"
Isaiah,37,22,"this is the word that Yahweh has spoken against him:
“She has despised you and mocked you,
The virgin daughter of Zion;
She has shaken her head behind you,
The daughter of Jerusalem!"
Isaiah,37,23,"“Whom have you reproached and blasphemed?
And against whom have you heightened your voice
And haughtily lifted up your eyes?
Against the Holy One of Israel!"
Isaiah,37,24,"“Through your servants you have reproached the Lord,
And you have said, ‘With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains,
To the remotest parts of Lebanon;
And I cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypresses.
And I will go to its highest peak, its thickest forest."
Isaiah,37,25,"‘I dug wells and drank waters,
And with the sole of my feet I dried up
All the rivers of Egypt.’"
Isaiah,37,26,"“Have you not heard?
Long ago I did it;
From days of old I formed it.
Now I have brought it to pass,
That you should devastate fortified cities into ruinous heaps."
Isaiah,37,27,"“So their inhabitants were short of power;
They were dismayed and put to shame;
They were as the plant of the field and as the green herb,
As grass on the rooftops is scorched before it rises."
Isaiah,37,28,"“But I know your sitting down
And your going out and your coming in
And your raging against Me."
Isaiah,37,29,"“Because of your raging against Me
And because your presumptuousness has come up to My ears,
Therefore I will put My hook in your nose
And My bridle in your lips,
And I will turn you back by the way which you came."
Isaiah,37,30,"“Then this shall be the sign for you: you will eat this year what grows of its own accord, in the second year what springs from the same, and in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit."
Isaiah,37,31,And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
Isaiah,37,32,For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant and out of Mount Zion survivors. The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will do this.” ’
Isaiah,37,33,"“Therefore, thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria, ‘He will not come to this city or shoot an arrow there; and he will not come before it with a shield or throw up a siege ramp against it."
Isaiah,37,34,"By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he will not come to this city,’ declares Yahweh."
Isaiah,37,35,‘Indeed I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.’ ”
Isaiah,37,36,"Then the angel of Yahweh went out and struck 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians. And the men arose early in the morning, and behold, all of them were dead bodies."
Isaiah,37,37,So Sennacherib king of Assyria set out and returned home and lived at Nineveh.
Isaiah,37,38,"Now it happened that as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him down with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son became king in his place."
Isaiah,38,1,"In those days Hezekiah became ill to the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.’ ”"
Isaiah,38,2,Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh
Isaiah,38,3,"and said, “Remember now, O Yahweh, I beseech You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a whole heart and have done what is good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept greatly."
Isaiah,38,4,"Then the word of Yahweh came to Isaiah, saying"
Isaiah,38,5,"“Go and say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of your father David, “I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears; behold, I will add fifteen years to your life."
Isaiah,38,6,And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city.” ’

Isaiah,38,9,A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery
Isaiah,38,10,"I said, “In the middle of my life
I am to enter the gates of Sheol;
I am to be deprived of the rest of my years.”"
Isaiah,38,11,"I said, “I will not see Yah,
Yah in the land of the living;
I will look on man no more among the inhabitants of the world."
Isaiah,38,12,"“Like a shepherd’s tent my dwelling is pulled up and removed from me;
As a weaver I rolled up my life.
He cuts me off from the loom;
From day until night You make an end of me."
Isaiah,38,13,"“I soothed my soul until morning.
Like a lion—so He shatters all my bones;
From day until night You make an end of me."
Isaiah,38,14,"“Like a swallow, like a crane, so I chirped;
I moan like a dove;
My eyes look wistfully to the heights;
O Lord, I am oppressed, be my security."
Isaiah,38,15,"¶“What shall I say?
Indeed, He has spoken to me, and He Himself has done it;
I will wander about all my years because of the bitterness of my soul."
Isaiah,38,16,"“O Lord, by these things men live,
And in all these is the life of my spirit;
O restore me to health and let me live!"
Isaiah,38,17,"¶“Behold, for my own well-being I had great bitterness;
But it is You who has held back my soul from the pit of nothingness,
For You have cast all my sins behind Your back."
Isaiah,38,18,"“For Sheol cannot thank You;
Death cannot praise You;
Those who go down to the pit cannot keep watch for Your truth."
Isaiah,38,19,"“It is the living, the living who give thanks to You, as I do today;
A father makes known to his sons about Your truth."
Isaiah,38,20,"“Yahweh is here to save me;
So we will play my songs on stringed instruments
All the days of our life at the house of Yahweh.”"
Isaiah,38,21,"Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take up a cake of figs and apply it to the boil, that he may live.”"
Isaiah,38,22,"Then Hezekiah had said, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of Yahweh?”"
Isaiah,39,1,"At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and was growing stronger."
Isaiah,39,2,"And Hezekiah was glad about these things and showed them all his treasure house, the silver and the gold and the spices and the good oil and his whole armory and all that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them."
Isaiah,39,3,"Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where have they come to you?” And Hezekiah said, “They have come to me from a far country, from Babylon.”"
Isaiah,39,4,"And he said, “What have they seen in your house?” So Hezekiah said, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasuries that I have not shown them.”"
Isaiah,39,5,"Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of Yahweh of hosts"
Isaiah,39,6,"‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house and all that your fathers have treasured up to this day will be carried to Babylon; nothing will be left,’ says Yahweh."
Isaiah,39,7,"‘And some of your sons who will issue from you, whom you will beget, will be taken away, and they will become officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.’ ”"
Isaiah,39,8,"Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of Yahweh which you have spoken is good.” For he said, “For there will be peace and truth in my days.”"
Isaiah,40,1,"“Comfort, O comfort My people,” says your God."
Isaiah,40,2,"“Speak to the heart of Jerusalem;
And call out to her, that her warfare has been fulfilled,
That her iniquity has been removed,

Double for all her sins.”"

And let the rough ground become a plain,
And the rugged terrain a broad valley"
Isaiah,40,5,"Then the glory of Yahweh will be revealed,
And all flesh will see it together;
For the mouth of Yahweh has spoken.”"
Isaiah,40,6,"A voice says, “Call out.”
Then he answered, “What shall I call out?”
All flesh is grass, and all its lovingkindness is like the flower of the field."
Isaiah,40,7,"The grass withers, the flower fades,
When the breath of Yahweh blows upon it;
Surely the people are grass."
Isaiah,40,8,"The grass withers, the flower fades,
But the word of our God stands forever."

He will gently lead the nursing ewes."
Isaiah,40,12,"¶Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand,
And encompassed the heavens by the span,

And the hills in a pair of scales?"
Isaiah,40,13,"Who has encompassed the Spirit of Yahweh,
Or as His counselor has informed Him?"

Isaiah,40,19,"As for the graven images, a craftsman casts it,
A goldsmith plates it with gold,
And a silversmith fashions chains of silver."

Chooses a tree that does not rot;
He seeks out for himself a wise craftsman
To prepare a graven image that will not be shaken."

Has it not been declared to you from the beginning?
Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?"

That I would be his equal?” says the Holy One."
Isaiah,40,26,"Lift up your eyes on high

The One who leads forth their host by number,
He calls them all by name;
Because of the greatness of His vigor and the strength of His power,
Not one of them is missing."
Isaiah,40,27,"¶Why do you say, O Jacob, and assert, O Israel,
“My way is hidden from Yahweh,
And the justice due me passes by my God”?"

And he will come upon officials as upon mortar,
Even as the potter treads clay.”"
Isaiah,41,26,"Who has declared this from the beginning, that we might know?
Or from former times, that we may say, “He is right!”?
Surely there was no one who declared;
Surely there was no one who caused those words to be heard;
Surely there was no one who heard your words."

These things you did not put on your heart

Loss of children and widowhood.
They will come on you in full measure
In spite of your many sorceries,
In spite of the great might of your spells."

Those who behold visions by the stars,
Those who predict by the new moons,

And are supported by the God of Israel;
Yahweh of hosts is His name."
Isaiah,48,3,"“I declared the former things long ago,
And they went forth from My mouth, and I caused them to be heard.
Suddenly I acted, and they came to pass."
Isaiah,48,4,"“Because I know that you are stiff,
And your neck is an iron sinew
And your forehead bronze"
Isaiah,48,5,"Therefore I declared them to you long ago,
Before they happened I caused them to be heard by you,
Lest you say, ‘My idol has done them,
And my graven image and my molten image have commanded them.’"

And before today you have not heard them,
Lest you say, ‘Behold, I knew them.’"

In Whom I will show forth My beautiful glory.”"

Yet surely the justice due to Me is with Yahweh,
And My reward with My God.”"

And My God is My strength)"
Isaiah,49,6,"He says, “It is too small a thing that You should be My Servant
To raise up the tribes of Jacob and to cause the preserved ones of Israel to return;
I will also give You as a light of the nations
So that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”"
Isaiah,49,7,"Thus says Yahweh, the Redeemer of Israel and its Holy One,
To the despised One,
To the One abhorred by the nation,
To the Servant of rulers,

Princes will also bow down,
Because of Yahweh who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel who has chosen You.”"
Isaiah,49,8,"Thus says Yahweh,

From where did these come?’ ”"

Isaiah,49,24,"¶“Can the prey be taken from the mighty man,
Or the captives of the righteous be granted escape?”"
Isaiah,49,25,"Surely, thus says Yahweh,

And the prey of the tyrant will be granted escape;
For I will contend with the one who contends with you,
And I will save your sons."
Isaiah,49,26,"“I will feed those who mistreat you with their own flesh,
And they will become drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine;
And all flesh will know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior

Behold, you were sold for your iniquities,
And for your transgressions your mother was sent away."
Isaiah,50,2,"“Why was there no man when I came?
When I called, why was there none to answer?

I make the rivers a wilderness;
Their fish stink for lack of water
And die of thirst."
Isaiah,50,3,"“I clothe the heavens with blackness
And make sackcloth their covering.”"
Isaiah,50,4,"¶Lord Yahweh has given Me the tongue of disciples,
That I may know how to sustain the weary one with a word.
He awakens Me morning by morning;

And I did not rebel
Nor did I turn back."
Isaiah,50,6,"I gave My back to those who strike Me,
And My cheeks to those who pluck out the beard;

Therefore, I am not dishonored;
Therefore, I have set My face like flint,

Awake as in the days of old, the generations of long ago.

The waters of the great deep,
Who made the depths of the sea a pathway
For the redeemed to cross over?"

And come with joyful shouting to Zion,
And everlasting gladness will be on their heads.
They will obtain joy and gladness,

Who are you that you are afraid of man who dies
And of the son of man who is made like grass"

Who will console you?
The devastation and destruction, famine and sword;
How shall I comfort you?"

They lie helpless at the head of every street,
Like an antelope in a net,
Full of the wrath of Yahweh,
The rebuke of your God."

Who are drunk, but not with wine"
Isaiah,51,22,"Thus says your Lord, Yahweh, even your God
Who contends for His people,

The chalice of My wrath;
You will never drink it again."
Isaiah,51,23,"“I will set it into the hand of those who cause you grief,
Who have said to you, ‘Lie down that we may walk over you.’
You have even set your back down like the ground
And like the street for those who walk over it.”"

Isaiah,52,3,"For thus says Yahweh, “You were sold for nothing, and you will be redeemed without money.”"
Isaiah,52,4,"For thus says Lord Yahweh, “My people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there; then the Assyrian oppressed them without cause."
Isaiah,52,5,"So now, what do I have here,” declares Yahweh, “since My people have been taken away for nothing?” Yahweh declares, “Those who rule over them howl, and My name is continually blasphemed all day long."
Isaiah,52,6,"Therefore My people shall know My name; therefore in that day I am the one who is speaking, ‘Here I am.’ ”"

Are the feet of him who proclaims good news,
Who announces peace
And proclaims good news of good things,
Who announces salvation,

When Yahweh returns to Zion."

You waste places of Jerusalem;
For Yahweh has comforted His people;
He has redeemed Jerusalem."

In the sight of all the nations,
That all the ends of the earth may see
The salvation of our God."

Touch nothing unclean;
Go out of the midst of her, purify yourselves,
You who carry the vessels of Yahweh."

Nor will you go as those who flee;
For Yahweh will go before you,
And the God of Israel will be your rear guard."
Isaiah,52,13,"¶Behold, My Servant will prosper;
He will be high and lifted up and greatly exalted."
Isaiah,52,14,"Just as many were appalled at you, My people,
So His appearance was marred more than any man
And His form more than the sons of men."
Isaiah,52,15,"Thus He will sprinkle many nations,
Kings will shut their mouths on account of Him;
For what had not been told them they will see,
And what they had not heard they will understand."
Isaiah,53,1,"Who has believed our report?
And to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?"
Isaiah,53,2,"For He grew up before Him like a tender shoot,
And like a root out of parched ground;
He has no stately form or majesty
That we should look upon Him,
Nor appearance that we should desire Him."
Isaiah,53,3,"He was despised and forsaken of men,
A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;
And like one from whom men hide their face
He was despised, and we did not esteem Him."

And our sorrows He carried;
Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken,
Smitten of God, and afflicted."

He was crushed for our iniquities;
The chastening for our peace fell upon Him,
And by His wounds we are healed."

Each of us has turned to his own way;
But Yahweh has caused the iniquity of us all
To fall on Him."

Yet He did not open His mouth;
Like a lamb that is led to slaughter,
And like a sheep that is silent before its shearers,
So He did not open His mouth."
Isaiah,53,8,"By oppression and judgment He was taken away;
And as for His generation, who considered
That He was cut off out of the land of the living,
That for the transgression of my people, striking was due to Him?"
Isaiah,53,9,"So His grave was assigned with wicked men,
Yet He was with a rich man in His death,
Because He had done no violence,
Nor was there any deceit in His mouth."
Isaiah,53,10,"¶But Yahweh was pleased
To crush Him, putting Him to grief;
If You would place His soul as a guilt offering,
He will see His seed,
He will prolong His days,
And the good pleasure of Yahweh will succeed in His hand."
Isaiah,53,11,"As a result of the anguish of His soul,
He will see it and be satisfied;
By His knowledge the Righteous One,
My Servant, will justify the many,
As He will bear their iniquities."
Isaiah,53,12,"Therefore, I will divide for Him a portion with the many,
And He will divide the spoil with the strong;
Because He poured out His soul to death,
And was numbered with the transgressors;
Yet He Himself bore the sin of many,
And interceded for the transgressors."
Isaiah,54,1,"“Shout for joy, O barren woman, who has not given birth;

And strengthen your pegs."

And your seed will possess nations
And will resettle the desolate cities."

And do not feel dishonored, for you will not be humiliated;

Whose name is Yahweh of hosts;
And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel,
Who is called the God of all the earth."

When I swore that the waters of Noah
Would not overflow the earth again;
So I have sworn that I will not be furious with you
Nor will I rebuke you."

Whoever attacks you will fall because of you."

And brings out a weapon for its work;
And I have created the bringer of ruin to wreak destruction."

And every tongue that accuses you in judgment you will condemn.
This is the inheritance of the slaves of Yahweh,
And their righteousness is from Me,” declares Yahweh."
Isaiah,55,1,"“Ho! Every one who thirsts, come to the waters;
And you who have no money come, buy and eat.
Come, buy wine and milk
Without money and without cost."

And your wages for what does not satisfy?
Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good,
And delight your soul in richness."

Listen, that your soul may live;

A ruler and commander for the peoples."

Nor are your ways My ways,” declares Yahweh."
Isaiah,55,9,"“For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
So are My ways higher than your ways
And My thoughts than your thoughts."

And do not return there without watering the earth
And making it bear and sprout,
And giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater"
Isaiah,55,11,"So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth;
It will not return to Me empty,
Without accomplishing what pleases Me,
And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it."
Isaiah,55,12,"“For you will go out with gladness
And be led forth with peace;
The mountains and the hills will break forth into shouts of joy before you,
And all the trees of the field will clap their hands."
Isaiah,55,13,"“Instead of the thorn bush the cypress will come up,

All you beasts in the forest,
Come to eat."

Against whom do you open wide your mouth
And stick out your tongue?
Are you not children of transgression,
Seed of lying"
Isaiah,57,5,"Who inflame yourselves among the oaks,
Under every green tree,
Who slaughter the children in the ravines,
Under the clefts of the cliffs?"
Isaiah,57,6,"“Among the smooth stones of the ravine
Is your portion, they are your lot;
Even to them you have poured out a drink offering;
You have made a grain offering.
Shall I relent concerning these things?"
Isaiah,57,7,"“Upon a mountain lofty and lifted up
You have made your bed.
You also went up there to offer sacrifice."
Isaiah,57,8,"“Behind the door and the doorpost

You have loved their bed;
You have looked on their manhood."

And increased your perfumes;
You have sent your envoys a great distance
And made them go down to Sheol."

Yet you did not say, ‘It is hopeless.’
You found renewed strength;
Therefore you did not faint."
Isaiah,57,11,"¶“Of whom were you anxious and fearful
When you lied and did not remember Me,
Nor even put Me upon your heart?
Was I not silent even for a long time
So you do not fear Me?"
Isaiah,57,12,"“I will declare your righteousness and your deeds,
But they will not profit you."
Isaiah,57,13,"“When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you.

And will possess My holy mountain.”"
Isaiah,57,14,"¶And it will be said,
“Build up, build up, prepare the way,
Remove every stumbling block out of the way of My people.”"

Who dwells forever, whose name is Holy,
“I dwell on a high and holy place,
And also with the crushed and lowly of spirit
In order to revive the spirit of the lowly
And to revive the heart of the crushed."

Nor will I always be angry;
For the spirit would grow faint before Me,
And the breath of those whom I have made."

I hid My face and was angry,
And he went on turning away, in the way of his heart."

Raise your voice like a trumpet,
And declare to My people their transgression
And to the house of Jacob their sins."
Isaiah,58,2,"“Yet they seek Me day by day and find pleasure in knowing My ways,
As a nation that has done righteousness
And has not forsaken the judgment of their God.
They ask Me for righteous judgments;
They find pleasure in the nearness of God."

Why have we afflicted our souls and You do not know?’
Behold, on the day of your fast you find your desire,
And oppress all your workers."
Isaiah,58,4,"“Behold, you fast for contention and quarreling and to strike with a wicked fist.
You do not fast like you do today to make your voice heard on high."
Isaiah,58,5,"“Is it a fast like this which I choose, a day for a man to afflict himself?
Is it for bowing one’s head like a reed
And for spreading out sackcloth and ashes as a bed?
Will you call this a fast, even an acceptable day to Yahweh?"
Isaiah,58,6,"“Is this not the fast which I choose,
To loosen the bonds of wickedness,
To release the bands of the yoke,
And to let the oppressed go free
And break every yoke?"
Isaiah,58,7,"“Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry
And bring the afflicted homeless into the house;
When you see the naked, you cover him;
And not to hide yourself from your own flesh?"
Isaiah,58,8,"“Then your light will break out like the dawn,
And your recovery will speedily spring forth;
And your righteousness will go before you;
The glory of Yahweh will be your rear guard."
Isaiah,58,9,"“Then you will call, and Yahweh will answer;
You will cry, and He will say, ‘Here I am.’
If you remove the yoke from your midst,
The pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness"

And satisfy the soul of the afflicted,
Then your light will rise in darkness
And your thick darkness will become like midday."

And satisfy your soul in scorched places,
And fortify your bones;
And you will be like a watered garden,
And like a spring of water whose waters do not fail."
Isaiah,58,12,"“Those from among you will rebuild the ancient waste places;
You will raise up the foundations of past generation upon generation;
And you will be called the repairer of the breach,
The restorer of the paths for one to inhabit."
Isaiah,58,13,"¶“If because of the sabbath, you turn your foot
From doing your own desire on My holy day,
And call the sabbath a delight, the holy day of Yahweh honorable,
And honor it, by not doing your own ways,
By not finding your own desire
And speaking your own word"
Isaiah,58,14,"Then you will take delight in Yahweh,
And I will make you ride on the heights of the earth;
And I will feed you with the inheritance of Jacob your father,
For the mouth of Yahweh has spoken.”"
Isaiah,59,1,"Behold, the hand of Yahweh is not so short
That it cannot save;
Nor is His ear so dull
That it cannot hear."
Isaiah,59,2,"But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God,
And your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not hear."
Isaiah,59,3,"For your hands are defiled with blood
And your fingers with iniquity;
Your lips have spoken a lie;
Your tongue mutters unrighteousness."
Isaiah,59,4,"No one calls in righteousness, and no one seeks justice in truth.
They trust in confusion and speak worthlessness;
They conceive trouble and give birth to wickedness."

He who eats of their eggs dies,
And from that which is crushed a snake breaks forth."
Isaiah,59,6,"Their webs will not become a garment,
Nor will they cover themselves with their works;
Their works are works of wickedness,
And a deed of violence is in their hands."
Isaiah,59,7,"Their feet run to evil,
And they are quick to shed innocent blood;
Their thoughts are thoughts of wickedness;
Devastation and destruction are in their highways."
Isaiah,59,8,"They do not know the way of peace,
And there is no justice in their tracks;
They have made their paths crooked,
Whoever treads on them does not know peace."
Isaiah,59,9,"¶Therefore justice is far from us,
And righteousness does not overtake us;
We hope for light, but behold, darkness,
For brightness, but we walk in thick darkness."
Isaiah,59,10,"We grope along the wall like blind men;
We grope like those who have no eyes;
We stumble at midday as in the twilight,
Among those who are vigorous we are like dead men."
Isaiah,59,11,"All of us growl like bears,
And moan sadly like doves;
We hope for justice, but there is none,
For salvation, but it is far from us."
Isaiah,59,12,"For our transgressions are multiplied before You,
And our sins answer against us;
For our transgressions are with us,
And we know our iniquities"
Isaiah,59,13,"Transgressing and denying Yahweh,
And turning back from our God,
Speaking oppression and revolt,
Conceiving in and uttering from the heart lying words."
Isaiah,59,14,"Justice is turned back,
And righteousness stands far away;
For truth has stumbled in the street,
And rightness cannot enter."
Isaiah,59,15,"So it is that truth is missing;
And he who turns aside from evil makes himself plunder.
T hen Yahweh saw,
And it was evil in His eyes that there was no justice."
Isaiah,59,16,"And He saw that there was no man,
And was astonished that there was no one to intercede;
Then His own arm brought salvation to Him,
And His righteousness upheld Him."
Isaiah,59,17,"He put on righteousness like a breastplate,
And a helmet of salvation on His head;
And He put on garments of vengeance for clothing
And wrapped Himself with zeal as a mantle."
Isaiah,59,18,"According to what they deserve, so He will pay in full,
Wrath to His adversaries, what is deserved to His enemies;
To the coastlands He will pay what they deserve."

And His glory from the rising of the sun,
For He will come like a rushing stream
Which the wind of Yahweh makes flee."

And to those who turn from transgression in Jacob,” declares Yahweh."
Isaiah,59,21,"“As for Me, this is My covenant with them,” says Yahweh: “My Spirit which is upon you, and My words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your seed, nor from the mouth of your seed’s seed,” says Yahweh, “from now and forever.”"

And their kings will minister to you;
For in My wrath I struck you,
And in My favor I have had compassion on you."

They will not be closed day or night,
So that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations,
With their kings led in procession."

And the nations will surely be laid waste."

With no one passing through,
I will make you an everlasting pride,

And righteousness your taskmasters."
Isaiah,60,18,"“Violence will not be heard again in your land,
Nor devastation or destruction within your borders;
But you will call your walls salvation, and your gates praise."

They will possess the land forever,
The branch of My planting,
The work of My hands,
That I may show forth My beautiful glory."

And the miniscule one a mighty nation.
I, Yahweh, will hasten it in its time.”"

Because Yahweh has anointed me
To bring good news to the afflicted;
He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
To proclaim release to captives
And freedom to prisoners"
Isaiah,61,2,"To proclaim the favorable year of Yahweh
And the day of vengeance of our God,
To comfort all who mourn"
Isaiah,61,3,"To grant those who mourn in Zion,
Giving them a headdress instead of ashes,

And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride,
So your God will rejoice over you."
Isaiah,62,6,"¶On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen;
All day and all night they will never keep silent.
You who remind Yahweh, take no rest for yourselves"
Isaiah,62,7,"And give Him no rest until He establishes
And sets Jerusalem as a praise in the earth."
Isaiah,62,8,"Yahweh has sworn by His right hand and by His strong arm,
“I will never again give your grain as food for your enemies;
Nor will foreigners drink your new wine for which you have labored.”"
Isaiah,62,9,"But those who collect it will eat it and praise Yahweh;
And those who gather it will drink it in the courts of My sanctuary."
Isaiah,62,10,"¶Go through, go through the gates,
Clear the way for the people;
Build up, build up the highway,
Remove the stones, raise up a standard over the peoples."
Isaiah,62,11,"Behold, Yahweh has announced to the end of the earth,
Say to the daughter of Zion, “Behold, your salvation comes;
Behold, His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him.”"
Isaiah,62,12,"And they will call them, “The holy people,
The redeemed of Yahweh”;
And you will be called, “Sought out, a city not forsaken.”"
Isaiah,63,1,"Who is this who comes from Edom,
With garments of glowing colors from Bozrah,
This One who is majestic in His clothing,
Marching in the greatness of His power?
“It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.”"
Isaiah,63,2,"Why is Your clothing red,
And Your garments like the one who treads in the wine press?"
Isaiah,63,3,"“I have trodden the wine trough alone,
And from the peoples there was no man with Me.
I also trod them in My anger
And trampled them in My wrath;
And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments,
And I stained all My clothes."
Isaiah,63,4,"“For the day of vengeance was in My heart,
And My year of redemption has come."
Isaiah,63,5,"“I looked, and there was no one to help,
And I was astonished, and there was no one to uphold;
So My own arm brought salvation to Me,
And My wrath upheld Me."
Isaiah,63,6,"“I trod down the peoples in My anger
And made them drunk in My wrath,
And I brought down their lifeblood to the earth.”"
Isaiah,63,7,"¶I shall bring to remembrance the lovingkindnesses of Yahweh, the praises of Yahweh,
According to all the ways that Yahweh has dealt bountifully with us,
And the abundant goodness toward the house of Israel,
Which He has dealt bountifully to them according to His compassion
And according to the abundance of His lovingkindnesses."
Isaiah,63,8,"And He said, “Surely, they are My people,
Sons who will not deal falsely.”
So He became their Savior."
Isaiah,63,9,"In all their distress He was distressed,
And the angel of His presence saved them;
In His love and in His mercy He redeemed them,
And He lifted them and carried them all the ancient days."
Isaiah,63,10,"But they rebelled
And grieved His Holy Spirit;
Therefore He turned Himself to become their enemy;
He fought against them."
Isaiah,63,11,"Then His people remembered the ancient days, of Moses.
Where is He who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of His flock?
Where is He who put His Holy Spirit in the midst of them"
Isaiah,63,12,"Who caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses,
Who split the waters before them to make for Himself an everlasting name"
Isaiah,63,13,"Who led them through the depths?
Like the horse in the wilderness, they did not stumble"
Isaiah,63,14,"As the cattle which go down into the valley,
The Spirit of Yahweh gave them rest.
So You led Your people,
To make for Yourself a glorious name."
Isaiah,63,15,"¶Look down from heaven and see from Your holy and glorious habitation;
Where are Your zeal and Your mighty deeds?
The tumults within You and Your compassion are restrained toward me."
Isaiah,63,16,"For You are our Father, though Abraham does not know us
And Israel does not recognize us.
You, O Yahweh, are our Father,
Our Redeemer from everlasting is Your name."
Isaiah,63,17,"Why, O Yahweh, do You cause us to stray from Your ways
And stiffen our heart from fearing You?
Return for the sake of Your slaves, the tribes of Your inheritance."
Isaiah,63,18,"Your holy people possessed Your sanctuary for a little while;
Our adversaries have trodden it down."
Isaiah,63,19,"We have become like those over whom You have never ruled,
Like those who were not called by Your name."
Isaiah,64,1,"Oh, that You would rend the heavens and come down,
That the mountains might quake at Your presence"
Isaiah,64,2,"As fire kindles the brushwood, as fire causes water to boil—
To make Your name known to Your adversaries,
That the nations may tremble at Your presence!"
Isaiah,64,3,"When You did awesome things for which we did not hope,
You came down; the mountains quaked at Your presence."
Isaiah,64,4,"For from ancient times they have not heard or given ear,
Nor has the eye seen a God besides You,
Who acts in behalf of the one who waits for Him."
Isaiah,64,5,"You meet him who rejoices and does righteousness,
Who remembers You in Your ways.
Behold, You were angry; indeed we have sinned—
We continued in them a long time—
And shall we be saved?"
Isaiah,64,6,"For all of us have become like one who is unclean,
And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment;
And all of us wither like a leaf,
And our iniquities, like the wind, carry us away."
Isaiah,64,7,"There is no one who calls on Your name,
Who awakens himself to take hold of You,
For You have hidden Your face from us
And have melted us into the hand of our iniquities."
Isaiah,64,8,"¶But now, O Yahweh, You are our Father;
We are the clay, and You our potter;
And all of us are the work of Your hand."
Isaiah,64,9,"Do not be angry beyond measure, O Yahweh,
Nor remember iniquity forever;
Behold, look now, all of us are Your people."
Isaiah,64,10,"Your holy cities have become a wilderness;
Zion has become a wilderness,
Jerusalem a desolation."
Isaiah,64,11,"Our holy and glorious house,
Where our fathers praised You,
Has been burned by fire;
And all our precious things have become a waste place."
Isaiah,64,12,"Will You restrain Yourself at these things, O Yahweh?
Will You keep silent and afflict us beyond measure?"
Isaiah,65,1,"“I permitted Myself to be sought by those who did not ask for Me;
I permitted Myself to be found by those who did not seek Me.
I said, ‘Here am I, here am I,’
To a nation which did not call on My name."
Isaiah,65,2,"“I have spread out My hands all day long to a rebellious people,
Who walk in the way which is not good, following their own thoughts"
Isaiah,65,3,"A people who continually provoke Me to My face,
Offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on bricks"
Isaiah,65,4,"Who sit among graves and spend the night in secret places,
Who eat swine’s flesh,
And the broth of offensive meat is in their pots"
Isaiah,65,5,"Who say, ‘Keep to yourself, do not come near me,
For I am holier than you!’
These are smoke in My nostrils,
A fire that burns all the day."
Isaiah,65,6,"“Behold, it is written before Me:
I will not keep silent, but I will repay;
I will even repay into their bosom"
Isaiah,65,7,"Both their own iniquities and the iniquities of their fathers together,” says Yahweh.
“Because they have burned incense on the mountains
And reproached Me on the hills,
Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom.”"
Isaiah,65,8,"Thus says Yahweh,
“As the new wine is found in the cluster,
And one says, ‘Do not make it a ruin, for there is benefit in it,’
So I will act on behalf of My slaves
In order not to make all of them a ruin."
Isaiah,65,9,"“I will bring forth a seed from Jacob,
And a possessor of My mountains from Judah;
Even My chosen ones shall possess it,
And My slaves will dwell there."
Isaiah,65,10,"“Sharon will be a pasture land for flocks,
And the valley of Achor a resting place for herds,
For My people who seek Me."
Isaiah,65,11,"“But you who forsake Yahweh,
Who forget My holy mountain,
Who set a table for Fortune,
And who fill cups with mixed wine for Destiny"
Isaiah,65,12,"I will destine you for the sword,
And all of you will bow down to the slaughter,
Because I called, but you did not answer;
I spoke, but you did not hear.
And you did what was evil in My eyes
And chose that in which I was not pleased.”"
Isaiah,65,13,"Therefore, thus says Lord Yahweh,
“Behold, My slaves will eat, but you will be hungry.
Behold, My slaves will drink, but you will be thirsty.
Behold, My slaves will be glad, but you will be put to shame."
Isaiah,65,14,"“Behold, My slaves will shout joyfully with a merry heart,
But you will cry out with a pained heart,
And you will wail with a broken spirit."
Isaiah,65,15,"“You will leave your name for a curse to My chosen ones,
And Lord Yahweh will put you to death.
But My slaves will be called by another name"
Isaiah,65,16,"Because he who is blessed in the earth
Will be blessed by the God of truth,
And he who swears in the earth
Will swear by the God of truth;
Because the former distresses are forgotten,
And because they are hidden from My sight!"
Isaiah,65,17,"¶“For behold, I am creating a new heavens and a new earth;
And the former things will not be remembered or come upon the heart."
Isaiah,65,18,"“But be joyful and rejoice forever in what I create;
For behold, I create Jerusalem for rejoicing
And her people for joy."
Isaiah,65,19,"“I will also rejoice in Jerusalem and be joyful in My people;
And there will no longer be heard in her
The voice of weeping and the voice of crying."
Isaiah,65,20,"“No longer will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days,
Or an old man who does not fulfill his days;
For the youth will die at the age of one hundred,
And the one who does not reach the age of one hundred
Will be thought accursed."
Isaiah,65,21,"“They will build houses and inhabit them;
They will also plant vineyards and eat their fruit."
Isaiah,65,22,"“They will not build and another inhabit;
They will not plant and another eat;
For as the lifetime of a tree, so will be the days of My people,
And My chosen ones will wear out the work of their hands."
Isaiah,65,23,"“They will not labor in vain,
Or bear children for terror;
For they are the seed of those blessed by Yahweh,
And their offspring with them."
Isaiah,65,24,"And it will be that before they call, I will answer, and while they are still speaking, I will hear."
Isaiah,65,25,"The wolf and the lamb will graze together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox; and dust will be the serpent’s food. They will do no evil nor act corruptly in all My holy mountain,” says Yahweh."
Isaiah,66,1,"Thus says Yahweh,
“Heaven is My throne, and the earth is the footstool of My feet.
Where then is a house you could build for Me?
And where is a place that I may rest?"
Isaiah,66,2,"“For My hand made all these things,
Thus all these things came into being,” declares Yahweh.
“But to this one I will look,
To him who is humble and contrite of spirit, and who trembles at My word."
Isaiah,66,3,"¶“But he who slaughters an ox is the one who strikes down a man;
He who sacrifices a lamb is the one who breaks a dog’s neck;
He who offers a grain offering is the one who offers swine’s blood;
He who offers a memorial offering of frankincense is the one who blesses wickedness.
As they have chosen their own ways,
And their soul takes pleasure in their detestable things"
Isaiah,66,4,"So I will choose their punishments
And will bring on them what they dread,
Because I called, but no one answered;
I spoke, but they did not listen.
And they did what was evil in My eyes
And chose that in which I did not take pleasure.”"
Isaiah,66,5,"Hear the word of Yahweh, you who tremble at His word:
“Your brothers who hate you, who exclude you for My name’s sake,
Have said, ‘Let Yahweh be glorified, that we may see your gladness.’
But they will be put to shame."
Isaiah,66,6,"“A voice of rumbling from the city, a voice from the temple,
The voice of Yahweh who is paying recompense to His enemies."
Isaiah,66,7,"¶“Before she was in labor pains, she gave birth;
Before her pangs came, she delivered a male child."
Isaiah,66,8,"“Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things?
Can a land be brought forth through labor pains in one day?
Can a nation be born all at once?
As soon as Zion was in labor pains, she also gave birth to her sons."
Isaiah,66,9,"“Shall I bring to the point of breaking forth and not cause birth?” says Yahweh.
“Or shall I who causes birth shut the womb?” says your God."
Isaiah,66,10,"“Be glad with Jerusalem and rejoice for her, all you who love her;
Be exceedingly joyful with her, all you who mourn over her"
Isaiah,66,11,"That you may nurse and be satisfied with her comforting breasts,
That you may suck and be delighted with her bountiful bosom.”"
Isaiah,66,12,"For thus says Yahweh, “Behold, I stretch out peace to her like a river,
And the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream;
And you will be nursed; you will be carried on the hip and played with on the knees."
Isaiah,66,13,"“As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you;
And you will be comforted in Jerusalem.”"
Isaiah,66,14,"Then you will see this, and your heart will be joyful,
And your bones will flourish like the new grass;
And the hand of Yahweh will be made known to His slaves,
But He will be indignant toward His enemies."
Isaiah,66,15,"For behold, Yahweh will come in fire
And His chariots like the whirlwind,
To return His anger with wrath,
And His rebuke with flames of fire."
Isaiah,66,16,"For Yahweh will execute judgment by fire
And by His sword on all flesh,
And those slain by Yahweh will be many."
Isaiah,66,17,"“Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go to the gardens,
Following one in the center,
Who eat swine’s flesh, detestable things, and mice,
Will come to an end altogether,” declares Yahweh."
Isaiah,66,18,“And I know their works and their thoughts; the time is coming to gather all nations and tongues. And they shall come and see My glory.
Isaiah,66,19,"I will set a sign among them and will send those who have escaped from them to the nations: Tarshish, Put, Lud, Meshech, Tubal, and Javan, to the distant coastlands that have neither heard My report nor seen My glory. And they will declare My glory among the nations."
Isaiah,66,20,"Then they shall bring all your brothers from all the nations as a grain offering to Yahweh, on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules, and on camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem,” says Yahweh, “just as the sons of Israel bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of Yahweh."
Isaiah,66,21,"I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites,” says Yahweh."
Isaiah,66,22,"“For just as the new heavens and the new earth
Which I make will endure before Me,” declares Yahweh,
“So your seed and your name will endure."
Isaiah,66,23,"“And it shall be from new moon to new moon
And from sabbath to sabbath,
All mankind will come to worship before Me,” says Yahweh."
Isaiah,66,24,"“Then they will go forth and look
On the corpses of the men
Who have transgressed against Me.
For their worm will not die
And their fire will not be quenched;
And they will be an object of contempt to all mankind.”"
