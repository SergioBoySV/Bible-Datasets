And the shepherds’ pasture grounds mourn,
And the top of Carmel dries up.”"
Amos,1,3,"Thus says Yahweh,
“For three transgressions of Damascus and for four

And it will consume the citadels of Ben-hadad."

And cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven
And him who holds the scepter from Beth-eden;
So the people of Aram will go into exile to Kir,”
Says Yahweh."
Amos,1,6,"Thus says Yahweh,
“For three transgressions of Gaza and for four

To deliver it up to Edom."
Amos,1,7,"“So I will send fire upon the wall of Gaza,
And it will consume her citadels."
Amos,1,8,"“I will also cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod
And him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon;
I will even turn My hand against Ekron,
And the remnant of the Philistines will perish,”
Says Lord Yahweh."
Amos,1,9,"Thus says Yahweh,
“For three transgressions of Tyre and for four
I will not turn back its punishment

And did not remember the covenant of brotherhood."
Amos,1,10,"“So I will send fire upon the wall of Tyre,
And it will consume her citadels.”"
Amos,1,11,"Thus says Yahweh,
“For three transgressions of Edom and for four
I will not turn back its punishment
Because he pursued his brother with the sword
While he corrupted his compassion;
And his anger also tore continually,
And he kept his wrath forever."
Amos,1,12,"“So I will send fire upon Teman,
And it will consume the citadels of Bozrah.”"

And it will consume her citadels
Amid a loud shout on the day of battle
And a storm on the day of tempest."

He and his princes together,”

And it will consume the citadels of Kerioth;
And Moab will die amid great rumbling,
Amid a loud shout and the sound of a trumpet."

And kill all her princes with him,” says Yahweh."
Amos,2,4,"Thus says Yahweh,

Their falsehood also has led them astray,
That which their fathers walked after."
Amos,2,5,"“So I will send fire upon Judah,
And it will consume the citadels of Jerusalem.”"
Amos,2,6,"Thus says Yahweh,
“For three transgressions of Israel and for four
I will not turn back its punishment
Because they sell the righteous for money
And the needy for a pair of sandals."
Amos,2,7,"“These who pant after the very dust of the earth on the head of the poor
Also turn aside the way of the humble;
And a man and his father go to the same young woman
In order to profane My holy name."
Amos,2,8,"“On garments taken as pledges they stretch out beside every altar,
And in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined."
Amos,2,9,"¶“Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them,
Though his height was like the height of cedars,
And he was strong as the oaks;
I even destroyed his fruit above and his root below."
Amos,2,10,"“And it was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt,
And I led you in the wilderness forty years
That you might take possession of the land of the Amorite."
Amos,2,11,"“Then I raised up some of your sons to be prophets
And some of your choice men to be Nazirites.
Is this not so, O sons of Israel?” declares Yahweh."
Amos,2,12,"“But you made the Nazirites drink wine,
And you commanded the prophets saying, ‘You shall not prophesy!’"
Amos,2,13,"“Behold, I am weighted down beneath you
As a wagon is weighted down when filled with sheaves."

And the strong will not instill his power with courage,
Nor will the mighty man make his life escape."
Amos,2,15,"“He who grasps the bow will not stand his ground,
The swift of foot will not escape,
Nor will he who rides the horse make his life escape."
Amos,2,16,"“Even the most courageous of heart among the mighty men will flee naked in that day,” declares Yahweh."
Amos,3,1,"Hear this word which Yahweh has spoken against you, sons of Israel, against the entire family which He brought up from the land of Egypt, saying"
Amos,3,2,"“You only have I known among all the families of the earth;
Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.”"
Amos,3,3,Do two men walk together unless they have made an appointment?
Amos,3,4,"Does a lion roar in the forest when it has no prey?
Does a young lion give forth its voice from its den unless it has captured something?"
Amos,3,5,"Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground when there is no bait in it?
Does a trap spring up from the earth when it captures nothing at all?"
Amos,3,6,"If a trumpet is blown in a city will not the people tremble?
If a calamity happens in a city has not Yahweh done it?"
Amos,3,7,"Surely Lord Yahweh does nothing
Unless He reveals His secret counsel
To His slaves the prophets."
Amos,3,8,"A lion has roared! Who will not fear?
Lord Yahweh has spoken! Who can but prophesy?"
Amos,3,9,"Make it heard on the citadels in Ashdod and on the citadels in the land of Egypt and say, “Gather yourselves on the mountains of Samaria and see the great confusions within her and the oppressions in her midst."
Amos,3,10,"But they do not know how to do what is right,” declares Yahweh, “these who hoard up violence and devastation in their citadels.”"
Amos,3,11,"Therefore, thus says Lord Yahweh,
“An adversary, even one surrounding the land,
Will pull down your strength from you,
And your citadels will be plundered.”"
Amos,3,12,"Thus says Yahweh,
“Just as the shepherd delivers from the lion’s mouth a couple of legs or a piece of an ear,
So will the sons of Israel inhabiting Samaria be delivered—
With the corner of a bed and the cover of a couch!"
Amos,3,13,"“Hear and testify against the house of Jacob,”
Declares Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts."
Amos,3,14,"“For on the day that I punish Israel’s transgressions,
I will also punish the altars of Bethel;
The horns of the altar will be cut in pieces,
And they will fall to the ground."

The houses of ivory will also perish,
And the great houses will come to an end,”

In Gilgal multiply transgression!
Bring your sacrifices every morning,
Your tithes every three days."

For so you love to do, you sons of Israel,”
Declares Lord Yahweh."
Amos,4,6,"¶“But I gave you also cleanness of teeth in all your cities
And lack of bread in all your places,
Yet you have not returned to Me,” declares Yahweh."
Amos,4,7,"“And I also withheld the rain from you
While there were still three months until harvest.
Then I would send rain on one city,
And on another city I would not send rain;
One portion would be rained on,
While the portion not rained on would dry up."
Amos,4,8,"“So two or three cities would wander around to another city to drink water,
But would not be satisfied;
Yet you have not returned to Me,” declares Yahweh."
Amos,4,9,"“I struck you with scorching wind and mildew;
And the gnawing locust was devouring
Your many gardens and vineyards, fig trees, and olive trees;
Yet you have not returned to Me,” declares Yahweh."
Amos,4,10,"“I sent a pestilence among you after the manner of Egypt;
I killed your choice men by the sword along with your captured horses,
And I made the stench of your camp rise up even in your nostrils;
Yet you have not returned to Me,” declares Yahweh."
Amos,4,11,"“I overthrew you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,
And you were like a firebrand delivered from a blaze;
Yet you have not returned to Me,” declares Yahweh."
Amos,4,12,"“Therefore thus I will do to you, O Israel;
Because I will do this to you,
Prepare to meet your God, O Israel.”"
Amos,4,13,"For behold, He who forms mountains and creates the wind
And declares to man what are His thoughts,
He who makes dawn into gloom
And treads on the high places of the earth,
Yahweh God of hosts is His name."
Amos,5,1,"Hear this word which I take up for you as a funeral lament, O house of Israel"
Amos,5,2,"She has fallen; she will not rise again—
The virgin Israel.
She lies abandoned on her land;
There is none to raise her up."
Amos,5,3,"For thus says Lord Yahweh,
“The city which goes forth one thousand strong
Will have one hundred left,
And the one which goes forth one hundred strong
Will have ten left to the house of Israel.”"
Amos,5,4,"For thus says Yahweh to the house of Israel,
“Seek Me that you may live."
Amos,5,5,"“But do not seek Bethel,
And do not come to Gilgal,
Nor cross over to Beersheba;
For Gilgal will certainly go into exile,
And Bethel will become evil."
Amos,5,6,"“Seek Yahweh that you may live,
Lest He come mightily like a fire, O house of Joseph,
And it will consume with none to quench it for Bethel"
Amos,5,7,"For those who overturn justice into wormwood
And put righteousness down to the earth.”"
Amos,5,8,"¶He who made the Pleiades and Orion
And overturns the shadow of death into morning,
Who also darkens day into night,
Who calls for the waters of the sea
And pours them out on the surface of the earth,
Yahweh is His name."
Amos,5,9,"It is He who flashes forth with devastation upon the strong
So that devastation comes upon the fortification."
Amos,5,10,"¶They hate him who reproves in the gate,
And they abhor him who speaks with integrity."
Amos,5,11,"Therefore because you impose heavy rent on the poor
And take a tribute of grain from them,
Though you have built houses of cut stone,
Yet you will not live in them;
You have planted desirable vineyards, yet you will not drink their wine."
Amos,5,12,"For I know your transgressions are many and your sins are mighty,
You who distress the righteous and take bribes
And turn aside the needy in the gate."
Amos,5,13,"Therefore at such a time the one with insight keeps silent, for it is an evil time."
Amos,5,14,"¶Seek good and not evil, in order that you may live;
And thus may Yahweh God of hosts be with you,
Just as you have said!"
Amos,5,15,"Hate evil, love good,
And set justice at the gate!
Perhaps Yahweh God of hosts
May be gracious to the remnant of Joseph."
Amos,5,16,"Therefore thus says Yahweh God of hosts, the Lord,
“There is wailing in all the plazas,
And in all the streets they say, ‘Alas! Alas!’
They also call the farmer to mourning
And professional weepers to wailing."
Amos,5,17,"“And in all the vineyards there is wailing
Because I will pass through the midst of you,” says Yahweh."
Amos,5,18,"¶Woe, you who are longing for the day of Yahweh,
For what purpose will the day of Yahweh be to you?
It will be darkness and not light"
Amos,5,19,"As when a man flees from a lion
And a bear meets him;
Or he goes home, leans his hand against the wall,
And a snake bites him."
Amos,5,20,"Will not the day of Yahweh be darkness instead of light,
Even thick darkness with no brightness in it?"
Amos,5,21,"¶“I hate, I reject your feasts,
Nor do I delight in your solemn assemblies."
Amos,5,22,"“Even though you offer up to Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings,
I will not accept them;
And I will not even look at the peace offerings of your fatlings."
Amos,5,23,"“Remove from Me the tumult of your songs;
I will not even listen to the melody of your harps."
Amos,5,24,"“But let justice roll down like waters
And righteousness like an ever-flowing stream."
Amos,5,25,"“Did you present Me with sacrifices and grain offerings in the wilderness for forty years, O house of Israel?"
Amos,5,26,"You also carried along Sikkuth your king and Kiyyun, your images, the star of your gods which you made for yourselves."
Amos,5,27,"Therefore, I will make you go into exile beyond Damascus,” says Yahweh, whose name is the God of hosts."
Amos,6,1,"Woe to those who are at ease in Zion
And to those who feel secure in the mountain of Samaria,
The distinguished men of the first of the nations,
To whom the house of Israel comes."
Amos,6,2,"Pass on over to Calneh and look,
And go from there to Hamath the great,
Then go down to Gath of the Philistines.
Are they better than these kingdoms,
Or are their borders greater than your borders?"
Amos,6,3,"Do you put off the day of calamity,
And would you cause the seat of violence to approach?"
Amos,6,4,"¶Those who lay down on beds of ivory
And sprawl on their couches
And eat lambs from the flock
And calves from the midst of the stall"
Amos,6,5,"Who improvise to the sound of the harp,
And like David have composed songs for themselves"
Amos,6,6,"Who drink wine from sacrificial bowls
While they anoint themselves with the first pick of the oils,
Yet they have not grieved over the destruction of Joseph."
Amos,6,7,"Therefore, they will now go into exile among the first of the exiles,
And the sprawlers’ banqueting will turn aside."
Amos,6,8,"¶Lord Yahweh has sworn by Himself, Yahweh God of hosts has declared:
“I abhor the lofty pride of Jacob
And hate his citadels;
Therefore I will deliver up the city as well as its fullness.”"
Amos,6,9,"And it will be, if ten men are left in one house, they will die."
Amos,6,10,"Then one’s uncle, or the one who burns his bones, will lift him up to bring out his bones from the house, and he will say to the one who is in the innermost part of the house, “Is anyone else with you?” And that one will say, “No one.” Then he will answer, “Keep quiet. For the name of Yahweh is not to be mentioned.”"
Amos,6,11,"For behold, Yahweh is going to command and will strike the great house to pieces and the small house to fragments."
Amos,6,12,"¶Do horses run on rocks?
Or does one plow them with oxen?
Yet you have overturned justice into gall
And the fruit of righteousness into wormwood"
Amos,6,13,"You who are glad in Lo-debar
And say, “Have we not by our own strength taken Karnaim for ourselves?”"
Amos,6,14,"“For behold, I am going to raise up a nation against you,
O house of Israel,” declares Yahweh God of hosts,
“And they will press down on you from Lebo-hamath
To the brook of the Arabah.”"
Amos,7,1,"Thus Lord Yahweh showed me, and behold, He was forming a locust-swarm when the spring crop began to come up. And behold, the spring crop was after the king’s mowing."
Amos,7,2,"And it happened when it had completed eating the vegetation of the land, that I said,
“Lord Yahweh, please pardon!
How can Jacob rise up,
For he is small?”"
Amos,7,3,"Yahweh relented concerning this.
“It shall not be,” said Yahweh."
Amos,7,4,"Thus Lord Yahweh showed me, and behold, Lord Yahweh was calling to contend with them by fire, and it consumed the great deep and began to consume the farm land."
Amos,7,5,"Then I said,
“Lord Yahweh, please stop!
How can Jacob rise up, for he is small?”"
Amos,7,6,"Yahweh relented concerning this.
“This too shall not be,” said Lord Yahweh."
Amos,7,7,"Thus He showed me, and behold, the Lord was standing by a wall made with a plumb line, and in His hand was a plumb line."
Amos,7,8,"And Yahweh said to me, “What do you see, Amos?” And I said, “A plumb line.” Then the Lord said,
“Behold, I am about to put a plumb line
In the midst of My people Israel.
I will pass over them no longer."
Amos,7,9,"“The high places of Isaac will be desolated
And the sanctuaries of Israel laid waste.
Then I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.”"
Amos,7,10,"Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent word to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is unable to endure all his words."
Amos,7,11,"For thus Amos says, ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will certainly go from its land into exile.’ ”"
Amos,7,12,"Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Go, you seer, flee away to the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and there do your prophesying!"
Amos,7,13,"But no longer prophesy at Bethel, for it is a sanctuary of the king and a royal house.”"
Amos,7,14,"Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah, “I am not a prophet, nor am I the son of a prophet; for I am a herdsman and a grower of sycamore figs."
Amos,7,15,"But Yahweh took me from following the flock, and Yahweh said to me, ‘Go prophesy to My people Israel.’"
Amos,7,16,"So now, hear the word of Yahweh: you are saying, ‘You shall not prophesy against Israel, nor shall you drip out words against the house of Isaac.’"
Amos,7,17,"Therefore, thus says Yahweh, ‘Your wife will play the harlot in the city, your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword, your land will be divided up by a measuring line, and you yourself will die upon unclean land. Moreover, Israel will certainly go from its land into exile.’ ”"
Amos,8,1,"Thus Lord Yahweh showed me, and behold, there was a basket of summer fruit."
Amos,8,2,"And he said, “What do you see, Amos?” And I said, “A basket of summer fruit.” Then Yahweh said to me, “The end has come for My people Israel. I will pass over them no longer."
Amos,8,3,"And they will wail with the songs of the palace in that day,” declares Lord Yahweh. “Many will be the corpses; in every place they will cast them forth in silence.”"
Amos,8,4,"Hear this, you who trample the needy, even to cause the humble of the land to cease"
Amos,8,5,"saying,
“When will the new moon pass over,
So that we may sell grain,
And the sabbath, that we may open the wheat market,
To make the bushel smaller and the shekel bigger,
And to cheat with a deceptive balance"
Amos,8,6,"So as to buy the poor for money
And the needy for a pair of sandals,
And that we may sell the refuse of the wheat?”"
Amos,8,7,"¶Yahweh has sworn by the lofty pride of Jacob,
“Indeed, I will never forget any of their works."
Amos,8,8,"“Because of this will not the land tremble
And everyone who inhabits it mourn?
Indeed, all of it will rise up like the Nile,
And it will be tossed about
And subside like the Nile of Egypt."
Amos,8,9,"“And it will be in that day,” declares Lord Yahweh,
“That I will make the sun go down at noon
And make the earth dark in broad daylight."
Amos,8,10,"“Then I will overturn your feasts into mourning
And all your songs into lamentation;
And I will bring up sackcloth on everyone’s loins
And baldness on every head.
And I will make it like a time of mourning for an only son,
And the end of it will be like a bitter day."
Amos,8,11,"¶“Behold, days are coming,” declares Lord Yahweh,
“When I will send a famine on the land,
Not a famine for bread or a thirst for water,
But rather for hearing the words of Yahweh."
Amos,8,12,"“People will wander from sea to sea
And from the north even to the east;
They will go to and fro to seek the word of Yahweh,
But they will not find it."
Amos,8,13,"“In that day the beautiful virgins
And the choice men will faint from thirst."
Amos,8,14,"“As for those who swear by the guilt of Samaria,
Who say, ‘As your god lives, O Dan,’
And, ‘As the way of Beersheba lives,’
They will fall and not rise again.”"
Amos,9,1,"I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and He said,
“Strike the capitals so that the thresholds will quake,
And break them on the heads of them all!
Then I will kill the rest of them with the sword;
Not one of them who can flee will flee,
And not one of them who can survive will escape."
Amos,9,2,"“Though they dig into Sheol,
From there will My hand take them;
And though they ascend to heaven,
From there will I bring them down."
Amos,9,3,"“And though they hide on the top of Carmel,
From there I will search them out and take them;
And though they conceal themselves from My eyes on the floor of the sea,
From there I will command the serpent, and it will bite them."
Amos,9,4,"“And though they go into captivity before their enemies,
From there I will command the sword that it kill them,
And I will set My eyes against them for evil and not for good.”"
Amos,9,5,"¶Now Lord Yahweh of hosts,
The One who touches the land so that it melts,
And all those who inhabit it mourn,
And all of it rises up like the Nile
And subsides like the Nile of Egypt"
Amos,9,6,"The One who builds His upper chambers in the heavens
And has founded His vaulted dome over the earth;
The One who calls for the waters of the sea
And pours them out on the face of the earth;
Yahweh is His name."
Amos,9,7,"¶“Are you not as the sons of Ethiopia to Me,
O sons of Israel?” declares Yahweh.
“Have I not brought up Israel from the land of Egypt,
And the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir?"
Amos,9,8,"“Behold, the eyes of Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom,
And I will destroy it from the face of the earth;
Nevertheless, I will not totally destroy the house of Jacob,”
Declares Yahweh."
Amos,9,9,"“For behold, I am commanding,
And I will shake the house of Israel among all nations
As grain is shaken in a sieve,
But not a kernel will fall to the ground."
Amos,9,10,"“All the sinners of My people will die by the sword,
Those who say, ‘The calamity will not overtake or confront us.’"
Amos,9,11,"¶“In that day I will raise up the fallen booth of David
And wall up its breaches;
I will also raise up its ruins
And rebuild it as in the ancient days"
Amos,9,12,"That they may possess the remnant of Edom
And all the nations who are called by My name,”
Declares Yahweh who does this."
Amos,9,13,"¶“Behold, days are coming,” declares Yahweh,
“When the plowman will overtake the reaper
And the treader of grapes him who sows seed;
When the mountains will drip sweet wine
And all the hills will melt."
Amos,9,14,"“Also I will restore the captivity of My people Israel,
And they will rebuild the desolated cities and live in them;
They will also plant vineyards and drink their wine
And make gardens and eat their fruit."
Amos,9,15,"“I will also plant them on their land,
And they will not again be uprooted from their land
Which I have given them,”
Says Yahweh your God."
