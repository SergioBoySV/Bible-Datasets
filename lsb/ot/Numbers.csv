Numbers,1,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying"
Numbers,1,2,"“Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, every male, head by head"
Numbers,1,3,"from twenty years old and upward, whoever is able to go out to war in Israel, you and Aaron shall number them by their armies."
Numbers,1,4,"With you, moreover, there shall be a man of each tribe, each one head of his father’s household."
Numbers,1,5,"These then are the names of the men who shall stand with you:
of Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur"
Numbers,1,6,"of Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai"
Numbers,1,7,"of Judah, Nahshon the son of Amminadab"
Numbers,1,8,"of Issachar, Nethanel the son of Zuar"
Numbers,1,9,"of Zebulun, Eliab the son of Helon"

Numbers,1,14,"of Gad, Eliasaph the son of Deuel"
Numbers,1,15,"of Naphtali, Ahira the son of Enan."
Numbers,1,16,"These are they who were called upon by the congregation, the leaders of their fathers’ tribes; they were the heads of divisions of Israel.”"
Numbers,1,17,So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name
Numbers,1,18,"and they assembled all the congregation together on the first of the second month. Then they registered by genealogy in their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, head by head"
Numbers,1,19,just as Yahweh had commanded Moses. So he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers,1,20,"Now the sons of Reuben, Israel’s firstborn, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war"
Numbers,1,21,"their numbered men of the tribe of Reuben were 46,500."

Numbers,1,29,"their numbered men of the tribe of Issachar were 54,400."
Numbers,1,30,"Of the sons of Zebulun, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war"
Numbers,1,31,"their numbered men of the tribe of Zebulun were 57,400."
Numbers,1,32,"Of the sons of Joseph, namely, of the sons of Ephraim, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war"
Numbers,1,33,"their numbered men of the tribe of Ephraim were 40,500."

Numbers,1,39,"their numbered men of the tribe of Dan were 62,700."
Numbers,1,40,"Of the sons of Asher, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war"
Numbers,1,41,"their numbered men of the tribe of Asher were 41,500."
Numbers,1,42,"Of the sons of Naphtali, their genealogical registration by their families, by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war"
Numbers,1,43,"their numbered men of the tribe of Naphtali were 53,400."
Numbers,1,44,"These are the ones who were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, with the leaders of Israel, twelve men, each of whom was of his father’s household."
Numbers,1,45,"So all the numbered men of the sons of Israel by their fathers’ households, from twenty years old and upward, whoever was able to go out to war in Israel"
Numbers,1,46,"even all the numbered men were 603,550."
Numbers,1,47,"The Levites, however, were not numbered among them by their fathers’ tribe."
Numbers,1,48,"Yahweh had spoken to Moses, saying"
Numbers,1,49,"“Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, nor shall you take their census among the sons of Israel."
Numbers,1,50,"But you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony and over all its furnishings and over all that belongs to it. They shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings, and they shall attend to it; they shall also camp around the tabernacle."
Numbers,1,51,"So when the tabernacle is to set out, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle encamps, the Levites shall set it up. But the layman who comes near shall be put to death."
Numbers,1,52,"And the sons of Israel shall camp, each man by his own camp, and each man by his own standard, according to their armies."
Numbers,1,53,But the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the testimony so that there will be no wrath on the congregation of the sons of Israel. So the Levites shall keep charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.”
Numbers,1,54,"Thus the sons of Israel did; according to all which Yahweh had commanded Moses, so they did."
Numbers,2,1,"Now Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying"
Numbers,2,2,"“The sons of Israel shall camp, each by his own standard, with the banners of their fathers’ households; they shall camp around the tent of meeting at a distance."
Numbers,2,3,"Now those who camp on the east side toward the sunrise shall be of the standard of the camp of Judah, by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Judah: Nahshon the son of Amminadab"
Numbers,2,4,"and his army, even their numbered men, 74,600."
Numbers,2,5,"Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar, and the leader of the sons of Issachar: Nethanel the son of Zuar"
Numbers,2,6,"and his army, even his numbered men, 54,400."
Numbers,2,7,"Then the tribe of Zebulun, and the leader of the sons of Zebulun: Eliab the son of Helon"
Numbers,2,8,"and his army, even his numbered men, 57,400."
Numbers,2,9,"The total of the numbered men of the camp of Judah: 186,400, by their armies. They shall set out first."
Numbers,2,10,"“On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Reuben: Elizur the son of Shedeur"
Numbers,2,11,"and his army, even his numbered men, 46,500."
Numbers,2,12,"And those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon, and the leader of the sons of Simeon: Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai"
Numbers,2,13,"and his army, even their numbered men, 59,300."
Numbers,2,14,"Then the tribe of Gad, and the leader of the sons of Gad: Eliasaph the son of Deuel"
Numbers,2,15,"and his army, even their numbered men, 45,650."
Numbers,2,16,"The total of the numbered men of the camp of Reuben: 151,450 by their armies. And they shall set out second."
Numbers,2,17,"“Then the tent of meeting shall set out with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps; just as they camp, so they shall set out, every man in his place by their standards."
Numbers,2,18,"“On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Ephraim: Elishama the son of Ammihud"
Numbers,2,19,"and his army, even their numbered men, 40,500."
Numbers,2,20,"Next to him shall be the tribe of Manasseh, and the leader of the sons of Manasseh: Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur"
Numbers,2,21,"and his army, even their numbered men, 32,200."
Numbers,2,22,"Then the tribe of Benjamin, and the leader of the sons of Benjamin: Abidan the son of Gideoni"
Numbers,2,23,"and his army, even their numbered men, 35,400."
Numbers,2,24,"The total of the numbered men of the camp of Ephraim: 108,100, by their armies. And they shall set out third."

Numbers,2,26,"and his army, even their numbered men, 62,700."
Numbers,2,27,"Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher, and the leader of the sons of Asher: Pagiel the son of Ochran"
Numbers,2,28,"and his army, even their numbered men, 41,500."
Numbers,2,29,"Then the tribe of Naphtali, and the leader of the sons of Naphtali: Ahira the son of Enan"
Numbers,2,30,"and his army, even their numbered men, 53,400."
Numbers,2,31,"The total of the numbered men of the camp of Dan was 157,600. They shall set out last by their standards.”"
Numbers,2,32,"These are the numbered men of the sons of Israel by their fathers’ households; the total of the numbered men of the camps by their armies, 603,550."
Numbers,2,33,"The Levites, however, were not numbered among the sons of Israel, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses."
Numbers,2,34,"Thus the sons of Israel did; according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so they camped by their standards, and so they set out, every one by his family according to his father’s household."
Numbers,3,1,Now these are the generations of Aaron and Moses at the time when Yahweh spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
Numbers,3,2,"These then are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar."
Numbers,3,3,"These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he ordained to minister as priests."
Numbers,3,4,But Nadab and Abihu died before Yahweh when they offered strange fire before Yahweh in the wilderness of Sinai; and they had no children. So Eleazar and Ithamar ministered as priests in the lifetime of their father Aaron.
Numbers,3,5,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,3,6,"“Bring the tribe of Levi near and have them stand before Aaron the priest, that they may minister to him."
Numbers,3,7,"And they shall keep his responsibility and the responsibility for the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to perform the service of the tabernacle."
Numbers,3,8,"They shall also keep all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, along with the responsibility of the sons of Israel, to perform the service of the tabernacle."
Numbers,3,9,You shall thus give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons; they are wholly given to him from among the sons of Israel.
Numbers,3,10,"So you shall appoint Aaron and his sons that they may keep their priesthood, but the outsider who comes near shall be put to death.”"
Numbers,3,11,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,3,12,"“Now, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the sons of Israel instead of every firstborn, the first offspring of the womb among the sons of Israel. So the Levites shall be Mine."
Numbers,3,13,"For all the firstborn are Mine; on the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified to Myself all the firstborn in Israel, from man to beast. They shall be Mine; I am Yahweh.”"
Numbers,3,14,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying"
Numbers,3,15,"“Number the sons of Levi by their fathers’ households, by their families; every male from a month old and upward you shall number.”"
Numbers,3,16,"So Moses numbered them according to the word of Yahweh, just as he had been commanded."
Numbers,3,17,"These then are the sons of Levi by their names:
Gershon and Kohath and Merari."
Numbers,3,18,"And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families:
Libni and Shimei"
Numbers,3,19,"and the sons of Kohath by their families:
Amram and Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel"
Numbers,3,20,"and the sons of Merari by their families:
Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their fathers’ households."
Numbers,3,21,Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimeites; these were the families of the Gershonites.
Numbers,3,22,"Their numbered men, in the numbering of every male from a month old and upward, even their numbered men were 7,500."
Numbers,3,23,The families of the Gershonites were to camp behind the tabernacle westward
Numbers,3,24,and the leader of the fathers’ households of the Gershonites was Eliasaph the son of Lael.
Numbers,3,25,"Now the responsibility of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting involved the tabernacle and the tent, its covering, and the screen for the doorway of the tent of meeting"
Numbers,3,26,"and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the doorway of the court which is around the tabernacle and the altar, and its cords, according to all the service concerning them."
Numbers,3,27,Of Kohath was the family of the Amramites and the family of the Izharites and the family of the Hebronites and the family of the Uzzielites; these were the families of the Kohathites.
Numbers,3,28,"In the numbering of every male from a month old and upward, there were 8,600, keeping the responsibility of the sanctuary."
Numbers,3,29,The families of the sons of Kohath were to camp on the southward side of the tabernacle
Numbers,3,30,and the leader of the fathers’ households of the Kohathite families was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.
Numbers,3,31,"Now their responsibility involved the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, and the utensils of the sanctuary with which they minister, and the screen, and all the service concerning them"
Numbers,3,32,and Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest was the chief of the leaders of Levi and had the oversight of those who keep the responsibility of the sanctuary.
Numbers,3,33,Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites and the family of the Mushites; these were the families of Merari.
Numbers,3,34,"And their numbered men, in the numbering of every male from a month old and upward, were 6,200."
Numbers,3,35,And the leader of the fathers’ households of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail. They were to camp on the northward side of the tabernacle.
Numbers,3,36,"Now the appointed responsibility of the sons of Merari involved the boards of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its bases, all its equipment, and the service concerning them"
Numbers,3,37,and the pillars around the court with their bases and their pegs and their cords.
Numbers,3,38,"Now those who were to camp before the tabernacle eastward, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, are Moses and Aaron and his sons, keeping the responsibility of the sanctuary for the responsibility of the sons of Israel; but the outsider coming near was to be put to death."
Numbers,3,39,"All the numbered men of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the command of Yahweh by their families, every male from a month old and upward, were 22,000."
Numbers,3,40,"Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Number every firstborn male of the sons of Israel from a month old and upward, and make a list of their names."
Numbers,3,41,"And you shall take the Levites for Me, I am Yahweh, instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the sons of Israel.”"
Numbers,3,42,"So Moses numbered all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, just as Yahweh had commanded him"
Numbers,3,43,"and all the firstborn males by the number of names from a month old and upward, for their numbered men were 22,273."
Numbers,3,44,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,3,45,“Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel and the cattle of the Levites. And the Levites shall be Mine; I am Yahweh.
Numbers,3,46,For the redemption price of the 273 of the firstborn of the sons of Israel who are in excess beyond the Levites
Numbers,3,47,"you shall take five shekels apiece, per head; you shall take them in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs)"
Numbers,3,48,"and give the money, the redemption price of those who are in excess among them, to Aaron and to his sons.”"
Numbers,3,49,"So Moses took the money of the redemption price from those who were in excess, beyond those redeemed by the Levites"
Numbers,3,50,"from the firstborn of the sons of Israel he took the money in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary, 1,365."
Numbers,3,51,"Then Moses gave the money of the redemption price to Aaron and to his sons, at the command of Yahweh, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses."
Numbers,4,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying"
Numbers,4,2,"“Take a census of the descendants of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers’ households"
Numbers,4,3,"from thirty years and upward, even to fifty years old, all who enter the duty of doing the work in the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,4,"This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting, concerning the most holy things."
Numbers,4,5,"“And when the camp sets out, Aaron and his sons shall go in and they shall take down the veil of the screen and cover the ark of the testimony with it"
Numbers,4,6,and they shall put a covering of porpoise skin on it and shall spread over it a cloth of pure blue and shall insert its poles.
Numbers,4,7,"Over the table of the bread of the Presence they shall also spread a cloth of blue and put on it the dishes and the pans and the offering bowls and the jars for the drink offering, and the continual bread shall be on it."
Numbers,4,8,"And they shall spread over them a cloth of scarlet material and cover the same with a covering of porpoise skin, and they shall insert its poles."
Numbers,4,9,"Then they shall take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand for the light, along with its lamps and its tongs, and its trays and all its oil vessels, by which they minister in connection to it"
Numbers,4,10,and they shall put it and all its utensils in a covering of porpoise skin and shall put it on the carrying bars.
Numbers,4,11,And over the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth and cover it with a covering of porpoise skin and shall insert its poles
Numbers,4,12,"and they shall take all the utensils of ministry, with which they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a blue cloth and cover them with a covering of porpoise skin and put them on the carrying bars."
Numbers,4,13,Then they shall take away the ashes from the altar and spread a purple cloth over it.
Numbers,4,14,"They shall also put on it all its utensils by which they minister in connection with it: the firepans, the flesh hooks and shovels and the bowls, all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread a cover of porpoise skin over it and insert its poles."
Numbers,4,15,"When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy objects and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, when the camp is to set out, after that the sons of Kohath shall come to carry them, so that they will not touch the holy objects and die. These are the things in the tent of meeting which the sons of Kohath are to carry."
Numbers,4,16,"“And the assignment of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest is the oil for the light and the fragrant incense and the continual grain offering and the anointing oil—the assignment of all the tabernacle and of all that is in it, with the sanctuary and its furnishings.”"
Numbers,4,17,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying"
Numbers,4,18,“Do not let the tribe of the families of the Kohathites be cut off from among the Levites.
Numbers,4,19,But do this to them that they may live and not die when they approach the most holy objects: Aaron and his sons shall go in and set each of them to his service and to his load
Numbers,4,20,"but they shall not go in to see the holy objects even for a moment, or they will die.”"
Numbers,4,21,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,4,22,"“Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers’ households, by their families"
Numbers,4,23,"from thirty years and upward to fifty years old, you shall number them; all who enter to perform the duty of performing the service in the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,24,"This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and in carrying"
Numbers,4,25,"they shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle and the tent of meeting with its covering and the covering of porpoise skin that is on top of it, and the screen for the doorway of the tent of meeting"
Numbers,4,26,"and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the doorway of the gate of the court which is around the tabernacle and the altar, and their cords and all the equipment for their service; and all that is to be done, they shall perform."
Numbers,4,27,"All the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their loads and in all their service, shall be performed at the command of Aaron and his sons; and you shall assign to them as a responsibility all their loads."
Numbers,4,28,"This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting, and their responsibilities shall be under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest."
Numbers,4,29,"“As for the sons of Merari, you shall number them by their families, by their fathers’ households"
Numbers,4,30,"from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, you shall number them, everyone who enters the duty of performing the service of the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,31,"Now this is the responsibility of their loads, for all their service in the tent of meeting: the boards of the tabernacle and its bars and its pillars and its bases"
Numbers,4,32,"and the pillars around the court and their bases and their pegs and their cords, with all their equipment and with all their service; and you shall assign each man by name the items of the responsibility of his load."
Numbers,4,33,"This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service in the tent of meeting, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.”"
Numbers,4,34,So Moses and Aaron and the leaders of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families and by their fathers’ households
Numbers,4,35,"from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the duty of service in the tent of meeting."
Numbers,4,36,"Their numbered men by their families were 2,750."
Numbers,4,37,"These are the numbered men of the Kohathite families, everyone who was serving in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Yahweh by the hand of Moses."
Numbers,4,38,The numbered men of the sons of Gershon by their families and by their fathers’ households
Numbers,4,39,"from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the duty of service in the tent of meeting"
Numbers,4,40,"their numbered men by their families, by their fathers’ households, were 2,630."
Numbers,4,41,"These are the numbered men of the families of the sons of Gershon, everyone who was serving in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Yahweh."
Numbers,4,42,"The numbered men of the families of the sons of Merari by their families, by their fathers’ households"
Numbers,4,43,"from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the duty of service in the tent of meeting"
Numbers,4,44,"their numbered men by their families were 3,200."
Numbers,4,45,"These are the numbered men of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Yahweh by the hand of Moses."
Numbers,4,46,"All the numbered men of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the leaders of Israel numbered, by their families and by their fathers’ households"
Numbers,4,47,"from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who could enter to perform the work of service and the service of carrying in the tent of meeting"
Numbers,4,48,"their numbered men were 8,580."
Numbers,4,49,"According to the word of Yahweh by the hand of Moses, they were numbered, everyone by his serving or carrying; thus these were his numbered men, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses."
Numbers,5,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,5,2,“Command the sons of Israel that they send away from the camp every leper and everyone having a discharge and everyone who is unclean because of a dead person.
Numbers,5,3,You shall send away both male and female; you shall send them outside the camp so that they will not defile their camp where I dwell in their midst.”
Numbers,5,4,"And the sons of Israel did so and sent them outside the camp; just as Yahweh had spoken to Moses, thus the sons of Israel did."
Numbers,5,5,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,5,6,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, ‘When a man or woman commits any of the sins of mankind, acting unfaithfully against Yahweh, and that person is guilty"
Numbers,5,7,"then he shall confess his sins which he has committed, and he shall make restitution in full for his wrong and add to it one-fifth of it and give it to him whom he has wronged."
Numbers,5,8,"But if the man has no kinsman redeemer to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution which is made for the wrong must go to Yahweh for the priest, besides the ram of atonement, by which atonement is made for him."
Numbers,5,9,"Also every contribution pertaining to all the holy gifts of the sons of Israel, which they bring near to the priest, shall be his."
Numbers,5,10,"So every man’s holy gifts shall be his; whatever any man gives to the priest, it becomes his.’ ”"
Numbers,5,11,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,5,12,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘If any man’s wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him"
Numbers,5,13,"and a man lies sexually with her, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and she is undetected; but she has defiled herself, and there is no witness against her, and she has not been caught in the act"
Numbers,5,14,"if a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife and she has defiled herself, or if a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife but she has not defiled herself"
Numbers,5,15,"the man shall then bring his wife to the priest and shall bring as an offering for her one-tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall not pour oil on it nor put frankincense on it, for it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of remembrance, a reminder of iniquity."
Numbers,5,16,‘Then the priest shall bring her near and have her stand before Yahweh
Numbers,5,17,and the priest shall take holy water in an earthenware vessel; and the priest shall take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.
Numbers,5,18,"The priest shall then have the woman stand before Yahweh and let the hair of the woman’s head go loose, and he shall place the grain offering of remembrance in her hands, which is the grain offering of jealousy; and in the hand of the priest is to be the water of bitterness that brings curses."
Numbers,5,19,"Then the priest shall have her swear an oath and shall say to the woman, “If no man has lain with you, and if you have not gone astray into defilement, being under the authority of your husband, be free from this water of bitterness that brings curses"
Numbers,5,20,"if you, however, have gone astray, being under the authority of your husband, and if you have defiled yourself, and a man other than your husband has lain with you”"
Numbers,5,21,"(then the priest shall have the woman swear with the oath of the curse, and the priest shall say to the woman), “Yahweh make you a curse and an oath among your people by Yahweh making your thigh fall away and your abdomen swell"
Numbers,5,22,"and this water that brings curses shall go into your stomach and make your abdomen swell and your thigh fall away.” And the woman shall say, “Amen. Amen.”"
Numbers,5,23,"‘The priest shall then write these curses on a scroll, and he shall wash them off into the water of bitterness."
Numbers,5,24,"Then he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings curses, so that the water which brings a curse will go into her to cause bitterness."
Numbers,5,25,"And the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from the woman’s hand, and he shall wave the grain offering before Yahweh and bring it near to the altar"
Numbers,5,26,"and the priest shall take a handful of the grain offering as its memorial offering and offer it up in smoke on the altar, and afterward he shall make the woman drink the water."
Numbers,5,27,"So he will have her drink the water, and it will be that, if she has defiled herself and has been unfaithful to her husband, that the water which brings curses will go into her to cause bitterness, and her abdomen will swell and her thigh will fall away, and the woman will become a curse among her people."
Numbers,5,28,"But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, she will then be free and conceive a seed."
Numbers,5,29,"‘This is the law of jealousy: when a wife, being under the authority of her husband, goes astray and defiles herself"
Numbers,5,30,"or when a spirit of jealousy comes over a man and he is jealous of his wife, he shall then make the woman stand before Yahweh, and the priest shall apply all this law to her."
Numbers,5,31,"Moreover, the man will be free from guilt, but that woman shall bear her guilt.’ ”"
Numbers,6,1,"Again Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,6,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When a man or woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to dedicate himself as a Nazirite to Yahweh"
Numbers,6,3,"he shall abstain as a Nazirite from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar, whether made from wine or strong drink, nor shall he drink any grape juice nor eat fresh or dried grapes."
Numbers,6,4,"All the days of his Nazirite vow he shall not eat anything that is produced by the grape vine, from the seeds even to the skin."
Numbers,6,5,‘All the days of his vow as a Nazirite no razor shall pass over his head. He shall be holy until the days are fulfilled for which he dedicated himself as a Nazirite to Yahweh; he shall let the locks of hair on his head grow long.
Numbers,6,6,‘All the days of his dedication as a Nazirite to Yahweh he shall not go near to a dead person.
Numbers,6,7,"He shall not defile himself for his father or for his mother, for his brother or for his sister, when they die, because the Nazirite vow to his God is on his head."
Numbers,6,8,All the days of his Nazirite vow he is holy to Yahweh.
Numbers,6,9,"‘But if a man dies very suddenly beside him and he defiles the head of hair during his Nazirite vow, then he shall shave his head on the day when he becomes clean; he shall shave it on the seventh day."
Numbers,6,10,"Then on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the doorway of the tent of meeting."
Numbers,6,11,And the priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering and make atonement for him concerning his sin because of the dead person. And that same day he shall set apart his head as holy
Numbers,6,12,and shall dedicate to Yahweh the days of his Nazirite vow and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a guilt offering; but the former days will be void because his Nazirite vow was defiled.
Numbers,6,13,‘Now this is the law of the Nazirite when the days of his Nazirite vow are fulfilled: he shall bring the offering to the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Numbers,6,14,And he shall bring his offering near to Yahweh: one male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering and one ram without blemish for a peace offering
Numbers,6,15,"and a basket of unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil and unleavened wafers spread with oil, along with their grain offering and their drink offering."
Numbers,6,16,Then the priest shall bring them near before Yahweh and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering.
Numbers,6,17,"He shall also offer with the ram a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh, together with the basket of unleavened cakes; the priest shall likewise offer its grain offering and its drink offering."
Numbers,6,18,The Nazirite shall then shave the head of hair for his Nazirite vow at the doorway of the tent of meeting and take the hair of his head of his Nazirite vow and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings.
Numbers,6,19,"And the priest shall take the ram’s shoulder when it has been boiled, and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved the hair of his Nazirite vow."
Numbers,6,20,"Then the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh. It is holy for the priest, together with the breast offered by waving and the thigh offered by raising up; and afterward the Nazirite may drink wine.’"
Numbers,6,21,"“This is the law of the Nazirite who vows his offering to Yahweh according to his Nazirite vow, in addition to what else he can afford; according to his vow which he takes, so he shall do according to the law of his Nazirite vow.”"
Numbers,6,22,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,6,23,"“Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, ‘Thus you shall bless the sons of Israel. You shall say to them"
Numbers,6,24,"¶Yahweh bless you, and keep you"
Numbers,6,25,"¶Yahweh make His face shine on you,
And be gracious to you"
Numbers,6,26,"¶Yahweh lift up His face on you,
And give you peace.’"
Numbers,6,27,"So they shall invoke My name on the sons of Israel, and I then will bless them.”"
Numbers,7,1,"Now it happened on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, that he anointed it and set it apart as holy with all its furnishings and the altar and all its utensils; he anointed them and set them apart as holy."
Numbers,7,2,"Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers’ households, brought an offering near (they were the leaders of the tribes; they were the ones who were over the numbered men)."
Numbers,7,3,"And they brought their offering before Yahweh, six covered carts and twelve oxen, a cart for every two of the leaders and an ox for each one, and they brought them near before the tabernacle."
Numbers,7,4,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,7,5,"“Accept these things from them, that they may be used in the service of the tent of meeting, and you shall give them to the Levites, to each man according to his service.”"
Numbers,7,6,So Moses took the carts and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.
Numbers,7,7,"Two carts and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service"
Numbers,7,8,"and four carts and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest."
Numbers,7,9,"But he did not give any to the sons of Kohath because theirs was the service of the holy objects, which they carried on the shoulder."
Numbers,7,10,"And the leaders brought near the dedication offering for the altar when it was anointed, so the leaders brought their offering near before the altar."
Numbers,7,11,"Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Let them bring their offering near, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar.”"
Numbers,7,12,"Now the one who brought his offering near on the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah"
Numbers,7,13,"and his offering was one silver dish whose weight was 130 shekels, one silver bowl of 70 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering"

Numbers,7,89,"Now when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with Him, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim, so He spoke to him."
Numbers,8,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,8,2,"“Speak to Aaron and say to him, ‘When you mount the lamps, the seven lamps will give light in the front of the lampstand.’ ”"
Numbers,8,3,"Aaron therefore did so; he mounted its lamps at the front of the lampstand, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses."
Numbers,8,4,"Now this was the workmanship of the lampstand, hammered work of gold; from its base to its flowers it was hammered work; according to the pattern which Yahweh had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand."
Numbers,8,5,"Again Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,8,6,“Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel and cleanse them.
Numbers,8,7,"Thus you shall do to them, for their cleansing: sprinkle purifying water on them, and let them use a razor over their whole body and wash their clothes, and they will be clean."
Numbers,8,8,"Then let them take a bull from the herd with its grain offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and a second bull from the herd you shall take for a sin offering."
Numbers,8,9,So you shall bring the Levites near before the tent of meeting. You shall also assemble the whole congregation of the sons of Israel
Numbers,8,10,and bring the Levites near before Yahweh; and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites.
Numbers,8,11,"Aaron then shall present the Levites before Yahweh as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, that they may be qualified to perform the service of Yahweh."
Numbers,8,12,"Now the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls; then offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to Yahweh, to make atonement for the Levites."
Numbers,8,13,And you shall have the Levites stand before Aaron and before his sons so as to present them as a wave offering to Yahweh.
Numbers,8,14,"“Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and the Levites shall be Mine."
Numbers,8,15,Then after that the Levites may go in to serve the tent of meeting. But you shall cleanse them and present them as a wave offering
Numbers,8,16,"for they are wholly given to Me from among the sons of Israel. I have taken them for Myself instead of every first issue of the womb, the firstborn of all the sons of Israel."
Numbers,8,17,"For every firstborn among the sons of Israel is Mine, among the men and among the animals; on the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for Myself."
Numbers,8,18,But I have taken the Levites instead of every firstborn among the sons of Israel.
Numbers,8,19,"And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the sons of Israel, to perform the service of the sons of Israel at the tent of meeting and to make atonement on behalf of the sons of Israel, so that there will be no plague among the sons of Israel by their coming near to the sanctuary.”"
Numbers,8,20,"Thus did Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the sons of Israel to the Levites; according to all that Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the sons of Israel did to them."
Numbers,8,21,"The Levites, too, purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes; and Aaron presented them as a wave offering before Yahweh. Aaron also made atonement for them to cleanse them."
Numbers,8,22,"Then after that the Levites went in to perform their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and before his sons; just as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them."
Numbers,8,23,"Now Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,8,24,“This is what applies to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall enter to perform their duty in the service of the tent of meeting.
Numbers,8,25,But at the age of fifty years they shall retire from their duty in the service and not serve anymore.
Numbers,8,26,"They may, however, minister to their brothers in the tent of meeting in order to keep up their responsibility, but they themselves shall perform no service. Thus you shall deal with the Levites concerning their responsibilities.”"
Numbers,9,1,"Thus Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying"
Numbers,9,2,"“Now, let the sons of Israel observe the Passover at its appointed time."
Numbers,9,3,"On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall observe it at its appointed time; you shall observe it according to all its statutes and according to all its judgments.”"
Numbers,9,4,So Moses told the sons of Israel to celebrate the Passover.
Numbers,9,5,"And they celebrated the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that Yahweh had commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did."
Numbers,9,6,"But there were some men who were unclean because of a dead person, so that they could not celebrate Passover on that day; so they came near before Moses and Aaron on that day."
Numbers,9,7,"And those men said to him, “We are unclean because of a dead person. But why are we restrained from bringing near the offering of Yahweh at its appointed time among the sons of Israel?”"
Numbers,9,8,"Moses therefore said to them, “Wait, and I will listen to what Yahweh will command concerning you.”"
Numbers,9,9,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,9,10,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘If any one of you or of your generations becomes unclean because of a dead person, or is on a distant journey, he may, however, celebrate the Passover to Yahweh."
Numbers,9,11,"In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight, they shall observe it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs."
Numbers,9,12,They shall leave none of it until morning nor break a bone of it; according to all the statute of the Passover they shall celebrate it.
Numbers,9,13,"But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, and yet neglects to celebrate the Passover, that person shall then be cut off from his people, for he did not bring near the offering of Yahweh at its appointed time. That man will bear his sin."
Numbers,9,14,"If a sojourner sojourns among you and celebrates the Passover to Yahweh, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its judgment, so he shall do; you shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native of the land.’ ”"
Numbers,9,15,"Now on the day that the tabernacle was erected the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony, and in the evening it was like the appearance of fire over the tabernacle until morning."
Numbers,9,16,"So it was continuously; the cloud would cover it by day, and the appearance of fire by night."
Numbers,9,17,"Now whenever the cloud would go up from over the tent, afterward the sons of Israel would then set out; and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the sons of Israel would camp."
Numbers,9,18,"At the command of Yahweh the sons of Israel would set out, and at the command of Yahweh they would camp; as long as the cloud settled over the tabernacle, they remained camped."
Numbers,9,19,"Even when the cloud lingered over the tabernacle for many days, the sons of Israel would keep the charge of Yahweh and not set out."
Numbers,9,20,"If sometimes the cloud remained a few days over the tabernacle, according to the command of Yahweh they remained camped. Then according to the command of Yahweh they set out."
Numbers,9,21,"If sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning, when the cloud was lifted in the morning, they would move out; or if it remained in the daytime and at night, whenever the cloud was lifted, they would set out."
Numbers,9,22,"Whether it was two days or a month or a year that the cloud lingered over the tabernacle, dwelling above it, the sons of Israel remained camped and did not set out; but when it was lifted, they did set out."
Numbers,9,23,"At the command of Yahweh they camped, and at the command of Yahweh they set out; they kept the charge of Yahweh, according to the command of Yahweh by the hand of Moses."
Numbers,10,1,"Yahweh spoke further to Moses, saying"
Numbers,10,2,"“Make yourself two trumpets of silver, of hammered work you shall make them; and you shall use them for summoning the congregation and for having the camps set out."
Numbers,10,3,"So both will be blown, and all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the doorway of the tent of meeting."
Numbers,10,4,"Yet if only one is blown, then the leaders, the heads of the divisions of Israel, shall assemble before you."
Numbers,10,5,"But when you blow an alarm, the camps that are pitched on the east side shall set out."
Numbers,10,6,"Then you will blow an alarm the second time, and the camps that are pitched on the south side shall set out; an alarm is to be blown for them to set out."
Numbers,10,7,"When convening the assembly, however, you shall blow without sounding an alarm."
Numbers,10,8,"The priestly sons of Aaron, moreover, shall blow the trumpets; and this shall be for you a perpetual statute throughout your generations."
Numbers,10,9,"Now when you go to war in your land against the adversary who attacks you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, that you may be remembered before Yahweh your God and be saved from your enemies."
Numbers,10,10,"Also in the day of your gladness and in your appointed feasts, and on the first days of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be as a remembrance of you before your God. I am Yahweh your God.”"
Numbers,10,11,"Now it happened in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth of the month, that the cloud was lifted from over the tabernacle of the testimony"
Numbers,10,12,and the sons of Israel set out on their journeys from the wilderness of Sinai. Then the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran.
Numbers,10,13,So they moved out for the first time according to the command of Yahweh by the hand of Moses.
Numbers,10,14,"And the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah, according to their armies, set out first, with Nahshon the son of Amminadab, over its army"
Numbers,10,15,"and Nethanel the son of Zuar, over the tribal army of the sons of Issachar"
Numbers,10,16,and Eliab the son of Helon over the tribal army of the sons of Zebulun.
Numbers,10,17,"Then the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who were carrying the tabernacle, set out."
Numbers,10,18,"Next the standard of the camp of Reuben, according to their armies, set out with Elizur the son of Shedeur, over its army"
Numbers,10,19,and Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai over the tribal army of the sons of Simeon
Numbers,10,20,and Eliasaph the son of Deuel over the tribal army of the sons of Gad.
Numbers,10,21,"Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy objects; and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival."
Numbers,10,22,"Next the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim, according to their armies, set out, with Elishama the son of Ammihud over its army"
Numbers,10,23,and Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur over the tribal army of the sons of Manasseh
Numbers,10,24,and Abidan the son of Gideoni over the tribal army of the sons of Benjamin.
Numbers,10,25,"Then the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan, according to their armies, which formed the rear guard for all the camps, set out, with Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai over its army"
Numbers,10,26,and Pagiel the son of Ochran over the tribal army of the sons of Asher
Numbers,10,27,and Ahira the son of Enan over the tribal army of the sons of Naphtali.
Numbers,10,28,This was the order of march of the sons of Israel by their armies as they set out.
Numbers,10,29,"Then Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out to the place of which Yahweh said, ‘I will give it to you’; come with us and we will do you good, for Yahweh has promised good concerning Israel.”"
Numbers,10,30,"But he said to him, “I will not come, but rather will go to my own land and kin.”"
Numbers,10,31,"Then he said, “Please do not leave us, inasmuch as you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will be as eyes for us."
Numbers,10,32,"So it will be, if you go with us, that whatever good Yahweh does for us, we will do for you.”"
Numbers,10,33,"Thus they set out from the mount of Yahweh three days’ journey, with the ark of the covenant of Yahweh journeying in front of them for the three days, to spy out a resting place for them."
Numbers,10,34,Now the cloud of Yahweh was over them by day when they set out from the camp.
Numbers,10,35,"Then it happened when the ark set out that Moses said,
“Rise up, O Yahweh!
And let Your enemies be scattered,
And let those who hate You flee before You.”"
Numbers,10,36,"And when it came to rest, he said,
“Return, O Yahweh,
To the myriad thousands of Israel.”"
Numbers,11,1,"Now the people became like those who complain of calamity in the ears of Yahweh. And Yahweh heard it and His anger was kindled, and the fire of Yahweh burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp."
Numbers,11,2,"The people therefore cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire died out."
Numbers,11,3,So the name of that place was called Taberah because the fire of Yahweh burned among them.
Numbers,11,4,"And the rabble who were among them had greedy desires; and also the sons of Israel wept again and said, “Who will give us meat to eat?"
Numbers,11,5,"We remember the fish which we used to eat free in Egypt, the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic"
Numbers,11,6,but now our appetite is dried up. There is nothing at all to look at except this manna.”
Numbers,11,7,"Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium."
Numbers,11,8,"The people would go about and gather it and grind it between two millstones or beat it in the mortar, and boil it in the pot and make cakes with it; and its taste was as the taste of cakes baked with oil."
Numbers,11,9,"And when the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it."
Numbers,11,10,"Now Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, each man at the doorway of his tent; and the anger of Yahweh was kindled greatly, and it was evil in the sight of Moses."
Numbers,11,11,"So Moses said to Yahweh, “Why have You allowed this evil toward Your slave? And why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You have laid the burden of all this people on me?"
Numbers,11,12,"Was it I who conceived all this people? Was it I who gave birth to them, that You should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom as a nurse carries a nursing baby, to the land which You swore to their fathers’?"
Numbers,11,13,"Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me, saying, ‘Give us meat that we may eat!’"
Numbers,11,14,I alone am not able to carry all this people because it is too heavy for me.
Numbers,11,15,"So if You are going to deal thus with me, please kill me at once, if I have found favor in Your sight, and do not let me see my wretchedness.”"
Numbers,11,16,"Yahweh therefore said to Moses, “Gather for Me seventy men from the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and their officers, and take them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you."
Numbers,11,17,"Then I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take of the Spirit who is upon you, and will put Him upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you will not bear it all alone."
Numbers,11,18,"And say to the people, ‘Set yourselves apart as holy for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, “Oh that someone would give us meat to eat! For it was good for us in Egypt.” Therefore Yahweh will give you meat, and you shall eat."
Numbers,11,19,"You shall eat, not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days"
Numbers,11,20,"but a whole month, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you; because you have rejected Yahweh who is among you and have wept before Him, saying, “Why did we ever go out from Egypt?” ’ ”"
Numbers,11,21,"But Moses said, “The people, among whom I am, are 600,000 on foot; yet You have said, ‘I will give them meat, so that they may eat for a whole month.’"
Numbers,11,22,"Should flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Or should all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?”"
Numbers,11,23,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Is Yahweh’s power limited? Now you shall see whether My word will happen for you or not.”"
Numbers,11,24,"So Moses went out and told the people the words of Yahweh. Also, he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and had them stand around the tent."
Numbers,11,25,"Then Yahweh came down in the cloud and spoke to him; and He took of the Spirit who was upon him and placed Him upon the seventy elders. And when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they did not do it again."
Numbers,11,26,"But two men had remained in the camp; the name of one was Eldad and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them (now they were among those who had been registered, but had not gone out to the tent), and they prophesied in the camp."
Numbers,11,27,"So a young man ran and told Moses and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”"
Numbers,11,28,"Then Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses from his youth, said, “Moses, my lord, restrain them.”"
Numbers,11,29,"But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the people of Yahweh were prophets, that Yahweh would put His Spirit upon them!”"
Numbers,11,30,"Then Moses returned to the camp, both he and the elders of Israel."
Numbers,11,31,"Now there went forth a wind from Yahweh, and it brought quail from the sea, and let them fall beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side, all around the camp and about two cubits over the surface of the ground."
Numbers,11,32,"And the people spent all day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail (he who gathered least gathered ten homers), and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp."
Numbers,11,33,"While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the people, and Yahweh struck the people with a very severe plague."
Numbers,11,34,So the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah because there they buried the people who had been greedy.
Numbers,11,35,"From Kibroth-hattaavah the people set out for Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth."
Numbers,12,1,Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had taken as a wife (for he had taken a Cushite woman)
Numbers,12,2,"and they said, “Has Yahweh indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us as well?” And Yahweh heard it."
Numbers,12,3,"(Now the man Moses was very humble, more than any man who was on the face of the earth.)"
Numbers,12,4,"Suddenly Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron and to Miriam, “You three come out to the tent of meeting.” So the three of them came out."
Numbers,12,5,"Then Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the doorway of the tent, and He called Aaron and Miriam. And then both came forward"
Numbers,12,6,"and He said,
“Hear now My words:
If there is a prophet among you,
I, Yahweh, shall make Myself known to him in a vision.
I shall speak with him in a dream."
Numbers,12,7,"“Not so, with My servant Moses,
He is faithful in all My household"
Numbers,12,8,"With him I speak mouth to mouth,
Indeed clearly, and not in riddles,
And he beholds the form of Yahweh.
Why then were you not afraid
To speak against My servant, against Moses?”"
Numbers,12,9,"So the anger of Yahweh burned against them, and He went away."
Numbers,12,10,"But the cloud withdrew from over the tent, and behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous."
Numbers,12,11,"Then Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, I beg you, do not place this sin on us, in which we have acted foolishly and in which we have sinned."
Numbers,12,12,"Oh, do not let her be like one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes from his mother’s womb!”"
Numbers,12,13,"And Moses cried out to Yahweh, saying, “O God, heal her, I pray!”"
Numbers,12,14,"But Yahweh said to Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not bear her dishonor for seven days? Let her be shut up for seven days outside the camp, and afterward she may be received again.”"
Numbers,12,15,"So Miriam was shut up outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not set out until Miriam was received again."
Numbers,12,16,"Afterward, however, the people set out from Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran."
Numbers,13,1,Then Yahweh spoke to Moses saying
Numbers,13,2,"“Send out for yourself men so that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I am going to give to the sons of Israel; you shall send a man from each of their fathers’ tribes, every one a leader among them.”"
Numbers,13,3,"So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran at the command of Yahweh, all of them men who were heads of the sons of Israel."
Numbers,13,4,"These then were their names:
from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur"
Numbers,13,5,"from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori"
Numbers,13,6,"from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh"
Numbers,13,7,"from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph"
Numbers,13,8,"from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun"
Numbers,13,9,"from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu"
Numbers,13,10,"from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi"
Numbers,13,11,"from the tribe of Joseph, from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi"
Numbers,13,12,"from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli"
Numbers,13,13,"from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael"
Numbers,13,14,"from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi"
Numbers,13,15,"from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi."
Numbers,13,16,"These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land; but Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua."
Numbers,13,17,"So Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said to them, “Go up there into the Negev; then go up into the hill country."
Numbers,13,18,"And see what the land is like, and whether the people who live in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many."
Numbers,13,19,"And how is the land in which they live, is it good or bad? And how are the cities in which they live, are they like open camps or with fortifications?"
Numbers,13,20,"And how is the land, is it fat or lean? Are there trees in it or not? Make an effort then to get some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes."
Numbers,13,21,"So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, at Lebo-hamath."
Numbers,13,22,"And they had gone up into the Negev and came to Hebron where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)"
Numbers,13,23,Then they came to the valley of Eshcol and from there cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes; and they carried it on a pole between two men with some of the pomegranates and the figs.
Numbers,13,24,"That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut down from there."
Numbers,13,25,"Then they returned from spying out the land, at the end of forty days"
Numbers,13,26,"and went and came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; and they brought back word to them and to all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land."
Numbers,13,27,"Thus they recounted to him and said, “We went in to the land where you sent us; and it certainly does flow with milk and honey, and this is its fruit."
Numbers,13,28,"Nevertheless, the people who live in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large; and moreover, we saw the descendants of Anak there."
Numbers,13,29,"Amalek is living in the land of the Negev and the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Amorites are living in the hill country, and the Canaanites are living by the sea and by the side of the Jordan.”"
Numbers,13,30,"Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, “We should by all means go up and take possession of it, for we are surely able to overcome it.”"
Numbers,13,31,"But the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people, for they are too strong for us.”"
Numbers,13,32,"So they gave out to the sons of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, “The land, which we have passed through to spy out on, is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great size."
Numbers,13,33,"There also we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak are part of the Nephilim); and we became like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight.”"
Numbers,14,1,"Then all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried, and the people wept that night."
Numbers,14,2,"And all the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron; and the whole congregation said to them, “Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this wilderness!"
Numbers,14,3,"And why is Yahweh bringing us into this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become plunder; would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?”"
Numbers,14,4,"So they said to one another, “Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt.”"
Numbers,14,5,Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in the presence of all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel.
Numbers,14,6,"And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes"
Numbers,14,7,"and they spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, “The land which we passed through to spy out is an exceedingly good land."
Numbers,14,8,"If Yahweh is pleased with us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us—a land which flows with milk and honey."
Numbers,14,9,"But as for you, only do not rebel against Yahweh; and do not fear the people of the land, for they are our bread. Their protection has been removed from them, and Yahweh is with us; do not fear them.”"
Numbers,14,10,But all the congregation said to stone them with stones. Then the glory of Yahweh appeared in the tent of meeting to all the sons of Israel.
Numbers,14,11,"Yahweh said to Moses, “How long will this people spurn Me? And how long will they not believe in Me, despite all the signs which I have done in their midst?"
Numbers,14,12,"I will strike them with pestilence and dispossess them, and I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they.”"
Numbers,14,13,"But Moses said to Yahweh, “Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for by Your power You brought up this people from their midst"
Numbers,14,14,"and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You, O Yahweh, are in the midst of this people, for You, O Yahweh, are seen eye to eye, while Your cloud stands over them; and You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night."
Numbers,14,15,"Now if You put this people to death as one man, then the nations who have heard of Your fame will say"
Numbers,14,16,"‘Because Yahweh was not able to bring this people into the land which He swore to them, therefore He slaughtered them in the wilderness.’"
Numbers,14,17,"So now, I pray, let the power of the Lord be great, just as You have declared"
Numbers,14,18,"‘Yahweh is slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but He will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generations.’"
Numbers,14,19,"Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness, just as You also have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.”"
Numbers,14,20,"So Yahweh said, “I have pardoned them according to your word"
Numbers,14,21,"but indeed, as I live, all the earth will be filled with the glory of Yahweh."
Numbers,14,22,"Surely all the men who have seen My glory and My signs which I have done in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have put Me to the test these ten times and have not listened to My voice"
Numbers,14,23,"shall by no means see the land which I swore to their fathers, nor shall any of those who spurned Me see it."
Numbers,14,24,"But My servant Caleb, because he has had a different spirit and has followed Me fully, I will bring into the land which he entered, and his seed shall take possession of it."
Numbers,14,25,Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valleys; turn tomorrow and set out to the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.”
Numbers,14,26,"Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying"
Numbers,14,27,"“How long shall I bear with this evil congregation who are grumbling against Me? I have heard the complaints of the sons of Israel, which they are making against Me."
Numbers,14,28,"Say to them, ‘As I live,’ declares Yahweh, ‘just as you have spoken in My hearing, so I will surely do to you"
Numbers,14,29,"your corpses will fall in this wilderness, even all your numbered men, according to your complete number from twenty years old and upward, who have grumbled against Me."
Numbers,14,30,"Surely you shall not come into the land in which I swore to make you dwell, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun."
Numbers,14,31,"Your little ones, however, who you said would become plunder—I will bring them in, so that they will know the land which you have rejected."
Numbers,14,32,"But as for you, your corpses will fall in this wilderness."
Numbers,14,33,"And your sons shall be shepherds for forty years in the wilderness, and they will suffer for your unfaithfulness, until your corpses come to an end in the wilderness."
Numbers,14,34,"According to the number of days which you spied out the land, forty days, for every day you shall bear your guilt a year, even forty years, and you will know My opposition."
Numbers,14,35,"I, Yahweh, have spoken, surely this I will do to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me. In this wilderness they shall come to an end, and there they will die.’ ”"
Numbers,14,36,As for the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land and who returned and made all the congregation grumble against him by bringing out a bad report concerning the land
Numbers,14,37,even those men who brought out the very bad report of the land died by a plague before Yahweh.
Numbers,14,38,But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive out of those men who went to spy out the land.
Numbers,14,39,"Then Moses spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, and the people mourned greatly."
Numbers,14,40,"In the morning, however, they rose up early and went up to the ridge of the hill country, saying, “Here we are; we will go up to the place which Yahweh has promised because we have indeed sinned.”"
Numbers,14,41,"But Moses said, “Why then do you trespass against the command of Yahweh, when it will not succeed?"
Numbers,14,42,"Do not go up, for Yahweh is not among you, so that you are not defeated before your enemies."
Numbers,14,43,"For the Amalekites and the Canaanites will be there in front of you, and you will fall by the sword, inasmuch as you have turned back from following Yahweh. And Yahweh will not be with you.”"
Numbers,14,44,But they went up heedlessly to the ridge of the hill country; neither the ark of the covenant of Yahweh nor Moses moved from the camp.
Numbers,14,45,"Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down, and struck them and beat them down as far as Hormah."
Numbers,15,1,"Now Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,15,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you enter the land of your places of habitation, which I am going to give you"
Numbers,15,3,"then make an offering by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfill a special vow, or as a freewill offering or in your appointed times, to make a soothing aroma to Yahweh, from the herd or from the flock."
Numbers,15,4,And the one who brings his offering near shall bring near to Yahweh a grain offering of one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of oil
Numbers,15,5,"and you shall prepare wine for the drink offering, one-fourth of a hin, with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb."
Numbers,15,6,Or for a ram you shall prepare as a grain offering two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-third of a hin of oil
Numbers,15,7,and for the drink offering you shall bring near one-third of a hin of wine as a soothing aroma to Yahweh.
Numbers,15,8,"And when you prepare a bull from the herd as a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to fulfill a special vow, or for peace offerings to Yahweh"
Numbers,15,9,then you shall bring near with the bull from the herd a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-half a hin of oil
Numbers,15,10,"and you shall bring near as the drink offering one-half a hin of wine as an offering by fire, as a soothing aroma to Yahweh."
Numbers,15,11,"‘Thus it shall be done for each ox, or for each ram, or for each of the male lambs, or of the goats."
Numbers,15,12,"According to the number that you prepare, so you shall do for everyone according to their number."
Numbers,15,13,"All who are native shall do these things in this manner, in bringing near an offering by fire, as a soothing aroma to Yahweh."
Numbers,15,14,"And if a sojourner sojourns with you, or one who may be among you throughout your generations, and he offers an offering by fire as a soothing aroma to Yahweh, just as you do so he shall do."
Numbers,15,15,"As for the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the sojourner who sojourns with you, a perpetual statute throughout your generations; as you are, so shall the sojourner be before Yahweh."
Numbers,15,16,There shall be one law and one judgment for you and for the sojourner who sojourns with you.’ ”
Numbers,15,17,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,15,18,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you enter the land where I am going to bring you"
Numbers,15,19,"then it shall be, that when you eat of the food of the land, you shall raise up a contribution offering to Yahweh."
Numbers,15,20,"Of the first of your dough you shall raise up a cake as a contribution offering; as the contribution offering of the threshing floor, so you shall raise it up."
Numbers,15,21,From the first of your dough you shall give to Yahweh a contribution offering throughout your generations.
Numbers,15,22,"‘But when you unintentionally fail and do not observe all these commandments, which Yahweh has spoken to Moses"
Numbers,15,23,"even all that Yahweh has commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day when Yahweh commanded and onward throughout your generations"
Numbers,15,24,"then it will be, if it is done unintentionally, hidden from the sight of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one bull from the herd for a burnt offering as a soothing aroma to Yahweh, with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the legal judgment, and one male goat for a sin offering."
Numbers,15,25,"Then the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and they will be pardoned; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering by fire to Yahweh, and their sin offering before Yahweh, for their error."
Numbers,15,26,"So all the congregation of the sons of Israel will be pardoned, with the sojourner who sojourns among them, for it happened to all the people through error."
Numbers,15,27,"‘Also if one person sins unintentionally, then he shall bring near a one year old female goat for a sin offering."
Numbers,15,28,"And the priest shall make atonement before Yahweh for the person who goes astray when he sins unintentionally, making atonement for him that he may be pardoned."
Numbers,15,29,"You shall have one law for him who does anything unintentionally, for him who is native among the sons of Israel and for the sojourner who sojourns among them."
Numbers,15,30,"But the person who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native or a sojourner, that one is blaspheming Yahweh; and that person shall be cut off from among his people."
Numbers,15,31,"Because he has despised the word of Yahweh and has broken His commandment, that person shall be completely cut off; his guilt will be on him.’ ”"
Numbers,15,32,"Now the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, and they found a man gathering wood on the sabbath day."
Numbers,15,33,And those who found him gathering wood brought him near to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation
Numbers,15,34,and they put him in custody because it had not been declared what should be done to him.
Numbers,15,35,"Then Yahweh said to Moses, “The man shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.”"
Numbers,15,36,"So all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death with stones, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses."
Numbers,15,37,"Yahweh also spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,15,38,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, and tell them that they shall make for themselves tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and that they shall put on the tassel of each corner a cord of blue."
Numbers,15,39,"And it shall be a tassel for you to look at and remember all the commandments of Yahweh, so as to do them and not follow after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you played the harlot"
Numbers,15,40,so that you may remember to do all My commandments and be holy to your God.
Numbers,15,41,I am Yahweh your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt to be your God; I am Yahweh your God.”
Numbers,16,1,"Now Korah the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took others"
Numbers,16,2,"and they rose up before Moses, together with some of the sons of Israel, 250 leaders of the congregation, those called upon by the assembly, men of renown."
Numbers,16,3,"Then they assembled together against Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “You have gone far enough, for all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and Yahweh is in their midst; so why do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of Yahweh?”"
Numbers,16,4,And Moses heard this and fell on his face
Numbers,16,5,"and he spoke to Korah and all his congregation, saying, “Tomorrow morning Yahweh will show who is His, and who is holy, and will bring him near to Himself; even the one whom He will choose, He will bring near to Himself."
Numbers,16,6,"Do this: take censers for yourselves, Korah and all your congregation"
Numbers,16,7,"and put fire in them, and lay incense upon them in the presence of Yahweh tomorrow; and the man whom Yahweh chooses shall be the one who is holy. You have gone far enough, you sons of Levi!”"
Numbers,16,8,"Then Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi"
Numbers,16,9,"is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to perform the service of the tabernacle of Yahweh, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them"
Numbers,16,10,"and that He has brought you near, Korah, and all your brothers, sons of Levi, with you? And are you seeking for the priesthood also?"
Numbers,16,11,"Therefore you and all your congregation are gathered together against Yahweh; but as for Aaron, who is he that you grumble against him?”"
Numbers,16,12,"Then Moses sent a summons to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; but they said, “We will not come up."
Numbers,16,13,"Is it not enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to put us to death in the wilderness, but you would also lord it over us?"
Numbers,16,14,"Indeed, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor have you given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Would you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!”"
Numbers,16,15,"Then Moses became very angry and said to Yahweh, “Do not regard their offering! I have not taken a single donkey from them, nor have I done harm to any of them.”"
Numbers,16,16,"And Moses said to Korah, “You and all your congregation be present before Yahweh tomorrow, both you and they along with Aaron."
Numbers,16,17,"And each of you take his firepan and put incense on it, and each of you bring his censer near before Yahweh, 250 firepans; also you and Aaron shall each bring his firepan.”"
Numbers,16,18,"So they each took his own censer and put fire on it, and laid incense on it; and they stood at the doorway of the tent of meeting, with Moses and Aaron."
Numbers,16,19,Thus Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the doorway of the tent of meeting. And the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the congregation.
Numbers,16,20,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying"
Numbers,16,21,"“Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them instantly.”"
Numbers,16,22,"But they fell on their faces and said, “O God, God of the spirits of all flesh, when one man sins, will You be angry with the entire congregation?”"
Numbers,16,23,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,16,24,"“Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get back from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.’ ”"
Numbers,16,25,"Then Moses arose and went to Dathan and Abiram, with the elders of Israel following him"
Numbers,16,26,"and he spoke to the congregation, saying, “Turn aside now from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing that belongs to them, lest you be swept away in all their sin.”"
Numbers,16,27,"So they got back from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan and Abiram; but Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the doorway of their tents, along with their wives and their sons and their little ones."
Numbers,16,28,"And Moses said, “By this you shall know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these deeds; for this is not from my heart."
Numbers,16,29,"If these men die the death of all men or if they suffer the fate of all men, then Yahweh has not sent me."
Numbers,16,30,"But if Yahweh creates an entirely new thing and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that is theirs, and they go down to Sheol alive, then you will know that these men have spurned Yahweh.”"
Numbers,16,31,"And it happened that as he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them split open"
Numbers,16,32,"and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men who belonged to Korah with their possessions."
Numbers,16,33,"So they and all that belonged to them went down to Sheol alive; and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly."
Numbers,16,34,"Then all Israel who were around them fled at their outcry, for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us up!”"
Numbers,16,35,Fire also came forth from Yahweh and consumed the 250 men who were bringing near the incense.
Numbers,16,36,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,16,37,"“Say to Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, that he shall take up the censers out of the midst of the blaze, and you scatter the burning coals abroad; for they are holy."
Numbers,16,38,"As for the censers of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, make them into hammered sheets for a plating of the altar, since they brought them near before Yahweh, and they are holy; and they shall be for a sign to the sons of Israel.”"
Numbers,16,39,"So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which the men who were burned had brought near, and they hammered them out as a plating for the altar"
Numbers,16,40,as a memorial to the sons of Israel that no outsider who is not of the seed of Aaron should come near to burn incense before Yahweh; so that he will not become like Korah and his congregation—just as Yahweh had spoken to him by the hand of Moses.
Numbers,16,41,"But on the next day all the congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You are the ones who have caused the death of the people of Yahweh.”"
Numbers,16,42,"It came about, however, when the congregation had assembled against Moses and Aaron, that they turned toward the tent of meeting, and behold, the cloud covered it and the glory of Yahweh appeared."
Numbers,16,43,Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting
Numbers,16,44,"and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,16,45,"“Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them instantly.” Then they fell on their faces."
Numbers,16,46,"And Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer and put in it fire from the altar, and lay incense on it; then bring it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, for wrath has gone forth from Yahweh, the plague has begun!”"
Numbers,16,47,"Then Aaron took it as Moses had spoken, and ran into the midst of the assembly, for behold, the plague had begun among the people. So he put on the incense and made atonement for the people."
Numbers,16,48,"And he took his stand between the dead and the living, so that the plague was checked."
Numbers,16,49,"But those who died by the plague were 14,700, besides those who died on account of Korah."
Numbers,16,50,"Then Aaron returned to Moses at the doorway of the tent of meeting, for the plague had been checked."
Numbers,17,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,17,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, and get from them a rod for each father’s household: twelve rods from all their leaders according to their fathers’ households. You shall write each name on his rod"
Numbers,17,3,and write Aaron’s name on the rod of Levi; for there is one rod for the head of each of their fathers’ households.
Numbers,17,4,"You shall then deposit them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony, where I meet with you."
Numbers,17,5,"And it will come about that the rod of the man whom I choose will sprout. Thus I will rid Myself of the grumblings of the sons of Israel, who are grumbling against you.”"
Numbers,17,6,"Moses therefore spoke to the sons of Israel, and all their leaders gave him a rod apiece, for each leader according to their fathers’ households, twelve rods, with the rod of Aaron among their rods."
Numbers,17,7,So Moses deposited the rods before Yahweh in the tent of the testimony.
Numbers,17,8,"Now it happened on the next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and put forth buds and produced flowers, and it bore ripe almonds."
Numbers,17,9,"Moses then brought out all the rods from the presence of Yahweh to all the sons of Israel; and they looked, and each man took his rod."
Numbers,17,10,"But Yahweh said to Moses, “Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony to be kept as a sign against the rebels, that you may put an end to their grumblings against Me, so that they will not die.”"
Numbers,17,11,"Thus Moses did; just as Yahweh had commanded him, so he did."
Numbers,17,12,"Then the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, “Behold, we are breathing our last breath, we are perishing, we are all perishing!"
Numbers,17,13,"Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of Yahweh, must die. Are we to breathe our utter last?”"
Numbers,18,1,"So Yahweh said to Aaron, “You and your sons and your father’s household with you shall bear the guilt in connection with the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you shall bear the guilt in connection with your priesthood."
Numbers,18,2,"But bring near with you also your brothers, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may be joined with you and minister to you, while you and your sons with you are before the tent of the testimony."
Numbers,18,3,"And they shall thus keep your responsibility and the responsibility of all the tent, but they shall not come near to the furnishings of the sanctuary and the altar, so that neither they nor you will die."
Numbers,18,4,"And they shall be joined with you and keep the responsibility of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; but an outsider may not come near you."
Numbers,18,5,"So you shall keep the responsibility of the sanctuary and the responsibility of the altar, so that there will no longer be wrath on the sons of Israel."
Numbers,18,6,"And behold, I Myself have taken your brothers the Levites from among the sons of Israel; they are a gift to you, given to Yahweh, to perform the service for the tent of meeting."
Numbers,18,7,"But you and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood in everything that concerns the altar and inside the veil, and you are to perform service. I am giving you the priesthood as a bestowed service, but the outsider who comes near shall be put to death.”"
Numbers,18,8,"Then Yahweh spoke to Aaron, “Now behold, I Myself have given you the responsibility of My contributions, even all the holy gifts of the sons of Israel I have given them to you as a portion and to your sons as a perpetual statute."
Numbers,18,9,"This shall be yours from the most holy gifts reserved from the fire; every offering of theirs, even every grain offering and every sin offering and every guilt offering, which they shall render to Me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons."
Numbers,18,10,As the most holy gifts you shall eat it; every male shall eat it. It shall be holy to you.
Numbers,18,11,"This also is yours, the contribution from their gift, even all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel; I have given them to you and to your sons and daughters with you as a perpetual statute. Everyone of your household who is clean may eat it."
Numbers,18,12,"All the best of the fresh oil and all the best of the fresh wine and of the grain, the first fruits of those which they give to Yahweh, I give them to you."
Numbers,18,13,"The first ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to Yahweh, shall be yours; everyone of your household who is clean may eat it."
Numbers,18,14,Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours.
Numbers,18,15,"Every first issue of the womb of all flesh, whether man or animal, which they bring near to Yahweh, shall be yours; nevertheless the firstborn of man you shall surely redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem."
Numbers,18,16,"Now as to their redemption price, from a month old you shall redeem them, by your valuation, five shekels in silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs."
Numbers,18,17,"But the firstborn of an ox or the firstborn of a sheep or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall splash their blood on the altar and shall offer up their fat in smoke as an offering by fire, for a soothing aroma to Yahweh."
Numbers,18,18,And their meat shall be yours; it shall be yours like the breast of a wave offering and like the right thigh.
Numbers,18,19,"All the contributions of the holy gifts, which the sons of Israel raise up to Yahweh, I have given to you and your sons and your daughters with you, as a perpetual statute. It is an everlasting covenant of salt before Yahweh to you and your seed with you.”"
Numbers,18,20,"Then Yahweh said to Aaron, “You shall have no inheritance in their land nor own any portion among them; I am your portion and your inheritance among the sons of Israel."
Numbers,18,21,"“Now to the sons of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they perform, the service of the tent of meeting."
Numbers,18,22,"And the sons of Israel shall not come near the tent of meeting again, or they will bear sin and die."
Numbers,18,23,"Only the Levites shall perform the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations, and among the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance."
Numbers,18,24,"For the tithe of the sons of Israel, which they raise up as a contribution offering to Yahweh, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance; therefore I have said concerning them, ‘They shall have no inheritance among the sons of Israel.’ ”"
Numbers,18,25,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,18,26,"“Moreover, you shall speak to the Levites and say to them, ‘When you take from the sons of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall raise up a contribution offering from it to Yahweh, a tithe of the tithe."
Numbers,18,27,And your contribution offering shall be reckoned to you as the grain from the threshing floor or the full produce from the wine vat.
Numbers,18,28,"So you shall also raise up a contribution offering to Yahweh from all your tithes, which you receive from the sons of Israel; and from it you shall give the contribution offering of Yahweh to Aaron the priest."
Numbers,18,29,"Out of all your gifts you shall raise up every contribution offering due to Yahweh, from all the best of them, the sacred part from them.’"
Numbers,18,30,"And you shall say to them, ‘When you have raised up from it the best of it, then the rest shall be accounted to the Levites as the product of the threshing floor and as the product of the wine vat."
Numbers,18,31,"And you may eat it anywhere, you and your households, for it is your compensation in return for your service in the tent of meeting."
Numbers,18,32,"And you will bear no sin by reason of it when you have raised up the best of it. But you shall not profane the sacred gifts of the sons of Israel, so that you will not die.’ ”"
Numbers,19,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying"
Numbers,19,2,"“This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded, saying, ‘Speak to the sons of Israel that they take to you a red heifer without blemish, in which is no defect and on which a yoke has never been placed."
Numbers,19,3,"And you shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and it shall be brought outside the camp and be slaughtered in his presence."
Numbers,19,4,Next Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle some of its blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.
Numbers,19,5,"Then the heifer shall be burned in his sight; its hide and its flesh and its blood, with its refuse, shall be burned."
Numbers,19,6,And the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet material and cast it into the midst of the burning heifer.
Numbers,19,7,"The priest shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in water and afterward come into the camp, but the priest shall be unclean until evening."
Numbers,19,8,The one who burns it shall also wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water and shall be unclean until evening.
Numbers,19,9,"Now a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place, and the congregation of the sons of Israel shall keep it as water to remove impurity; it is purification from sin."
Numbers,19,10,And the one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening; and it shall be a perpetual statute to the sons of Israel and to the sojourner who sojourns among them.
Numbers,19,11,‘The one who touches the corpse of any person shall be unclean for seven days.
Numbers,19,12,"That one shall purify himself from uncleanness with the water on the third day and on the seventh day, and then he will be clean; but if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not be clean."
Numbers,19,13,"Anyone who touches a corpse, the body of a man who has died, and does not purify himself, makes the tabernacle of Yahweh unclean; and that person shall be cut off from Israel. Because the water for impurity was not splashed on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him."
Numbers,19,14,‘This is the law when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent shall be unclean for seven days.
Numbers,19,15,"And every open vessel, which has no covering tied down on it, shall be unclean."
Numbers,19,16,"Also, anyone who in the open field touches one who has been slain with a sword or who has died naturally, or a human bone or a grave, shall be unclean for seven days."
Numbers,19,17,Then for the unclean person they shall take some of the ashes of the burnt purification from sin and flowing water shall be added to them in a vessel.
Numbers,19,18,And a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it on the tent and on all the furnishings and on the persons who were there and on the one who touched the bone or the one slain or the one dying naturally or the grave.
Numbers,19,19,"Then the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify him from uncleanness, and he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean by evening."
Numbers,19,20,"‘But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself from uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly because he has made the sanctuary of Yahweh unclean; the water for impurity has not been splashed on him; he is unclean."
Numbers,19,21,"So it shall be a perpetual statute for them. And he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening."
Numbers,19,22,"Furthermore, anything that the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the person who touches it shall be unclean until evening.’ ”"
Numbers,20,1,"Then the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came to the wilderness of Zin in the first month; and the people stayed at Kadesh. And Miriam died there and was buried there."
Numbers,20,2,"Now there was no water for the congregation, and they assembled themselves against Moses and Aaron."
Numbers,20,3,"The people thus contended with Moses and spoke, saying, “If only we had breathed our last when our brothers breathed their last before Yahweh!"
Numbers,20,4,"Why then have you brought the assembly of Yahweh into this wilderness, for us and our beasts to die here?"
Numbers,20,5,"And why have you made us come up from Egypt, to bring us into this evil place? It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, nor is there water to drink.”"
Numbers,20,6,Then Moses and Aaron came in from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces. Then the glory of Yahweh appeared to them
Numbers,20,7,"and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,20,8,"“Take the rod; and you and your brother Aaron assemble the congregation and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it may yield its water. You shall thus bring forth water for them out of the rock and let the congregation and their beasts drink.”"
Numbers,20,9,"So Moses took the rod from before Yahweh, just as He had commanded him"
Numbers,20,10,"and Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly before the rock. And he said to them, “Listen now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?”"
Numbers,20,11,"Then Moses raised high his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod; and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation and their beasts drank."
Numbers,20,12,"But Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not believe Me, to treat Me as holy in the sight of the sons of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.”"
Numbers,20,13,"Those were the waters of Meribah because the sons of Israel contended with Yahweh, and He proved Himself holy among them."
Numbers,20,14,"From Kadesh Moses then sent messengers to the king of Edom: “Thus your brother Israel has said, ‘You know all the hardship that has befallen us"
Numbers,20,15,"that our fathers went down to Egypt, and we stayed in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians treated us and our fathers badly."
Numbers,20,16,"So we cried out to Yahweh, and He heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out from Egypt; now behold, we are at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory."
Numbers,20,17,Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard; we will not even drink water from a well. We will go along the king’s highway; we will not turn to the right or to the left until we pass through your territory.’ ”
Numbers,20,18,"Edom, however, said to him, “You shall not pass through us, lest I come out to meet you with the sword.”"
Numbers,20,19,"Again, the sons of Israel said to him, “We will go up by the highway, and if I and my livestock do drink any of your water, then I will pay its price. Let me only pass through on my feet, nothing else.”"
Numbers,20,20,"But he said, “You shall not pass through.” And Edom came out to meet him with a heavy force and with a strong hand."
Numbers,20,21,Thus Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his territory; so Israel turned away from him.
Numbers,20,22,"Then they set out from Kadesh, and the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor."
Numbers,20,23,"And Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom, saying"
Numbers,20,24,"“Aaron will be gathered to his people, for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the sons of Israel because you rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah."
Numbers,20,25,Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up to Mount Hor
Numbers,20,26,and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar. So Aaron will be gathered to his people and will die there.”
Numbers,20,27,"So Moses did just as Yahweh had commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation."
Numbers,20,28,"And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on his son Eleazar, and Aaron died there on the mountain top. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain."
Numbers,20,29,"So all the congregation saw that Aaron breathed his last, and all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days."
Numbers,21,1,"Then the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, and he fought against Israel and took some of them captive."
Numbers,21,2,"So Israel made a vow to Yahweh and said, “If You will indeed give this people into my hand, then I will devote their cities to destruction.”"
Numbers,21,3,Then Yahweh heard the voice of Israel and gave the Canaanites over; so they devoted them and their cities to destruction. Thus the name of the place was called Hormah.
Numbers,21,4,"Then they set out from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the people became impatient on the way."
Numbers,21,5,"And the people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this miserable food.”"
Numbers,21,6,"So Yahweh sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people so that many people of Israel died."
Numbers,21,7,"Then the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned because we have spoken against Yahweh and against you; pray to Yahweh, that He may remove the serpents from us.” And Moses prayed for the people."
Numbers,21,8,"Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent and set it on a standard; and it will be that everyone who is bitten and looks at it, will live.”"
Numbers,21,9,"And Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on the standard; and it happened, that if a serpent bit any man, when he looked to the bronze serpent, he lived."
Numbers,21,10,Then the sons of Israel set out and camped in Oboth.
Numbers,21,11,"They then set out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness which is opposite Moab, east toward the sunrise."
Numbers,21,12,From there they set out and camped in Wadi Zered.
Numbers,21,13,"From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites."
Numbers,21,14,"Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of Yahweh,
“Waheb in Suphah,
And the wadis of the Arnon"
Numbers,21,15,"And the slope of the wadis
That extends to the site of Ar,
And leans to the border of Moab.”"
Numbers,21,16,"And from there they continued to Beer, that is the well where Yahweh said to Moses, “Assemble the people, that I may give them water.”"
Numbers,21,17,"Then Israel sang this song:
“Spring up, O well! Sing to it!"
Numbers,21,18,"“The well, which the leaders dug,
Which the nobles of the people carved out,
With the scepter and with their staffs.”
And from the wilderness they continued to Mattanah"
Numbers,21,19,"and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth"
Numbers,21,20,"and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the land of Moab, at the top of Pisgah which overlooks the wasteland."
Numbers,21,21,"Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying"
Numbers,21,22,“Let me pass through your land. We will not turn off into field or vineyard; we will not drink water from wells. We will go by the king’s highway until we have passed through your border.”
Numbers,21,23,But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border. So Sihon gathered all his people and went out to meet Israel in the wilderness and came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.
Numbers,21,24,"Then Israel struck him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the sons of Ammon; for the border of the sons of Ammon was Jazer."
Numbers,21,25,"And Israel took all these cities, and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all her towns."
Numbers,21,26,"For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites. Now it was he who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon."
Numbers,21,27,"Therefore those who use proverbs say,
“Come to Heshbon! Let it be built!
So let the city of Sihon be established."
Numbers,21,28,"“For a fire went forth from Heshbon,
A flame from the town of Sihon;
It devoured Ar of Moab,
The dominant heights of the Arnon."
Numbers,21,29,"“Woe to you, O Moab!
You perish, O people of Chemosh!
He has given his sons as fugitives,
And his daughters into captivity,
To an Amorite king, Sihon."
Numbers,21,30,"“But we have cast them down,
Heshbon perishes as far as Dibon,
And we have made desolate even to Nophah,
Which reaches to Medeba.”"
Numbers,21,31,Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers,21,32,"And Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they captured its towns and dispossessed the Amorites who were there."
Numbers,21,33,"Then they turned and went up by the way of Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan went out to meet them, he and all his people for battle at Edrei."
Numbers,21,34,"But Yahweh said to Moses, “Do not fear him, for I have given him into your hand, and all his people and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.”"
Numbers,21,35,"So they struck down him and his sons and all his people, until there was no survivor remaining for him; and they possessed his land."
Numbers,22,1,Then the sons of Israel set out and camped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan opposite Jericho.
Numbers,22,2,And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
Numbers,22,3,"So Moab was in great fear because of the people, for they were numerous; and Moab was in dread of the sons of Israel."
Numbers,22,4,"Then Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now this assembly will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.” And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time."
Numbers,22,5,"So he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, at Pethor, which is near the River, in the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying, “Behold, a people came out of Egypt; behold, they cover the surface of the land, and they are settled opposite me."
Numbers,22,6,"So now, please come, curse this people for me since they are too mighty for me; perhaps I may be able to strike them down and drive them out of the land. For I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”"
Numbers,22,7,So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian went away with the fees for divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam and spoke Balak’s words to him.
Numbers,22,8,"And he said to them, “Spend the night here, and I will bring word back to you as Yahweh may speak to me.” And the leaders of Moab stayed with Balaam."
Numbers,22,9,"Then God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men with you?”"
Numbers,22,10,"And Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent word to me"
Numbers,22,11,"‘Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt, and they cover the surface of the land; now come, curse them for me; perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them out.’ ”"
Numbers,22,12,"And God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.”"
Numbers,22,13,"So Balaam arose in the morning and said to Balak’s leaders, “Go back to your land, for Yahweh has refused to allow me to go with you.”"
Numbers,22,14,"And the leaders of Moab arose and came to Balak and said, “Balaam refused to go with us.”"
Numbers,22,15,"Then Balak again sent leaders, more numerous and more honorable than the former."
Numbers,22,16,"And they came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, ‘Let nothing, I beg you, withhold you from coming to me"
Numbers,22,17,"for I will indeed honor you richly, and I will do whatever you say to me. Please come then, curse this people for me.’ ”"
Numbers,22,18,"And Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, “Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything, either small or great, to trespass the command of Yahweh my God."
Numbers,22,19,"So now, please, you also stay here tonight, and I will know what else Yahweh will speak to me.”"
Numbers,22,20,"And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise up and go with them; but only the word which I speak to you shall you do.”"
Numbers,22,21,So Balaam arose in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the leaders of Moab.
Numbers,22,22,"But God was angry because he was going, so the angel of Yahweh took his stand in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two young men were with him."
Numbers,22,23,"Then the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way with his drawn sword in his hand, and the donkey turned off from the way and went into the field; so Balaam struck the donkey to turn it back into the way."
Numbers,22,24,"Then the angel of Yahweh stood in a narrow path of the vineyards, with a wall on this side and a wall on that side."
Numbers,22,25,"And the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and it pressed itself to the wall and pressed Balaam’s foot against the wall, so he struck it again."
Numbers,22,26,And the angel of Yahweh passed on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right hand or the left.
Numbers,22,27,Then the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh and lay down under Balaam; so Balaam was angry and struck the donkey with his stick.
Numbers,22,28,"And Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and it said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”"
Numbers,22,29,"Then Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have made a mockery of me! If there had been a sword in my hand, I would have killed you by now.”"
Numbers,22,30,"And the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I ever been accustomed to do so to you?” And he said, “No.”"
Numbers,22,31,"Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way with his drawn sword in his hand; and he bowed his head down and prostrated himself to the ground."
Numbers,22,32,"And the angel of Yahweh said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary because your way was contrary to me."
Numbers,22,33,"And the donkey saw me and turned aside from me these three times. If it had not turned aside from me, I would surely have killed you just now, and let it live.”"
Numbers,22,34,"And Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, “I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing in the way against me. So now, if it is evil in your sight, I will turn back.”"
Numbers,22,35,"But the angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but you shall speak only the word which I tell you.” So Balaam went along with the leaders of Balak."
Numbers,22,36,"Then Balak heard that Balaam was coming and went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is on the Arnon border, at the end of the border."
Numbers,22,37,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not urgently send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I indeed unable to honor you?”"
Numbers,22,38,"So Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come now to you! Am I able to speak anything at all? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I shall speak.”"
Numbers,22,39,"And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth."
Numbers,22,40,"And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent some to Balaam and the leaders who were with him."
Numbers,22,41,"Then it happened in the morning that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal, and he saw from there the end of the camp of the people."
Numbers,23,1,"Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.”"
Numbers,23,2,"So Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered up a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,23,3,"Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stand beside your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me, and whatever He shows me I will tell you.” So he went to a bare hill."
Numbers,23,4,"Now God met Balaam, and he said to Him, “I have set up the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.”"
Numbers,23,5,"Then Yahweh put a word in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and you shall speak thus.”"
Numbers,23,6,"So he returned to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, he and all the leaders of Moab."
Numbers,23,7,"Then he took up his discourse and said,
“From Aram Balak has brought me,
Moab’s king from the mountains of the East,
‘Come curse Jacob for me,
And come, denounce Israel!’"
Numbers,23,8,"“How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?
And how can I denounce whom Yahweh has not denounced?"
Numbers,23,9,"“For I see him from the top of the rocks,
And I look at him from the hills;
Behold, a people who dwells alone,
And will not be reckoned among the nations."
Numbers,23,10,"“Who can number the dust of Jacob,
Or count the fourth part of Israel?
Let me die the death of the upright,
And let my end be like his!”"
Numbers,23,11,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have blessed them repeatedly!”"
Numbers,23,12,"And he replied, “Must I not be careful to speak what Yahweh puts in my mouth?”"
Numbers,23,13,"Then Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place from where you may see them, but you will only see the end of them and will not see all of them; and curse them for me from there.”"
Numbers,23,14,"So he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar."
Numbers,23,15,"And he said to Balak, “Stand here beside your burnt offering while I myself meet Yahweh over there.”"
Numbers,23,16,"Then Yahweh met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.”"
Numbers,23,17,"So he came to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the leaders of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, “What has Yahweh spoken?”"
Numbers,23,18,"Then he took up his discourse and said,
“Arise, O Balak, and hear;
Give ear to me, O son of Zippor!"
Numbers,23,19,"“God is not a man, that He should lie,
Nor a son of man, that He should repent;
Has He said, and will He not do it?
Or has He spoken, and will He not establish it?"
Numbers,23,20,"“Behold, I have received a command to bless;
When He has blessed, then I cannot revoke it."
Numbers,23,21,"“He has not observed misfortune in Jacob;
Nor has He seen trouble in Israel;
Yahweh his God is with him,
And the shout of a king is among them."
Numbers,23,22,"“God brings them out of Egypt,
He is for them like the horns of the wild ox."
Numbers,23,23,"“For there is no omen against Jacob,
Nor is there any divination against Israel;
At the proper time it shall be said to Jacob
And to Israel, what God has done!"
Numbers,23,24,"“Behold, a people rises like a lioness,
And as a lion it lifts itself;
It will not lie down until it devours the prey,
And drinks the blood of the slain.”"
Numbers,23,25,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Do not curse them at all nor bless them at all!”"
Numbers,23,26,"But Balaam replied to Balak, “Did I not tell you, saying, ‘Whatever Yahweh speaks, that I must do’?”"
Numbers,23,27,"Then Balak said to Balaam, “Please come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will be right in the eyes of God that you curse them for me from there.”"
Numbers,23,28,So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor which overlooks the wasteland.
Numbers,23,29,"And Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.”"
Numbers,23,30,And Balak did just as Balaam had said and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.
Numbers,24,1,"And Balaam saw that it was good in the eyes of Yahweh to bless Israel, so he did not go as at other times to encounter omens, but he set his face toward the wilderness."
Numbers,24,2,And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel dwelling tribe by tribe; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
Numbers,24,3,"Then he took up his discourse and said,
“The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor,
And the oracle of the man whose eye is uncovered"
Numbers,24,4,"The oracle of him who hears the words of God,
Who beholds the vision of the Almighty,
Falling down, yet having his eyes opened"
Numbers,24,5,"How fair are your tents, O Jacob,
Your dwellings, O Israel!"
Numbers,24,6,"“Like valleys that stretch out,
Like gardens beside the river,
Like aloes planted by Yahweh,
Like cedars beside the waters."
Numbers,24,7,"“Water will flow from his buckets,
And his seed will be by many waters,
And his king shall be lifted up higher than Agag,
And his kingdom shall be exalted."
Numbers,24,8,"“God brings him out of Egypt,
He is for him like the horns of the wild ox.
He will devour the nations who are his adversaries,
And will gnaw their bones in pieces,
And shatter them with his arrows."
Numbers,24,9,"“He crouches, he lies down as a lion,
And as a lion, who dares rouse him?
Blessed is everyone who blesses you,
And cursed is everyone who curses you.”"
Numbers,24,10,"Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have blessed them repeatedly these three times!"
Numbers,24,11,"So now, flee to your place. I said I would honor you greatly, but behold, Yahweh has held you back from honor.”"
Numbers,24,12,"And Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not tell your messengers whom you had sent to me, saying"
Numbers,24,13,"‘Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything to trespass the command of Yahweh, either good or bad, of my own accord. What Yahweh speaks, that I will speak’?"
Numbers,24,14,"So now, behold, I am going to my people; come, and I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the last days.”"
Numbers,24,15,"Then he took up his discourse and said,
“The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor,
And the oracle of the man whose eye is uncovered"
Numbers,24,16,"The oracle of him who hears the words of God,
And knows the knowledge of the Most High,
Who beholds the vision of the Almighty,
Falling down, yet having his eyes opened."
Numbers,24,17,"“I see him, but not now;
I behold him, but not near;
A star shall come forth from Jacob,
A scepter shall rise from Israel,
And shall crush through the forehead of Moab,
And tear down all the sons of Sheth."
Numbers,24,18,"“And Edom shall be a possession,
Seir, its enemies, also will be a possession,
While Israel performs valiantly."
Numbers,24,19,"“And one from Jacob shall have dominion,
And will make the survivor perish from the city.”"
Numbers,24,20,"Then he looked at Amalek and took up his discourse and said,
“Amalek was the first of the nations,
But his end shall be destruction.”"
Numbers,24,21,"Then he looked at the Kenite and took up his discourse and said,
“Your habitation is enduring,
And your nest is set in the cliff."
Numbers,24,22,"“Nevertheless Kain will be consumed;
How long will Asshur keep you captive?”"
Numbers,24,23,"Then he took up his discourse and said,
“Woe, who can live except when God has ordained it?"
Numbers,24,24,"“But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim,
And they shall afflict Asshur and will afflict Eber;
So they also will come to destruction.”"
Numbers,24,25,"Then Balaam arose and went and returned to his place, and Balak also went his way."
Numbers,25,1,"And Israel remained at Shittim, and the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab."
Numbers,25,2,"Indeed they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods."
Numbers,25,3,"So Israel joined themselves to Baal of Peor, and the anger of Yahweh burned against Israel."
Numbers,25,4,"And Yahweh said to Moses, “Take all who are the heads of the people and execute them in broad daylight before Yahweh, so that the burning anger of Yahweh may turn away from Israel.”"
Numbers,25,5,"So Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Each of you kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal of Peor.”"
Numbers,25,6,"Then behold, one of the sons of Israel came and brought near to his brothers a Midianite woman, in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, while they were weeping at the doorway of the tent of meeting."
Numbers,25,7,"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, so he arose from the midst of the congregation and took a spear in his hand"
Numbers,25,8,"and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and pierced both of them through, the man of Israel and the woman, through the body. Then the plague on the sons of Israel was checked."
Numbers,25,9,"So those who died by the plague were 24,000."
Numbers,25,10,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,25,11,"“Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned away My wrath from the sons of Israel in that he was jealous with My jealousy among them, so that I did not consume the sons of Israel in My jealousy."
Numbers,25,12,"Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give him My covenant of peace"
Numbers,25,13,"and it shall be for him and his seed after him, a covenant of a perpetual priesthood, because he was jealous for his God and made atonement for the sons of Israel.’ ”"
Numbers,25,14,"Now the name of the slain man of Israel who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, a leader of a father’s household among the Simeonites."
Numbers,25,15,"And the name of the Midianite woman, who was struck down, was Cozbi the daughter of Zur, who was head of the people of a father’s household in Midian."
Numbers,25,16,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,25,17,“Be hostile to the Midianites and strike them
Numbers,25,18,"for they have been hostile to you with their deceptive tricks, with which they have deceived you in the affair of Peor and in the affair of Cozbi, the daughter of the leader of Midian, their sister who was slain on the day of the plague because of Peor.”"
Numbers,26,1,"Then it happened after the plague, that Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying"
Numbers,26,2,"“Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers’ households, whoever is able to go out to war in Israel.”"
Numbers,26,3,"So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying"
Numbers,26,4,"“Take a census of the people from twenty years old and upward, as Yahweh has commanded Moses.”
N ow the sons of Israel who came out of the land of Egypt were"
Numbers,26,5,"Reuben, Israel’s firstborn, the sons of Reuben:

Numbers,26,8,And the son of Pallu: Eliab.
Numbers,26,9,"And the sons of Eliab:
Nemuel and Dathan and Abiram. These are the Dathan and Abiram who were called upon by the congregation, who contended against Moses and against Aaron in the congregation of Korah, when they contended against Yahweh"
Numbers,26,10,"and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up along with Korah, when that congregation died, when the fire consumed 250 men, so that they became a warning."

Numbers,26,53,“Among these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.
Numbers,26,54,"To the larger group you shall increase their inheritance, and to the smaller group you shall diminish their inheritance; each shall be given their inheritance according to those who were numbered of them."
Numbers,26,55,But the land shall be divided by lot. They shall receive their inheritance according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.
Numbers,26,56,"According to the selection by lot, their inheritance shall be divided between the larger and the smaller groups.”"
Numbers,26,57,"And these are those who were numbered of the Levites according to their families:
of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites;
of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites;
of Merari, the family of the Merarites."
Numbers,26,58,"These are the families of Levi:
the family of the Libnites,
the family of the Hebronites,
the family of the Mahlites,
the family of the Mushites,
the family of the Korahites. Kohath became the father of Amram."
Numbers,26,59,"And the name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt; and she bore to Amram: Aaron and Moses and their sister Miriam."
Numbers,26,60,"And to Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar."
Numbers,26,61,But Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before Yahweh.
Numbers,26,62,"And those who were numbered of them were 23,000, every male from a month old and upward, for they were not numbered among the sons of Israel since no inheritance was given to them among the sons of Israel."
Numbers,26,63,"These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho."
Numbers,26,64,"But among these there was not a man of those who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai."
Numbers,26,65,"For Yahweh had said of them, “They shall surely die in the wilderness.” And not a man was left of them, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun."
Numbers,27,1,"Then the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph, came near; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah and Hoglah and Milcah and Tirzah."
Numbers,27,2,"And they stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest and before the leaders and all the congregation, at the doorway of the tent of meeting, saying"
Numbers,27,3,"“Our father died in the wilderness, yet he was not among the congregation of those who gathered themselves together against Yahweh in the congregation of Korah; but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons."
Numbers,27,4,Why should the name of our father be withdrawn from among his family because he had no son? Give us a possession among our father’s brothers.”
Numbers,27,5,So Moses brought their case near before Yahweh.
Numbers,27,6,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,27,7,"“The daughters of Zelophehad are right in their statements. You shall surely give them a possession for an inheritance among their father’s brothers, and you shall have the inheritance of their father pass on to them."
Numbers,27,8,"Further, you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘If a man dies and has no son, then you shall have his inheritance pass on to his daughter."
Numbers,27,9,"And if he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers."
Numbers,27,10,"And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers."
Numbers,27,11,"And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his blood relative in his own family, and he shall possess it; and it shall be a statutory judgment to the sons of Israel, just as Yahweh commanded Moses.’ ”"
Numbers,27,12,"Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Go up to this mountain of Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the sons of Israel."
Numbers,27,13,"So when you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was"
Numbers,27,14,"for in the wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against My command to treat Me as holy before their eyes at the water.” (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)"
Numbers,27,15,"Then Moses spoke to Yahweh, saying"
Numbers,27,16,"“May Yahweh, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation"
Numbers,27,17,"who will go out and come in before them, and who will lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of Yahweh will not be like sheep which have no shepherd.”"
Numbers,27,18,"So Yahweh said to Moses, “Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him"
Numbers,27,19,"and have him stand before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation, and commission him in their sight."
Numbers,27,20,"And you shall put some of your splendor on him, in order that all the congregation of the sons of Israel may obey him."
Numbers,27,21,"Moreover, he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Yahweh. At his command they shall go out, and at his command they shall come in, both he and the sons of Israel with him, even all the congregation.”"
Numbers,27,22,So Moses did just as Yahweh commanded him; and he took Joshua and had him stand before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation.
Numbers,27,23,"Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, just as Yahweh had spoken by the hand of Moses."
Numbers,28,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,28,2,"“Command the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘You shall be careful to bring near My offering, My food for My offerings by fire, of a soothing aroma to Me, at their appointed time.’"
Numbers,28,3,"And you shall say to them, ‘This is the offering by fire which you shall bring near to Yahweh: two male lambs one year old without blemish as a continual burnt offering every day."
Numbers,28,4,"You shall offer the one lamb in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight"
Numbers,28,5,"also a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil."
Numbers,28,6,"It is a continual burnt offering which was ordained in Mount Sinai as a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to Yahweh."
Numbers,28,7,"Then the drink offering with it shall be a fourth of a hin for each lamb, in the holy place you shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to Yahweh."
Numbers,28,8,"And the other lamb you shall offer at twilight; as the grain offering of the morning and as its drink offering, you shall offer it, an offering by fire, a soothing aroma to Yahweh."
Numbers,28,9,"‘Then on the sabbath day two male lambs one year old without blemish, and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and its drink offering"
Numbers,28,10,This is the burnt offering of every sabbath in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.
Numbers,28,11,"‘Then at the beginning of each of your months you shall bring near a burnt offering to Yahweh: two bulls from the herd and one ram, seven male lambs one year old without blemish"
Numbers,28,12,"and three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, for each bull; and two-tenths of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, for the one ram"
Numbers,28,13,"and a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering for each lamb, for a burnt offering of a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to Yahweh."
Numbers,28,14,And their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull and a third of a hin for the ram and a fourth of a hin for a lamb; this is the burnt offering of each month throughout the months of the year.
Numbers,28,15,And one male goat for a sin offering to Yahweh; it shall be offered with its drink offering in addition to the continual burnt offering.
Numbers,28,16,‘Then on the fourteenth day of the first month shall be the Passover of Yahweh.
Numbers,28,17,And on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast; unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days.
Numbers,28,18,On the first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work.
Numbers,28,19,"And you shall bring near an offering by fire, a burnt offering to Yahweh: two bulls from the herd and one ram and seven male lambs one year old; they shall be for you without blemish."
Numbers,28,20,"Now as for their grain offering, you shall offer fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for a bull and two-tenths for the ram."
Numbers,28,21,A tenth of an ephah you shall offer for each of the seven lambs
Numbers,28,22,and one male goat for a sin offering to make atonement for you.
Numbers,28,23,"You shall offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering."
Numbers,28,24,"After this manner you shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering by fire, of a soothing aroma to Yahweh; it shall be offered with its drink offering in addition to the continual burnt offering."
Numbers,28,25,Now on the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work.
Numbers,28,26,"‘Also on the day of the first fruits, when you bring near a new grain offering to Yahweh in your Feast of Weeks, you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work."
Numbers,28,27,"And you shall bring near a burnt offering for a soothing aroma to Yahweh: two bulls from the herd, one ram, seven male lambs one year old"
Numbers,28,28,"and their grain offering, fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for each bull, two-tenths for the one ram"
Numbers,28,29,a tenth for each of the seven lambs
Numbers,28,30,also one male goat to make atonement for you.
Numbers,28,31,"Besides the continual burnt offering and its grain offering, you shall offer them with their drink offerings. They shall be without blemish."
Numbers,29,1,"‘Now in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall also have a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work. It will be to you a day for blowing trumpets."
Numbers,29,2,"And you shall offer a burnt offering as a soothing aroma to Yahweh: one bull from the herd, one ram, and seven male lambs one year old without blemish"
Numbers,29,3,"also their grain offering, fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for the bull, two-tenths for the ram"
Numbers,29,4,and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs.
Numbers,29,5,"And offer one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you"
Numbers,29,6,"besides the burnt offering of the new moon and its grain offering, and the continual burnt offering and its grain offering, and their drink offerings, according to their legal judgment, for a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to Yahweh."
Numbers,29,7,"‘Then on the tenth day of this seventh month you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall humble yourselves; you shall not do any work."
Numbers,29,8,"And you shall bring near a burnt offering to Yahweh as a soothing aroma: one bull from the herd, one ram, seven male lambs one year old, having them without blemish"

Numbers,29,13,"And you shall bring near a burnt offering, an offering by fire as a soothing aroma to Yahweh: thirteen bulls from the herd, two rams, fourteen male lambs one year old, which are without blemish"
Numbers,29,14,"and their grain offering, fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for each of the thirteen bulls, two-tenths for each of the two rams"
Numbers,29,15,and a tenth for each of the fourteen lambs
Numbers,29,16,"and one male goat for a sin offering, besides the continual burnt offering, its grain offering, and its drink offering."
Numbers,29,17,"‘Then on the second day: twelve bulls from the herd, two rams, fourteen male lambs one year old without blemish"
Numbers,29,18,"and their grain offering and their drink offerings for the bulls, for the rams and for the lambs, by their number according to the legal judgment"
Numbers,29,19,"and one male goat for a sin offering, besides the continual burnt offering and its grain offering and their drink offerings."
Numbers,29,20,"‘Then on the third day: eleven bulls, two rams, fourteen male lambs one year old without blemish"
Numbers,29,21,"and their grain offering and their drink offerings for the bulls, for the rams and for the lambs, by their number according to the legal judgment"

Numbers,29,39,"‘You shall offer these to Yahweh at your appointed times, besides your votive offerings and your freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings and for your grain offerings and for your drink offerings and for your peace offerings.’ ”"
Numbers,29,40,And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel according to all that Yahweh had commanded Moses.
Numbers,30,1,"Then Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel, saying, “This is the word which Yahweh has commanded."
Numbers,30,2,"If a man makes a vow to Yahweh or swears an oath to bind himself with a binding obligation, he shall not violate his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth."
Numbers,30,3,“Also if a woman makes a vow to Yahweh and binds herself by an obligation in her father’s house in her youth
Numbers,30,4,"and her father hears her vow and her obligation by which she has bound herself, and her father says nothing to her, then all her vows shall stand, and every obligation by which she has bound herself shall stand."
Numbers,30,5,"But if her father should forbid her on the day he hears of it, none of her vows or her obligations by which she has bound herself shall stand; and Yahweh will pardon her because her father had forbidden her."
Numbers,30,6,"“However, if she should marry while under her vows or the rash statement of her lips by which she has bound herself"
Numbers,30,7,"and her husband hears of it and says nothing to her on the day he hears it, then her vows shall stand, and her obligations by which she has bound herself shall stand."
Numbers,30,8,"But if, on the day her husband hears of it, he forbids her, then he shall annul her vow which she is under and the rash statement of her lips by which she has bound herself; and Yahweh will pardon her."
Numbers,30,9,"“But the vow of a widow or of a divorced woman, everything by which she has bound herself, shall stand against her."
Numbers,30,10,"However, if she vowed in her husband’s house or bound herself by an obligation with an oath"
Numbers,30,11,"and her husband heard it but said nothing to her and did not forbid her, then all her vows shall stand, and every obligation by which she bound herself shall stand."
Numbers,30,12,"But if her husband indeed annuls them on the day he hears them, then whatever proceeds out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning the obligation of herself shall not stand; her husband has annulled them, and Yahweh will pardon her."
Numbers,30,13,"“Every vow and every binding oath to humble herself, her husband may cause it to stand, or her husband may annul it."
Numbers,30,14,"But if her husband indeed says nothing to her from day to day, then he causes all her vows or all her obligations which are on her to stand; he has caused them to stand because he said nothing to her on the day he heard them."
Numbers,30,15,"But if he indeed annuls them after he has heard them, then he shall bear her guilt.”"
Numbers,30,16,"These are the statutes which Yahweh commanded Moses, as between a man and his wife, and as between a father and his daughter, while she is in her youth in her father’s house."
Numbers,31,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,31,2,“Take full vengeance for the sons of Israel on the Midianites; afterward you will be gathered to your people.”
Numbers,31,3,"And Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian to execute Yahweh’s vengeance on Midian."
Numbers,31,4,One thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel you shall send to the war.”
Numbers,31,5,"So there were furnished from the thousands of Israel, one thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for war."
Numbers,31,6,"And Moses sent them, one thousand from each tribe, to the war, and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war with them, and the holy vessels and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand."
Numbers,31,7,"So they made war against Midian, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses, and they killed every male."
Numbers,31,8,"They killed the kings of Midian along with the rest of their slain: Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian; they also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword."
Numbers,31,9,And the sons of Israel captured the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods they plundered.
Numbers,31,10,Then they burned all their cities where they lived and all their camps with fire.
Numbers,31,11,"And they took all the spoil and all the loot, both of man and of beast."
Numbers,31,12,"And they brought the captives and the loot and the spoil to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan opposite Jericho."
Numbers,31,13,And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the congregation went out to meet them outside the camp.
Numbers,31,14,"And Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, who had come from service in the war."
Numbers,31,15,"So Moses said to them, “Have you spared all the women?"
Numbers,31,16,"Behold, these caused the sons of Israel, through the word of Balaam, to act unfaithfully against Yahweh in the matter of Peor, so the plague was among the congregation of Yahweh."
Numbers,31,17,"So now, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man intimately."
Numbers,31,18,"But all the girls who have not known man intimately, spare for yourselves."
Numbers,31,19,"And you, camp outside the camp seven days; whoever has killed any person and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves, you and your captives, on the third day and on the seventh day."
Numbers,31,20,And you shall purify for yourselves every garment and every article of leather and all the work of goats’ hair and all articles of wood.”
Numbers,31,21,"Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to battle, “This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded Moses"
Numbers,31,22,"only the gold and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin and the lead"
Numbers,31,23,"everything that can stand the fire, you shall pass through the fire, and it shall be clean, but it shall be purified with water for impurity. But whatever cannot stand the fire you shall pass through the water."
Numbers,31,24,"And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you may enter the camp.”"
Numbers,31,25,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,31,26,"“You and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers’ households of the congregation take a count of the loot that was captured, both of man and of animal"
Numbers,31,27,and divide the loot between the warriors who went out to battle and all the congregation.
Numbers,31,28,"And you shall exact a levy for Yahweh from the men of war who went out to battle, one in five hundred of the persons and of the cattle and of the donkeys and of the sheep"
Numbers,31,29,"take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest, as a contribution to Yahweh."
Numbers,31,30,"And from the sons of Israel’s half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the sheep, from all the animals, and give them to the Levites who keep charge of the tabernacle of Yahweh.”"
Numbers,31,31,Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
Numbers,31,32,"Now the loot that remained from the plunder which the men of war had plundered was 675,000 sheep"
Numbers,31,33,"and 72,000 cattle"
Numbers,31,34,"and 61,000 donkeys"
Numbers,31,35,"and of human beings, of the women who had not known man intimately, all the persons were 32,000."
Numbers,31,36,"And the half, the portion of those who went out to war, was as follows: the number of sheep was 337,500"
Numbers,31,37,and the levy of Yahweh from the sheep was 675
Numbers,31,38,"and the cattle were 36,000, from which the levy of Yahweh was 72"
Numbers,31,39,"and the donkeys were 30,500, from which the levy of Yahweh was 61"
Numbers,31,40,"and the human beings were 16,000, from whom the levy of Yahweh was 32 persons."
Numbers,31,41,"And Moses gave the levy, which was the contribution to Yahweh, to Eleazar the priest, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses."
Numbers,31,42,"As for the sons of Israel’s half, which Moses separated from the men who had gone to war"
Numbers,31,43,"now the congregation’s half was 337,500 sheep"
Numbers,31,44,"and 36,000 cattle"
Numbers,31,45,"and 30,500 donkeys"
Numbers,31,46,"and the human beings were 16,000"
Numbers,31,47,"and from the sons of Israel’s half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animals, and gave them to the Levites, who kept the responsibility of the tabernacle of Yahweh, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses."
Numbers,31,48,"Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, came near to Moses"
Numbers,31,49,"and they said to Moses, “Your servants have taken a census of men of war who are in our charge, and no man of us is missing."
Numbers,31,50,"So we have brought near as an offering to Yahweh what each man found—articles of gold, armlets and bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves before Yahweh.”"
Numbers,31,51,"And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all kinds of crafted articles."
Numbers,31,52,"And all the gold from the contribution offering which they raised up in offering to Yahweh, from the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, was 16,750 shekels."
Numbers,31,53,"The men of war had taken plunder, every man for himself."
Numbers,31,54,"So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and they brought it to the tent of meeting as a memorial for the sons of Israel before Yahweh."
Numbers,32,1,"Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had an exceedingly large number of livestock. And they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, that it was indeed a place suitable for livestock"
Numbers,32,2,"so the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the congregation, saying"
Numbers,32,3,"“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon"
Numbers,32,4,"the land, which Yahweh struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock.”"
Numbers,32,5,"And they said, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants as a possession; do not take us across the Jordan.”"
Numbers,32,6,"But Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, “Shall your brothers go to war while you yourselves sit here?"
Numbers,32,7,Now why are you discouraging the sons of Israel from crossing over into the land which Yahweh has given them?
Numbers,32,8,This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
Numbers,32,9,"Indeed they went up to the valley of Eshcol and saw the land, and they discouraged the sons of Israel so that they did not go into the land which Yahweh had given them."
Numbers,32,10,"So Yahweh’s anger burned in that day, and He swore an oath, saying"
Numbers,32,11,"‘None of the men who came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; for they did not follow Me fully"
Numbers,32,12,"except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have followed Yahweh fully.’"
Numbers,32,13,"So Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the entire generation of those who had done evil in the sight of Yahweh was brought to an end."
Numbers,32,14,"Now behold, you have risen up in your fathers’ place, a brood of sinful men, to add still more to the burning anger of Yahweh against Israel."
Numbers,32,15,"For if you turn away from following Him, He will once more abandon them in the wilderness, and you will destroy all these people.”"
Numbers,32,16,"Then they came near to him and said, “We will build here sheepfolds for our livestock and cities for our little ones"
Numbers,32,17,"but we ourselves will be armed ready to go before the sons of Israel, until we have brought them to their place, and our little ones live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land."
Numbers,32,18,We will not return to our homes until every one of the sons of Israel has possessed his inheritance.
Numbers,32,19,For we will not have an inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond because our inheritance has fallen to us on this side of the Jordan east.”
Numbers,32,20,"So Moses said to them, “If you will do this, if you will arm yourselves before Yahweh for the war"
Numbers,32,21,and all of you armed men cross over the Jordan before Yahweh until He has dispossessed His enemies from before Him
Numbers,32,22,"and the land is subdued before Yahweh, then afterward you shall return and be free of obligation toward Yahweh and toward Israel, and this land shall be yours for a possession before Yahweh."
Numbers,32,23,"But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh, and be sure your sin will find you out."
Numbers,32,24,"Build yourselves cities for your little ones and sheepfolds for your sheep, and do what you have promised.”"
Numbers,32,25,"And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, “Your servants will do just as my lord commands."
Numbers,32,26,"Our little ones, our wives, our livestock, and all our cattle shall remain there in the cities of Gilead"
Numbers,32,27,"but your servants, everyone who is armed for war, will cross over in the presence of Yahweh to battle, just as my lord says.”"
Numbers,32,28,So Moses gave a command concerning them to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of the fathers’ households of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
Numbers,32,29,"And Moses said to them, “If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben, everyone who is armed for battle, will cross with you over the Jordan in the presence of Yahweh, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession"
Numbers,32,30,"but if they will not cross over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.”"
Numbers,32,31,"And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying, “As Yahweh has said to your servants, so we will do."
Numbers,32,32,"We ourselves will cross over armed in the presence of Yahweh into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us across the Jordan.”"
Numbers,32,33,"So Moses gave to them, to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben and to the half-tribe of Joseph’s son Manasseh, the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan, the land with its cities with their territories, the cities of the surrounding land."
Numbers,32,34,And the sons of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer
Numbers,32,35,and Atroth-shophan and Jazer and Jogbehah
Numbers,32,36,"and Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran as fortified cities, and sheepfolds for sheep."
Numbers,32,37,And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon and Elealeh and Kiriathaim
Numbers,32,38,"and Nebo and Baal-meon—their names being changed—and Sibmah, and they gave other names to the cities which they built."
Numbers,32,39,And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it.
Numbers,32,40,"So Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he lived in it."
Numbers,32,41,And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its towns and called them Havvoth-jair.
Numbers,32,42,And Nobah went and took Kenath and its towns and called it Nobah after his own name.
Numbers,33,1,"These are the journeys of the sons of Israel, by which they came out from the land of Egypt by their armies, by the hand of Moses and Aaron."
Numbers,33,2,"And Moses wrote down their starting places according to their journeys by the command of Yahweh, and these are their journeys according to their starting places."
Numbers,33,3,"They journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the next day after the Passover the sons of Israel started out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians"
Numbers,33,4,but the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn whom Yahweh had struck down among them. Yahweh had also executed judgments on their gods.
Numbers,33,5,¶Then the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses and camped in Succoth.
Numbers,33,6,"They journeyed from Succoth and camped in Etham, which is on the edge of the wilderness."
Numbers,33,7,"They journeyed from Etham and turned back to Pi-hahiroth, which faces Baal-zephon, and they camped before Migdol."
Numbers,33,8,They journeyed from before Hahiroth and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness; and they went three days’ journey in the wilderness of Etham and camped at Marah.
Numbers,33,9,"They journeyed from Marah and came to Elim; and in Elim there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there."
Numbers,33,10,They journeyed from Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
Numbers,33,11,They journeyed from the Red Sea and camped in the wilderness of Sin.
Numbers,33,12,They journeyed from the wilderness of Sin and camped at Dophkah.
Numbers,33,13,They journeyed from Dophkah and camped at Alush.
Numbers,33,14,They journeyed from Alush and camped at Rephidim; now it was there that the people had no water to drink.
Numbers,33,15,They journeyed from Rephidim and camped in the wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers,33,16,They journeyed from the wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah.
Numbers,33,17,¶They journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
Numbers,33,18,They journeyed from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah.
Numbers,33,19,They journeyed from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon-perez.
Numbers,33,20,They journeyed from Rimmon-perez and camped at Libnah.
Numbers,33,21,They journeyed from Libnah and camped at Rissah.
Numbers,33,22,They journeyed from Rissah and camped in Kehelathah.
Numbers,33,23,They journeyed from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher.
Numbers,33,24,They journeyed from Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah.
Numbers,33,25,They journeyed from Haradah and camped at Makheloth.
Numbers,33,26,They journeyed from Makheloth and camped at Tahath.
Numbers,33,27,They journeyed from Tahath and camped at Terah.
Numbers,33,28,They journeyed from Terah and camped at Mithkah.
Numbers,33,29,They journeyed from Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah.
Numbers,33,30,They journeyed from Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth.
Numbers,33,31,They journeyed from Moseroth and camped at Bene-jaakan.
Numbers,33,32,They journeyed from Bene-jaakan and camped at Hor-haggidgad.
Numbers,33,33,They journeyed from Hor-haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah.
Numbers,33,34,They journeyed from Jotbathah and camped at Abronah.
Numbers,33,35,They journeyed from Abronah and camped at Ezion-geber.
Numbers,33,36,"They journeyed from Ezion-geber and camped in the wilderness of Zin, that is, Kadesh."
Numbers,33,37,"They journeyed from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, at the edge of the land of Edom."
Numbers,33,38,"Then Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the command of Yahweh, and he died there in the fortieth year after the sons of Israel had come from the land of Egypt, on the first day in the fifth month."
Numbers,33,39,Now Aaron was 123 years old when he died on Mount Hor.
Numbers,33,40,"¶Now the Canaanite, the king of Arad who lived in the Negev in the land of Canaan, heard when the sons of Israel were coming."
Numbers,33,41,¶Then they journeyed from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
Numbers,33,42,They journeyed from Zalmonah and camped at Punon.
Numbers,33,43,They journeyed from Punon and camped at Oboth.
Numbers,33,44,"They journeyed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, at the border of Moab."
Numbers,33,45,They journeyed from Iyim and camped at Dibon-gad.
Numbers,33,46,They journeyed from Dibon-gad and camped at Almon-diblathaim.
Numbers,33,47,"They journeyed from Almon-diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo."
Numbers,33,48,They journeyed from the mountains of Abarim and camped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho.
Numbers,33,49,"They camped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab."
Numbers,33,50,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho, saying"
Numbers,33,51,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you cross over the Jordan into the land of Canaan"
Numbers,33,52,then you shall dispossess all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their carved stones and destroy all their molten images and demolish all their high places
Numbers,33,53,"and you shall take possession of the land and inhabit it, for I have given the land to you to possess it."
Numbers,33,54,"And you shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the larger you shall give a larger inheritance, and to the smaller you shall give a smaller inheritance. Wherever the lot falls to anyone, that shall be his. You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers."
Numbers,33,55,"But if you do not dispossess the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it will be that those whom you let remain of them will become as pricks in your eyes and as thorns in your sides, and they will trouble you in the land which you inhabit."
Numbers,33,56,"And it will be as I plan to do to them, so I will do to you.’ ”"
Numbers,34,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,34,2,"“Command the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you enter the land of Canaan, this is the land that shall fall to you as an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to its borders."
Numbers,34,3,"And your southern sector shall extend from the wilderness of Zin along the side of Edom, and your southern border shall extend from the end of the Salt Sea eastward."
Numbers,34,4,"Then your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim and continue to Zin, and its termination shall be to the south of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall reach Hazaraddar and continue to Azmon."
Numbers,34,5,"And the border shall turn from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and its termination shall be at the sea."
Numbers,34,6,"‘And as for the west border, you shall have the Great Sea, that is, its coastline; this shall be your west border."
Numbers,34,7,‘And this shall be your north border: you shall draw your border line from the Great Sea to Mount Hor.
Numbers,34,8,"You shall draw a line from Mount Hor to Lebo-hamath, and the termination of the border shall be at Zedad"
Numbers,34,9,"and the border shall proceed to Ziphron, and its termination shall be at Hazar-enan. This shall be your north border."
Numbers,34,10,‘For your east border you shall also draw a line from Hazar-enan to Shepham
Numbers,34,11,and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down and reach to the slope on the east side of the Sea of Chinnereth.
Numbers,34,12,"And the border shall go down to the Jordan, and its termination shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to its borders all around.’ ”"
Numbers,34,13,"So Moses commanded the sons of Israel, saying, “This is the land that you shall inherit by lot among you as a possession, which Yahweh has commanded to give to the nine and a half tribes."
Numbers,34,14,"For the tribe of the sons of Reuben have received theirs according to their fathers’ households, and the tribe of the sons of Gad according to their fathers’ households, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance."
Numbers,34,15,The two and a half tribes have received their inheritance across the Jordan opposite Jericho to the east toward the sunrise.”
Numbers,34,16,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,34,17,“These are the names of the men who shall apportion the land to you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun.
Numbers,34,18,And you shall take one leader of every tribe to apportion the land for inheritance.
Numbers,34,19,"Now these are the names of the men:
Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh."
Numbers,34,20,"Of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Samuel the son of Ammihud."
Numbers,34,21,"Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon."
Numbers,34,22,"Of the tribe of the sons of Dan a leader, Bukki the son of Jogli."
Numbers,34,23,"Of the sons of Joseph: of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh a leader, Hanniel the son of Ephod."
Numbers,34,24,"Of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim a leader, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan."
Numbers,34,25,"Of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun a leader, Elizaphan the son of Parnach."
Numbers,34,26,"Of the tribe of the sons of Issachar a leader, Paltiel the son of Azzan."
Numbers,34,27,"Of the tribe of the sons of Asher a leader, Ahihud the son of Shelomi."
Numbers,34,28,"Of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali a leader, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.”"
Numbers,34,29,These are those whom Yahweh commanded to apportion the inheritance to the sons of Israel in the land of Canaan.
Numbers,35,1,"Now Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho, saying"
Numbers,35,2,“Command the sons of Israel that they give to the Levites from the inheritance of their possession cities to live in; and you shall give to the Levites pasture lands around the cities.
Numbers,35,3,And the cities shall be theirs to live in; and their pasture lands shall be for their cattle and for their herds and for all their beasts.
Numbers,35,4,“And the pasture lands of the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall extend from the wall of the city outward one thousand cubits around.
Numbers,35,5,"You shall also measure outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits, with the city in the center. This shall become theirs as pasture lands for the cities."
Numbers,35,6,"And the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be the six cities of refuge, which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to; and in addition to them you shall give forty-two cities."
Numbers,35,7,"All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities, together with their pasture lands."
Numbers,35,8,"Now as for the cities which you shall give from the possession of the sons of Israel, you shall take more from the larger, and you shall take less from the smaller; each shall give some of his cities to the Levites in proportion to his possession which he inherits.”"
Numbers,35,9,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Numbers,35,10,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan"
Numbers,35,11,"then you shall select for yourselves cities to be your cities of refuge, that the manslayer who has struck down any person unintentionally may flee there."
Numbers,35,12,"And the cities shall be for you as a refuge from the avenger, so that the manslayer will not die until he stands before the congregation for judgment."
Numbers,35,13,And the cities which you are to give shall be your six cities of refuge.
Numbers,35,14,You shall give three cities across the Jordan and three cities in the land of Canaan; they are to be cities of refuge.
Numbers,35,15,These six cities shall be for refuge for the sons of Israel and for the sojourner and for the foreign resident among them; that anyone who strikes a person down unintentionally may flee there.
Numbers,35,16,"‘But if he struck him down with an iron object, so that he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,17,"And if he struck him down with a stone in the hand, by which he would die, and as a result he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,18,"Or if he struck him with a wooden object in the hand, by which he would die, and as a result he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,19,The blood avenger himself shall put the murderer to death; he shall put him to death when he meets him.
Numbers,35,20,And if he pushed him of hatred or threw something at him lying in wait and as a result he died
Numbers,35,21,"or if he struck him down with his hand in enmity, and as a result he died, the one who struck him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer; the blood avenger shall put the murderer to death when he meets him."
Numbers,35,22,‘But if he pushed him suddenly without enmity or threw something at him without lying in wait
Numbers,35,23,"or with any stone—by which one might die, yet without seeing—and it fell upon him, and he died, but he was not his enemy nor seeking his injury"
Numbers,35,24,then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the blood avenger according to these legal judgments.
Numbers,35,25,"And the congregation shall deliver the manslayer from the hand of the blood avenger, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge to which he fled; and he shall live in it until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil."
Numbers,35,26,But if the manslayer at any time goes beyond the border of his city of refuge to which he may flee
Numbers,35,27,"and the blood avenger finds him outside the border of his city of refuge, and the blood avenger kills the manslayer, he will not be guilty of blood"
Numbers,35,28,because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return to the land of his possession.
Numbers,35,29,‘And these things shall be for a statutory judgment to you throughout your generations in all your places of habitation.
Numbers,35,30,"‘If anyone strikes down a person, the murderer shall be put to death at the mouth of witnesses, but no person shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness."
Numbers,35,31,"Moreover, you shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death."
Numbers,35,32,"And you shall not take ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge, that he may return to live in the land before the death of the priest."
Numbers,35,33,"So you shall not pollute the land in which you are; for blood pollutes the land, and no propitiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of him who shed it."
Numbers,35,34,"And you shall not defile the land in which you live, in the midst of which I dwell; for I Yahweh am dwelling in the midst of the sons of Israel.’ ”"
Numbers,36,1,"And the heads of the fathers’ households of the family of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and before the leaders, the heads of the fathers’ households of the sons of Israel"
Numbers,36,2,"and they said, “Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land by lot to the sons of Israel as an inheritance, and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters."
Numbers,36,3,"But if they marry one of the sons of the other tribes of the sons of Israel, their inheritance will be withdrawn from the inheritance of our fathers and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; thus it will be withdrawn from our allotted inheritance."
Numbers,36,4,"And when the jubilee of the sons of Israel comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; so their inheritance will be withdrawn from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.”"
Numbers,36,5,"Then Moses commanded the sons of Israel according to the word of Yahweh, saying, “The tribe of the sons of Joseph are right in their statements."
Numbers,36,6,"This is what Yahweh has commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, ‘Let them marry whoever is good in their sight; only they must marry within the family of the tribe of their father.’"
Numbers,36,7,"Thus no inheritance of the sons of Israel shall be transferred from tribe to tribe, for the sons of Israel shall each hold to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers."
Numbers,36,8,"And every daughter who comes into possession of an inheritance of any tribe of the sons of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, so that the sons of Israel each may possess the inheritance of his fathers."
Numbers,36,9,"Thus no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another tribe, for the tribes of the sons of Israel shall each hold to his own inheritance.”"
Numbers,36,10,"Just as Yahweh had commanded Moses, so the daughters of Zelophehad did"
Numbers,36,11,"And Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad married their uncles’ sons."
Numbers,36,12,"They married those from the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained with the tribe of the family of their father."
Numbers,36,13,These are the commandments and the judgments which Yahweh commanded to the sons of Israel by the hand of Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho.
