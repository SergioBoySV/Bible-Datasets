Haggai,1,1,"In the second year of Darius the king, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of Yahweh came by the hand of Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying"
Haggai,1,2,"“Thus says Yahweh of hosts, ‘This people says, “The time has not come, even the time for the house of Yahweh to be rebuilt.” ’ ”"
Haggai,1,3,"Then the word of Yahweh came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying"
Haggai,1,4,“Is it time for you yourselves to live in your paneled houses while this house lies waste?”
Haggai,1,5,"So now, thus says Yahweh of hosts, “Set your heart to consider your ways!"
Haggai,1,6,"You have sown much, but bring in little; you eat, but there is not enough to be satisfied; you drink, but there is not enough to become drunk; you put on clothing, but no one is warm enough; and he who earns, earns wages to put into a bag with holes.”"
Haggai,1,7,"Thus says Yahweh of hosts, “Set your heart to consider your ways!"
Haggai,1,8,"Go up to the mountains and bring wood and rebuild the house of God, that I may be pleased with it and be glorified,” says Yahweh."
Haggai,1,9,"“You look for much, but behold, it comes to little; and you bring it home, and I blow it away. Why?” declares Yahweh of hosts, “Because of My house which lies waste, while each of you runs to his own house."
Haggai,1,10,"Therefore, because of you the sky has restrained its dew and the earth has restrained its produce."
Haggai,1,11,"And I called for a drought on the land, on the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on what the ground brings forth, on men, on cattle, and on all the labor of your hands.”"
Haggai,1,12,"Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, listened to the voice of Yahweh their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, as Yahweh their God had sent him. And the people feared Yahweh."
Haggai,1,13,"Then Haggai, the messenger of Yahweh, spoke by the commissioned message of Yahweh to the people saying, “ ‘I am with you,’ declares Yahweh.”"
Haggai,1,14,"So Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work on the house of Yahweh of hosts, their God"
Haggai,1,15,on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of Darius the king.
Haggai,2,1,"On the twenty-first of the seventh month, the word of Yahweh came by the hand of Haggai the prophet saying"
Haggai,2,2,"“Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people saying"
Haggai,2,3,‘Who among you remains who saw this house in its former glory? And how do you see it now? Does it not seem like nothing in your eyes?
Haggai,2,4,"But now, be strong, Zerubbabel,’ declares Yahweh, ‘be strong also, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all you people of the land, be strong,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and work; for I am with you,’ declares Yahweh of hosts."
Haggai,2,5,"‘As for the promise which I cut with you when you came out of Egypt, My Spirit is standing in your midst; do not fear!’"
Haggai,2,6,"For thus says Yahweh of hosts, ‘Once more—in a little while—I am going to shake the heavens and the earth, the sea also and the dry land."
Haggai,2,7,"And I will shake all the nations; and they will come with the desirable things of all nations, and I will fill this house with glory,’ says Yahweh of hosts."
Haggai,2,8,"‘The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine,’ declares Yahweh of hosts."
Haggai,2,9,"‘The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,’ says Yahweh of hosts, ‘and in this place I will give peace,’ declares Yahweh of hosts.”"
Haggai,2,10,"On the twenty-fourth of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Yahweh came to Haggai the prophet, saying"
Haggai,2,11,"“Thus says Yahweh of hosts, ‘Ask now the priests about the law"
Haggai,2,12,"If a man carries holy meat in the fold of his garment and touches bread with this fold or cooked food, wine, oil, or any other food, will it become holy?’ ” And the priests answered, “No.”"
Haggai,2,13,"Then Haggai said, “If one who is unclean from a corpse touches any of these, will the latter become unclean?” And the priests answered, “It will become unclean.”"
Haggai,2,14,"Then Haggai answered and said, “ ‘So is this people. And so is this nation before Me,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and so is every work of their hands; and what they bring near to Me there is unclean."
Haggai,2,15,"But now, oh set your heart to consider from this day onward: from before one stone was set on another in the temple of Yahweh"
Haggai,2,16,"from when it was that one came to a grain heap of twenty measures, then there would be only ten; and from when one came to the wine vat to draw fifty troughs full, then there would be only twenty."
Haggai,2,17,"I struck you and every work of your hands with scorching wind, mildew, and hail; yet you did not come back to Me,’ declares Yahweh."
Haggai,2,18,"‘Oh set your heart to consider from this day onward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month; from the day when the temple of Yahweh was founded, set your heart to consider"
Haggai,2,19,"Is the seed still in the barn? Even including the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree, it has not borne fruit. Yet from this day on I will bless you.’ ”"
Haggai,2,20,"Then the word of Yahweh came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying"
Haggai,2,21,"“Speak to Zerubbabel governor of Judah, saying, ‘I am going to shake the heavens and the earth."
Haggai,2,22,"I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots and their riders, and the horses and their riders will go down, everyone by the sword of another.’"
Haggai,2,23,"‘On that day,’ declares Yahweh of hosts, ‘I will take you, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, My servant,’ declares Yahweh, ‘and I will make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you,’ ” declares Yahweh of hosts."
