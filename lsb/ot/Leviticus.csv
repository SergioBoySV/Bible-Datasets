Leviticus,1,1,"Then Yahweh called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying"
Leviticus,1,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When any man from among you brings an offering near to Yahweh, you shall bring your offering of animals from the herd or the flock."
Leviticus,1,3,"If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall bring it near, a male without blemish; he shall bring it near to the doorway of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before Yahweh."
Leviticus,1,4,"And he shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, that it may be accepted for him to make atonement on his behalf."
Leviticus,1,5,Then he shall slaughter the young bull before Yahweh; and Aaron’s sons the priests shall bring near the blood and splash the blood around on the altar that is at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,1,6,And he shall then skin the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces.
Leviticus,1,7,And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire.
Leviticus,1,8,"Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, the head, and the suet over the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar."
Leviticus,1,9,"Its entrails, however, and its legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer up in smoke all of it on the altar for a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to Yahweh."
Leviticus,1,10,"‘But if his offering is from the flock, of the sheep or of the goats, for a burnt offering, he shall bring near a male without blemish."
Leviticus,1,11,"And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar northward before Yahweh, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall splash its blood around on the altar."
Leviticus,1,12,"He shall then cut it into its pieces with its head and its suet, and the priest shall arrange them on the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar."
Leviticus,1,13,"The entrails, however, and the legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall bring all of it near and offer it up in smoke on the altar; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to Yahweh."
Leviticus,1,14,"‘But if his offering to Yahweh is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall bring near his offering from the turtledoves or from young pigeons."
Leviticus,1,15,And the priest shall bring it near to the altar and wring off its head and offer it up in smoke on the altar; and its blood is to be drained out on the side of the altar.
Leviticus,1,16,"He shall also take away its crop with its feathers and cast it beside the altar eastward, to the place of the ashes."
Leviticus,1,17,"Then he shall tear it by its wings, but he shall not separate it. And the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar on the wood which is on the fire; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to Yahweh."
Leviticus,2,1,"‘Now when anyone brings near a grain offering as an offering to Yahweh, his offering shall be of fine flour, and he shall pour oil on it and put frankincense on it."
Leviticus,2,2,"He shall then bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; and he shall take from it his handful of its fine flour and of its oil with all of its frankincense. And the priest shall offer it up in smoke as its memorial portion on the altar, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to Yahweh."
Leviticus,2,3,And the remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons: a thing most holy of the offerings to Yahweh by fire.
Leviticus,2,4,"‘Now when you bring near an offering of a grain offering baked in an oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil or unleavened wafers spread with oil."
Leviticus,2,5,"And if your offering is a grain offering made on the griddle, it shall be of fine flour, unleavened, mixed with oil"
Leviticus,2,6,you shall break it into bits and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
Leviticus,2,7,"Now if your offering is a grain offering made in a pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil."
Leviticus,2,8,"And you will bring in the grain offering which is made of these things to Yahweh, and it shall be brought near to the priest, and he shall bring it to the altar."
Leviticus,2,9,"The priest then shall raise up from the grain offering its memorial portion, and he shall offer it up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to Yahweh."
Leviticus,2,10,And the remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons: a thing most holy of the offerings to Yahweh by fire.
Leviticus,2,11,"‘No grain offering, which you bring near to Yahweh, shall be made with leaven, for you shall not offer up in smoke any leaven or any honey as an offering by fire to Yahweh."
Leviticus,2,12,"As an offering of first fruits you shall bring them near to Yahweh, but they shall not ascend for a soothing aroma on the altar."
Leviticus,2,13,"Every grain offering of yours, moreover, you shall season with salt, so that the salt of the covenant of your God shall not be lacking from your grain offering; with all your offerings you shall bring salt near."
Leviticus,2,14,"‘Also if you bring near a grain offering of early ripened things to Yahweh, you shall bring near fresh heads of grain roasted in the fire, grits of new growth, for the grain offering of your early ripened things."
Leviticus,2,15,You shall then put oil on it and place frankincense on it; it is a grain offering.
Leviticus,2,16,"And the priest shall offer up in smoke its memorial portion, part of its grits and its oil with all its frankincense as an offering by fire to Yahweh."
Leviticus,3,1,"‘Now if his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings, if he is going to bring near one from the herd, whether male or female, he shall bring it near without blemish before Yahweh."
Leviticus,3,2,"Then he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter it at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall splash the blood around on the altar."
Leviticus,3,3,"From the sacrifice of the peace offerings he shall bring an offering by fire near to Yahweh, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails"
Leviticus,3,4,"and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys."
Leviticus,3,5,"Then Aaron’s sons shall offer it up in smoke on the altar on the burnt offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire; it is an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to Yahweh."
Leviticus,3,6,"But if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh is from the flock, he shall bring it near, male or female, without blemish."
Leviticus,3,7,"If he is going to bring near a lamb for his offering, then he shall bring it near before Yahweh"
Leviticus,3,8,"and he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter it before the tent of meeting, and Aaron’s sons shall splash its blood around on the altar."
Leviticus,3,9,"And from the sacrifice of peace offerings he shall bring near as an offering by fire to Yahweh its fat, the entire fat tail which he shall remove close to the backbone, and the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails"
Leviticus,3,10,"and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys."
Leviticus,3,11,"Then the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar as food, an offering by fire to Yahweh."
Leviticus,3,12,"‘Moreover, if his offering is a goat, then he shall bring it near before Yahweh"
Leviticus,3,13,"and he shall lay his hand on its head and slaughter it before the tent of meeting, and the sons of Aaron shall splash its blood around on the altar."
Leviticus,3,14,And from it he shall bring near his offering as an offering by fire to Yahweh the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails
Leviticus,3,15,"and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys."
Leviticus,3,16,"And the priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar as food, an offering by fire for a soothing aroma; all fat is Yahweh’s."
Leviticus,3,17,It is a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your places of habitation: you shall not eat any fat or any blood.’ ”
Leviticus,4,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,4,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘If a person sins unintentionally in any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and he does any one of them"
Leviticus,4,3,"if the anointed priest sins so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him bring near to Yahweh a bull from the herd without blemish as a sin offering for the sin he has committed."
Leviticus,4,4,"Then he shall bring the bull to the doorway of the tent of meeting before Yahweh, and he shall lay his hand on the head of the bull and slaughter the bull before Yahweh."
Leviticus,4,5,Then the anointed priest shall take some of the blood of the bull and bring it to the tent of meeting
Leviticus,4,6,and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before Yahweh in front of the veil of the sanctuary.
Leviticus,4,7,The priest shall also put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense which is before Yahweh in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering which is at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,4,8,Then he shall raise up from it all the fat of the bull of the sin offering: the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat which is on the entrails
Leviticus,4,9,"and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys"
Leviticus,4,10,"(just as it is raised up from the ox of the sacrifice of peace offerings), and the priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar of burnt offering."
Leviticus,4,11,But the hide of the bull and all its flesh with its head and its legs and its entrails and its refuse
Leviticus,4,12,"that is, all the rest of the bull, he shall bring out to a clean place outside the camp where the ashes are poured out, and he shall burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned."
Leviticus,4,13,"‘Now if the whole congregation of Israel commits error, and the matter is hidden from the sight of the assembly, and they commit any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and they become guilty"
Leviticus,4,14,"when the sin which they have committed becomes known, then the assembly shall bring near a bull from the herd for a sin offering and bring it before the tent of meeting."
Leviticus,4,15,"Then the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before Yahweh, and the bull shall be slaughtered before Yahweh."
Leviticus,4,16,Then the anointed priest shall bring some of the blood of the bull to the tent of meeting
Leviticus,4,17,and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before Yahweh in front of the veil.
Leviticus,4,18,And he shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before Yahweh in the tent of meeting; and all the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering which is at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,4,19,He shall then raise up all its fat from it and offer it up in smoke on the altar.
Leviticus,4,20,"He shall also do with the bull just as he did with the bull of the sin offering; thus he shall do with it. So the priest shall make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven."
Leviticus,4,21,Then he shall bring out the bull to a place outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the assembly.
Leviticus,4,22,"‘When a leader sins and unintentionally does any one of all the things which Yahweh his God has commanded not to be done, and he becomes guilty"
Leviticus,4,23,"or if his sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a male without blemish."
Leviticus,4,24,Then he shall lay his hand on the head of the male goat and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before Yahweh; it is a sin offering.
Leviticus,4,25,Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering.
Leviticus,4,26,"And all its fat he shall offer up in smoke on the altar as in the case of the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him in regard to his sin, and he will be forgiven."
Leviticus,4,27,"‘Now if anyone of the common people sins unintentionally in doing any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and becomes guilty"
Leviticus,4,28,"or if his sin which he has committed is made known to him, then he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has committed."
Leviticus,4,29,And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter the sin offering at the place of the burnt offering.
Leviticus,4,30,And the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and all the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar.
Leviticus,4,31,"Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat was removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar for a soothing aroma to Yahweh. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven."
Leviticus,4,32,"‘But if he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring it, a female without blemish."
Leviticus,4,33,And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it for a sin offering in the place where they slay the burnt offering.
Leviticus,4,34,"And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and all the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar."
Leviticus,4,35,"Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of the peace offerings, and the priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar, on the offerings by fire to Yahweh. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him in regard to his sin which he has committed, and he will be forgiven."
Leviticus,5,1,"‘Now if a person sins after he hears a public oath to testify when he is a witness, whether he has seen or otherwise known, if he does not tell it, then he will bear his guilt."
Leviticus,5,2,"Or a person who touches any unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean beast or the carcass of unclean cattle or a carcass of unclean swarming things—though it is hidden from him, yet he is unclean—will be guilty."
Leviticus,5,3,"Or if he touches human uncleanness, of whatever sort his uncleanness may be with which he becomes unclean, and it is hidden from him, and then he comes to know it, he will be guilty."
Leviticus,5,4,"Or if a person swears thoughtlessly with his lips to do evil or to do good, in whatever matter a man may speak thoughtlessly with a sworn oath, and it is hidden from him, and then he comes to know it, he will be guilty in one of these."
Leviticus,5,5,"So it shall be, when he becomes guilty in one of these, that he shall confess that in which he has sinned."
Leviticus,5,6,"He shall also bring his guilt offering to Yahweh for his sin which he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, as a sin offering. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin."
Leviticus,5,7,"‘But if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring to Yahweh his guilt offering for that in which he has sinned, two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering."
Leviticus,5,8,"And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall bring near first that which is for the sin offering and shall nip its head at the front of its neck, but he shall not separate it."
Leviticus,5,9,"He shall also sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,10,"The second he shall then prepare as a burnt offering according to the legal judgment. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin which he has committed, and it will be forgiven him."
Leviticus,5,11,"‘But if his means are insufficient for two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then for his offering for that which he has sinned, he shall bring the tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall not place oil on it or put frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,12,"He shall then bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as its memorial portion and offer it up in smoke on the altar, with the offerings of Yahweh by fire: it is a sin offering."
Leviticus,5,13,"So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin which he has committed from one of these, and it will be forgiven him; then the rest shall become the priest’s, like the grain offering.’ ”"
Leviticus,5,14,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,5,15,"“If a person acts unfaithfully and sins unintentionally against the holy things of Yahweh, then he shall bring his guilt offering to Yahweh: a ram without blemish from the flock, according to your valuation in silver by shekels, in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary, for a guilt offering."
Leviticus,5,16,"And he shall make restitution for that which he has sinned against the holy thing, and he shall add to it a fifth part of it and give it to the priest. The priest shall then make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and it will be forgiven him."
Leviticus,5,17,"“Now if a person sins and does any one of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, but he was unaware, still he is guilty and shall bear his punishment."
Leviticus,5,18,"He is then to bring to the priest a ram without blemish from the flock, according to your valuation, for a guilt offering. So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his error in which he sinned unintentionally and did not know it, and it will be forgiven him."
Leviticus,5,19,It is a guilt offering; he was certainly guilty before Yahweh.”
Leviticus,6,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,6,2,"“If a person sins and acts unfaithfully against Yahweh and deals falsely with his companion in regard to a deposit or a security entrusted to him or through robbery, or if he has extorted from his companion"
Leviticus,6,3,"or has found what was lost and dealt falsely about it and sworn falsely, so that he sins in regard to any one of the things a man may do"
Leviticus,6,4,"then it shall be, when he sins and becomes guilty, that he shall return what he took by robbery or what he got by extortion, or the deposit which was entrusted to him or the lost thing which he found"
Leviticus,6,5,or anything about which he swore falsely; he shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more. He shall give it to the one to whom it belongs on the day he presents his guilt offering.
Leviticus,6,6,"Then he shall bring to the priest his guilt offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish from the flock, according to your valuation, for a guilt offering"
Leviticus,6,7,"and the priest shall make atonement for him before Yahweh, and he will be forgiven for any one of the things which he may have done to incur guilt.”"
Leviticus,6,8,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,6,9,"“Command Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the law for the burnt offering: the burnt offering itself shall remain on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning, and the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it."
Leviticus,6,10,"And the priest shall put on his linen robe, and he shall put on undergarments next to his flesh; and he shall raise up the ashes to which the fire reduces the burnt offering on the altar and place them beside the altar."
Leviticus,6,11,Then he shall take off his garments and put on other garments and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
Leviticus,6,12,"And the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it. It shall not go out, but the priest shall burn wood on it every morning; and he shall lay out the burnt offering on it and offer up in smoke the fat portions of the peace offerings on it."
Leviticus,6,13,Fire shall be kept burning continually on the altar; it shall not go out.
Leviticus,6,14,‘Now this is the law of the grain offering: the sons of Aaron shall bring it near before Yahweh in front of the altar.
Leviticus,6,15,"Then one of them shall raise up from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering, with its oil and all the frankincense that is on the grain offering, and he shall offer it up in smoke on the altar, a soothing aroma, as its memorial offering to Yahweh."
Leviticus,6,16,What is left of it Aaron and his sons shall eat. It shall be eaten as unleavened cakes in a holy place; they shall eat it in the court of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,6,17,"It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their share from My offerings by fire; it is most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering."
Leviticus,6,18,"Every male among the sons of Aaron may eat it; it is a perpetual statute throughout your generations, from the offerings by fire to Yahweh. Whoever touches them will be set apart as holy.’ ”"
Leviticus,6,19,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,6,20,"“This is the offering which Aaron and his sons shall bring near to Yahweh on the day when he is anointed; the tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening."
Leviticus,6,21,"It shall be prepared with oil on a griddle. When it is well stirred, you shall bring it. You shall bring near the grain offering in baked pieces as a soothing aroma to Yahweh."
Leviticus,6,22,"And the anointed priest, who will be in his place among his sons, shall offer it. By a perpetual statute it shall be entirely offered up in smoke to Yahweh."
Leviticus,6,23,So every grain offering of the priest shall be burned entirely. It shall not be eaten.”
Leviticus,6,24,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,6,25,"“Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the sin offering: in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, the sin offering shall be slaughtered before Yahweh; it is most holy."
Leviticus,6,26,"The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place, in the court of the tent of meeting."
Leviticus,6,27,"Anyone who touches its flesh will be set apart as holy; and when any of its blood sprinkles on a garment, in a holy place you shall wash what was sprinkled on."
Leviticus,6,28,"Also the earthenware vessel in which it was boiled shall be broken; and if it was boiled in a bronze vessel, then it shall be scoured and rinsed in water."
Leviticus,6,29,And every male among the priests may eat of it; it is most holy.
Leviticus,6,30,"But no sin offering, of which any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten; it shall be burned with fire."
Leviticus,7,1,‘Now this is the law of the guilt offering; it is most holy.
Leviticus,7,2,"In the place where they slaughter the burnt offering they are to slaughter the guilt offering, and he shall splash its blood around on the altar."
Leviticus,7,3,Then he shall bring near from it all its fat: the fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails
Leviticus,7,4,"and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, which is on the loins, and the lobe on the liver he shall remove with the kidneys."
Leviticus,7,5,And the priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire to Yahweh; it is a guilt offering.
Leviticus,7,6,Every male among the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy.
Leviticus,7,7,"The guilt offering is like the sin offering, there is one law for them; the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it."
Leviticus,7,8,"Also the priest who brings near any man’s burnt offering, that priest shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has brought near."
Leviticus,7,9,"Likewise, every grain offering that is baked in the oven and everything prepared in a pan or on a griddle shall belong to the priest who brings it near."
Leviticus,7,10,"And every grain offering, mixed with oil or dry, shall belong to all the sons of Aaron, to all alike."
Leviticus,7,11,‘Now this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which shall be brought near to Yahweh.
Leviticus,7,12,"If he brings it near for thanksgiving, then along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving he shall bring near unleavened cakes mixed with oil and unleavened wafers spread with oil and cakes of well stirred fine flour mixed with oil."
Leviticus,7,13,"With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving, he shall bring near his offering with cakes of leavened bread."
Leviticus,7,14,"Of this he shall bring near, one of every offering as a contribution to Yahweh; it shall belong to the priest who splashes the blood of the peace offerings."
Leviticus,7,15,"‘Now as for the flesh of the sacrifice of his thanksgiving peace offerings, it shall be eaten on the day of his offering; he shall not leave any of it over until morning."
Leviticus,7,16,"But if the sacrifice of his offering is a votive or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he brings near his sacrifice, and on the next day what is left of it may be eaten"
Leviticus,7,17,but what is left over from the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire.
Leviticus,7,18,"So if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings should ever be eaten on the third day, he who brings it near will not be accepted, and it will not be counted to his benefit. It shall be an offensive thing, and the person who eats of it will bear his own iniquity."
Leviticus,7,19,"‘Also the flesh that touches anything unclean shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. As for other flesh, anyone who is clean may eat such flesh."
Leviticus,7,20,"But the person who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to Yahweh, in his uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,7,21,"When anyone touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness or an unclean animal or any unclean detestable thing, and eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to Yahweh, that person shall be cut off from his people.’ ”"
Leviticus,7,22,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,7,23,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘You shall not eat any fat from an ox, a sheep, or a goat."
Leviticus,7,24,"Also the fat of an animal which dies and the fat of an animal torn by beasts may be put to any other use, but you must certainly not eat it."
Leviticus,7,25,"For whoever eats the fat of the animal from which an offering by fire is brought near to Yahweh, even the person who eats shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,7,26,"And you shall not eat any blood, either of bird or animal, in any of your places of habitation."
Leviticus,7,27,"Any person who eats any blood, even that person shall be cut off from his people.’ ”"
Leviticus,7,28,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,7,29,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘He who brings the sacrifice of his peace offerings near to Yahweh shall bring his offering to Yahweh from the sacrifice of his peace offerings."
Leviticus,7,30,"His own hands are to bring offerings by fire to Yahweh. He shall bring the fat with the breast, that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before Yahweh."
Leviticus,7,31,"And the priest shall offer up the fat in smoke on the altar, but the breast shall belong to Aaron and his sons."
Leviticus,7,32,And you shall give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
Leviticus,7,33,"The one among the sons of Aaron who brings near the blood of the peace offerings and the fat, the right thigh shall be his as his portion."
Leviticus,7,34,"For I have taken the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution from the sons of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and I have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as a perpetual statute taken from the sons of Israel."
Leviticus,7,35,"‘This is the share for Aaron and the share for his sons from the offerings by fire to Yahweh, in that day when he brought them near to minister as priests to Yahweh."
Leviticus,7,36,These Yahweh had commanded to be given them from the sons of Israel in the day that He anointed them. It is a perpetual statute throughout their generations.’ ”
Leviticus,7,37,"This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering and the ordination offering and the sacrifice of peace offerings"
Leviticus,7,38,which Yahweh commanded Moses at Mount Sinai in the day that He commanded the sons of Israel to bring their offerings near to Yahweh in the wilderness of Sinai.
Leviticus,8,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,8,2,"“Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread"
Leviticus,8,3,and assemble all the congregation at the doorway of the tent of meeting.”
Leviticus,8,4,So Moses did just as Yahweh commanded him. Then the congregation was assembled at the doorway of the tent of meeting
Leviticus,8,5,"and Moses said to the congregation, “This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded to do.”"
Leviticus,8,6,Then Moses had Aaron and his sons come near and washed them with water.
Leviticus,8,7,"And he put the tunic on him and girded him with the sash and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him; and he girded him with the skillfully woven band of the ephod, with which he tied it to him."
Leviticus,8,8,"He then placed the breastpiece on him, and in the breastpiece he put the Urim and the Thummim."
Leviticus,8,9,"He also placed the turban on his head, and on the turban, at its front, he placed the golden plate, the holy crown, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,10,Moses then took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it and set them apart as holy.
Leviticus,8,11,"And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its utensils and the laver and its stand, to set them apart as holy."
Leviticus,8,12,"Then he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him, to set him apart as holy."
Leviticus,8,13,"Next Moses brought Aaron’s sons near and clothed them with tunics and girded them with sashes and bound caps on them, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,14,"Then he brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering."
Leviticus,8,15,"Next Moses slaughtered it and took the blood and with his finger put some of it around on the horns of the altar and purified the altar. Then he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar and set it apart as holy, to make atonement for it."
Leviticus,8,16,"He also took all the fat that was on the entrails, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat; and Moses offered it up in smoke on the altar."
Leviticus,8,17,"But the bull and its hide and its flesh and its refuse he burned in the fire outside the camp, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,18,"Then he brought near the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram."
Leviticus,8,19,Then Moses slaughtered it and splashed the blood around on the altar.
Leviticus,8,20,And he cut the ram into its pieces. Then Moses offered up the head and the pieces and the suet in smoke.
Leviticus,8,21,"And he washed the entrails and the legs with water. Then Moses offered up the whole ram in smoke on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a soothing aroma; it was an offering by fire to Yahweh, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,22,"Then he brought near the second ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram."
Leviticus,8,23,And Moses slaughtered it and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
Leviticus,8,24,He also brought Aaron’s sons near; and Moses put some of the blood on the lobe of their right ear and on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot. Moses then splashed the rest of the blood around on the altar.
Leviticus,8,25,"And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on the entrails, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh."
Leviticus,8,26,"From the basket of unleavened bread that was before Yahweh, he took one unleavened cake and one cake of bread mixed with oil and one wafer, and he placed them on the portions of fat and on the right thigh."
Leviticus,8,27,"He then put all these on the hands of Aaron and on the hands of his sons, and waved them as a wave offering before Yahweh."
Leviticus,8,28,Then Moses took them from their hands and offered them up in smoke on the altar with the burnt offering. They were an ordination offering for a soothing aroma; it was an offering by fire to Yahweh.
Leviticus,8,29,"Moses also took the breast and waved it as a wave offering before Yahweh; it was Moses’ portion of the ram of ordination, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,8,30,"So Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him; and he set Aaron apart as holy, his garments and his sons and the garments of his sons with him."
Leviticus,8,31,"Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the flesh at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and eat it there together with the bread which is in the basket of the ordination offering, just as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’"
Leviticus,8,32,And the remainder of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn in the fire.
Leviticus,8,33,"And you shall not go outside the doorway of the tent of meeting for seven days, until the day that the period of your ordination is fulfilled; for he will ordain you through seven days."
Leviticus,8,34,"Yahweh has commanded to do as has been done this day, to make atonement on your behalf."
Leviticus,8,35,"At the doorway of the tent of meeting, moreover, you shall remain day and night for seven days and keep the charge of Yahweh, so that you will not die, for so I have been commanded.”"
Leviticus,8,36,Thus Aaron and his sons did all the things which Yahweh had commanded through Moses.
Leviticus,9,1,Now it happened on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel
Leviticus,9,2,"and he said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a calf, a bull, for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and bring them near before Yahweh."
Leviticus,9,3,"Then to the sons of Israel you shall speak, saying, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both one year old, without blemish, for a burnt offering"
Leviticus,9,4,"and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh, and a grain offering mixed with oil; for today Yahweh will appear to you.’ ”"
Leviticus,9,5,"So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the whole congregation came near and stood before Yahweh."
Leviticus,9,6,"And Moses said, “This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded you to do, that the glory of Yahweh may appear to you.”"
Leviticus,9,7,"Moses then said to Aaron, “Come near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, that you may make atonement for yourself and for the people; then offer the offering for the people, that you may make atonement for them, just as Yahweh has commanded.”"
Leviticus,9,8,So Aaron came near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering which was for himself.
Leviticus,9,9,Then Aaron’s sons brought the blood near to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood and put some on the horns of the altar and poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
Leviticus,9,10,The fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver of the sin offering he then offered up in smoke on the altar just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
Leviticus,9,11,"The flesh and the skin, however, he burned with fire outside the camp."
Leviticus,9,12,"Then he slaughtered the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him, and he splashed it around on the altar."
Leviticus,9,13,"And they handed the burnt offering to him in pieces, with the head, and he offered them up in smoke on the altar."
Leviticus,9,14,He also washed the entrails and the legs and offered them up in smoke with the burnt offering on the altar.
Leviticus,9,15,"Then he brought near the people’s offering and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people and slaughtered it and offered it for sin, like the first."
Leviticus,9,16,He also brought near the burnt offering and offered it according to the legal judgment.
Leviticus,9,17,"Next he brought near the grain offering and filled his hand with some of it and offered it up in smoke on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning."
Leviticus,9,18,"Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him, and he splashed it around on the altar."
Leviticus,9,19,"As for the portions of fat from the ox and from the ram, the fat tail and the fat covering and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver"
Leviticus,9,20,they now placed the portions of fat on the breasts; and he offered them up in smoke on the altar.
Leviticus,9,21,"But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved as a wave offering before Yahweh, just as Moses had commanded."
Leviticus,9,22,"Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he stepped down after offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings."
Leviticus,9,23,And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting. Then they came out and blessed the people. And the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the people.
Leviticus,9,24,Then fire came out from before Yahweh and consumed the burnt offering and the portions of fat on the altar. And all the people saw it and shouted and fell on their faces.
Leviticus,10,1,"Then Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took their respective firepans and put fire in them. Then they placed incense on it and offered strange fire before Yahweh, which He had not commanded them."
Leviticus,10,2,"And fire came out from the presence of Yahweh and consumed them, and they died before Yahweh."
Leviticus,10,3,"Then Moses said to Aaron, “It is what Yahweh spoke, saying,
‘By those who come near Me I will be treated as holy,
And before all the people I will be glorified.’ ”
So Aaron kept silent."
Leviticus,10,4,"Then Moses called to Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come near, carry your relatives away from the front of the sanctuary to the outside of the camp.”"
Leviticus,10,5,"So they came near and carried them still in their tunics to the outside of the camp, as Moses had said."
Leviticus,10,6,"Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not uncover your heads nor tear your clothes, so that you will not die and that He will not become wrathful against all the congregation. But your relatives, the whole house of Israel, shall weep over the burning which Yahweh has brought about."
Leviticus,10,7,"You shall not even go out from the doorway of the tent of meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of Yahweh is upon you.” So they did according to the word of Moses."
Leviticus,10,8,"Yahweh then spoke to Aaron, saying"
Leviticus,10,9,"“Do not drink wine or strong drink, neither you nor your sons with you, when you come into the tent of meeting, so that you will not die—it is a perpetual statute throughout your generations"
Leviticus,10,10,"and so as to separate between the holy and the profane, and between the unclean and the clean"
Leviticus,10,11,and so as to instruct the sons of Israel in all the statutes which Yahweh has spoken to them through Moses.”
Leviticus,10,12,"Then Moses spoke to Aaron and to his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the remaining grain offering from the offerings to Yahweh by fire and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy."
Leviticus,10,13,And you shall eat it in a holy place because it is a statute for you and a statute for your sons taken out of the offerings of Yahweh by fire; for thus I have been commanded.
Leviticus,10,14,"The breast of the wave offering, however, and the thigh of the contribution offering you may eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you; for they have been given as a statute for you and a statute for your sons taken out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the sons of Israel."
Leviticus,10,15,"The thigh contributed by raising up and the breast offered by waving they shall bring along with the offerings by fire of the portions of fat, to wave as a wave offering before Yahweh; so it shall be a perpetual statute for you and your sons with you, just as Yahweh has commanded.”"
Leviticus,10,16,"But Moses searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned up! So he was angry with Aaron’s remaining sons Eleazar and Ithamar, saying"
Leviticus,10,17,"“Why did you not eat the sin offering at the holy place? For it is most holy, and He gave it to you to bear away the guilt of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Yahweh."
Leviticus,10,18,"Behold, since its blood had not been brought inside, into the sanctuary, you should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, just as I commanded.”"
Leviticus,10,19,"But Aaron spoke to Moses, “Behold, this very day they brought near their sin offering and their burnt offering before Yahweh. Then things like these happened to me. So if I had eaten a sin offering today, would it have been good in the sight of Yahweh?”"
Leviticus,10,20,"So Moses heard this, and it was good in his sight."
Leviticus,11,1,"Yahweh spoke again to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them"
Leviticus,11,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘These are the creatures which you may eat from all the animals that are on the earth."
Leviticus,11,3,"Whatever divides a hoof, thus making split hoofs, and chews the cud, among the animals, that you may eat."
Leviticus,11,4,"Nevertheless, you shall not eat of these, among those which chew the cud or among those which divide the hoof: the camel, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof; it is unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,5,"Likewise, the shaphan, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof; it is unclean to you"
Leviticus,11,6,"the rabbit also, for though it chews cud, it does not divide the hoof; it is unclean to you"
Leviticus,11,7,"and the pig, for though it divides the hoof, thus making a split hoof, it does not chew cud; it is unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,8,"You shall not eat of their flesh, and you shall not touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,9,"‘These you may eat, whatever is in the water: all that have fins and scales, those in the water, in the seas, or in the rivers, you may eat."
Leviticus,11,10,"But whatever is in the seas and in the rivers that does not have fins and scales among all the swarming life of the water, and among all the living creatures that are in the water, they are detestable things to you"
Leviticus,11,11,"and they shall be detestable to you; you may not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses you shall detest."
Leviticus,11,12,Whatever in the water does not have fins and scales is detestable to you.
Leviticus,11,13,"‘These, moreover, you shall detest among the birds; they shall not be eaten; they are detestable: the eagle and the vulture and the buzzard"
Leviticus,11,14,and the kite and the falcon in its kind
Leviticus,11,15,every raven in its kind
Leviticus,11,16,and the ostrich and the owl and the gull and the hawk in its kind
Leviticus,11,17,and the little owl and the cormorant and the great owl
Leviticus,11,18,and the white owl and the pelican and the carrion vulture
Leviticus,11,19,"and the stork, the heron in its kinds, and the hoopoe, and the bat."
Leviticus,11,20,‘All the swarming things that fly and that walk on all fours are detestable to you.
Leviticus,11,21,Yet these you may eat among all the swarming things that fly and that walk on all fours: those which have above their feet jointed legs with which to jump on the earth.
Leviticus,11,22,These of them you may eat: the locust in its kinds and the devastating locust in its kinds and the cricket in its kinds and the grasshopper in its kinds.
Leviticus,11,23,But all other swarming things that fly and that are four-footed are detestable to you.
Leviticus,11,24,"‘By these, moreover, you will be made unclean: whoever touches their carcasses becomes unclean until evening"
Leviticus,11,25,and whoever picks up any of their carcasses shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,11,26,"Concerning all the animals which divide the hoof but do not make a split hoof or which do not chew cud, they are unclean to you: whoever touches them becomes unclean."
Leviticus,11,27,"Also whatever walks on its paws, among all the creatures that walk on all fours, are unclean to you; whoever touches their carcasses becomes unclean until evening"
Leviticus,11,28,and the one who picks up their carcasses shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening; they are unclean to you.
Leviticus,11,29,‘Now these are to you the unclean among the swarming things which swarm on the earth: the mole and the mouse and the great lizard in its kinds
Leviticus,11,30,and the gecko and the crocodile and the lizard and the sand reptile and the chameleon.
Leviticus,11,31,These are to you the unclean among all the swarming things; whoever touches them when they are dead becomes unclean until evening.
Leviticus,11,32,"Also anything on which one of them may fall when they are dead becomes unclean, including any wooden article or clothing or a skin or a sack—any article by which work is done—it shall be put in the water and be unclean until evening, then it becomes clean."
Leviticus,11,33,"As for any earthenware vessel into which one of them may fall, whatever is in it becomes unclean, and you shall break the vessel."
Leviticus,11,34,"Any of the food which may be eaten, on which water comes, shall become unclean, and any liquid which may be drunk in every vessel shall become unclean."
Leviticus,11,35,"Everything, moreover, on which part of their carcass may fall becomes unclean; an oven or a stove shall be smashed; they are unclean and shall continue as unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,36,"Nevertheless a spring or a cistern collecting water shall be clean, though the one who touches their carcass shall be unclean."
Leviticus,11,37,"And if a part of their carcass falls on any seed for sowing which is to be sown, it is clean."
Leviticus,11,38,"Though if water is put on the seed and a part of their carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you."
Leviticus,11,39,"‘Also if one of the animals dies which you have for food, the one who touches its carcass becomes unclean until evening."
Leviticus,11,40,"He too, who eats some of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening, and the one who picks up its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,11,41,‘Now every swarming thing that swarms on the earth is detestable; it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus,11,42,"Whatever goes on its belly, and whatever goes on all fours, whatever has many feet, in respect to every swarming thing that swarms on the earth, you shall not eat them, for they are detestable."
Leviticus,11,43,Do not render yourselves detestable through any of the swarming things that swarm; and you shall not make yourselves unclean with them so that you become unclean.
Leviticus,11,44,"For I am Yahweh your God. Therefore, set yourselves apart as holy and be holy, for I am holy. And you shall not make yourselves unclean with any of the swarming things that move on the earth."
Leviticus,11,45,"For I am Yahweh who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God; thus you shall be holy, for I am holy.’ ”"
Leviticus,11,46,This is the law regarding the animal and the bird and every living thing that moves in the waters and everything that swarms on the earth
Leviticus,11,47,"to separate between the unclean and the clean, and between the edible creature and the creature which is not to be eaten."
Leviticus,12,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,12,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying:
‘ W hen a woman gives birth and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean for seven days, as in the days of her menstruation she shall be unclean."
Leviticus,12,3,Now on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
Leviticus,12,4,Then she shall remain in the blood of her cleansing for thirty-three days; she shall not touch any holy thing; and she shall not enter the sanctuary until the days of her cleansing are fulfilled.
Leviticus,12,5,"But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean for two weeks, as in her menstruation; and she shall remain in the blood of her cleansing for sixty-six days."
Leviticus,12,6,"‘When the days of her cleansing are fulfilled, for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the doorway of the tent of meeting a one year old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering."
Leviticus,12,7,"Then he shall bring it near before Yahweh and make atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who bears a child, whether a male or a female."
Leviticus,12,8,"But if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, the one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she will be clean.’ ”"
Leviticus,13,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying"
Leviticus,13,2,"“When a man has on the skin of his body a swelling or a scab or a bright spot, and it becomes an infection of leprosy on the skin of his body, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests."
Leviticus,13,3,"Then the priest shall look at the mark on the skin of the body, and if the hair in the infection has turned white and the infection appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is an infection of leprosy; when the priest has looked at him, he shall pronounce him unclean."
Leviticus,13,4,"But if the bright spot is white on the skin of his body, and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair on it has not turned white, then the priest shall isolate him who has the infection for seven days."
Leviticus,13,5,"Then the priest shall look at him on the seventh day, and if in his eyes the infection has not changed and the infection has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall isolate him for seven more days."
Leviticus,13,6,"And the priest shall look at him again on the seventh day, and if the infection has faded and the mark has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only a scab. And he shall wash his clothes and be clean."
Leviticus,13,7,"“But if the scab spreads farther on the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall appear again to the priest."
Leviticus,13,8,"And the priest shall look, and if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy."
Leviticus,13,9,"“When the infection of leprosy is on a man, then he shall be brought to the priest."
Leviticus,13,10,"The priest shall then look, and if there is a white swelling in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh still alive in the swelling"
Leviticus,13,11,"it is a chronic leprosy on the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not isolate him, for he is unclean."
Leviticus,13,12,"But if the leprosy breaks out farther on the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of him who has the infection from his head even to his feet, as far as the priest can see"
Leviticus,13,13,"then the priest shall look, and behold, if the leprosy has covered all his body, he shall pronounce clean him who has the infection; it has all turned white, and he is clean."
Leviticus,13,14,"But whenever raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean."
Leviticus,13,15,"And the priest shall look at the raw flesh, and he shall pronounce him unclean; the raw flesh is unclean; it is leprosy."
Leviticus,13,16,"Or if the raw flesh turns again and is changed to white, then he shall come to the priest"
Leviticus,13,17,"and the priest shall look at him, and behold, if the infection has turned to white, then the priest shall pronounce clean him who has the infection; he is clean."
Leviticus,13,18,“When the body has a boil on its skin and it is healed
Leviticus,13,19,"and in the place of the boil there is a white swelling or a reddish-white bright spot, then it shall be shown to the priest"
Leviticus,13,20,"and the priest shall look, and behold, if it appears to be lower than the skin, and the hair on it has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the infection of leprosy; it has broken out in the boil."
Leviticus,13,21,"But if the priest looks at it, and behold, there are no white hairs in it, and it is not lower than the skin and is faded, then the priest shall isolate him for seven days"
Leviticus,13,22,"and if it spreads farther on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection."
Leviticus,13,23,"But if the bright spot remains in its place and does not spread, it is only the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean."
Leviticus,13,24,"“Or if the body sustains in its skin a burn by fire, and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a bright spot, reddish-white, or white"
Leviticus,13,25,"then the priest shall look at it. And if the hair in the bright spot has turned white and it appears to be deeper than the skin, it is leprosy; it has broken out in the burn. Therefore, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection of leprosy."
Leviticus,13,26,"But if the priest looks at it, and behold, there is no white hair in the bright spot, and it is no deeper than the skin but is faded, then the priest shall isolate him for seven days"
Leviticus,13,27,"and the priest shall look at him on the seventh day. If it spreads farther in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an infection of leprosy."
Leviticus,13,28,"But if the bright spot remains in its place and has not spread in the skin but is faded, it is the swelling from the burn; and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is only the scar of the burn."
Leviticus,13,29,“Now if a man or woman has an infection on the head or on the beard
Leviticus,13,30,"then the priest shall look at the infection, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin, and there is thin yellowish hair in it, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a scale; it is leprosy of the head or of the beard."
Leviticus,13,31,"But if the priest looks at the infection of the scale, and behold, it appears to be no deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall isolate the person with the scaly infection for seven days."
Leviticus,13,32,"Now on the seventh day the priest shall look at the infection, and if the scale has not spread, and there is no yellowish hair in it, and the appearance of the scale is no deeper than the skin"
Leviticus,13,33,"then he shall shave himself, but he shall not shave the scale; and the priest shall isolate the person with the scale seven more days."
Leviticus,13,34,"Then on the seventh day the priest shall look at the scale, and if the scale has not spread in the skin and it appears to be no deeper than the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his clothes and be clean."
Leviticus,13,35,But if the scale spreads farther in the skin after his cleansing
Leviticus,13,36,"then the priest shall look at him, and if the scale has spread in the skin, the priest need not seek for the yellowish hair; he is unclean."
Leviticus,13,37,"If in his sight the scale has remained, however, and black hair has grown in it, the scale has healed, he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean."
Leviticus,13,38,"“When a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of the body, even white bright spots"
Leviticus,13,39,"then the priest shall look, and if the bright spots on the skin of their bodies are a faded white, it is eczema that has broken out on the skin; he is clean."
Leviticus,13,40,"“Now if a man loses the hair of his head, he is bald; he is clean."
Leviticus,13,41,"And if his head becomes bald at the front and sides, he is bald on the forehead; he is clean."
Leviticus,13,42,"But if on the bald head or the bald forehead, there occurs a reddish-white infection, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or on his bald forehead."
Leviticus,13,43,"Then the priest shall look at him; and if the swelling of the infection is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the body"
Leviticus,13,44,he is a leprous man; he is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his infection is on his head.
Leviticus,13,45,"“As for the leper who has the infection, his clothes shall be torn, and the hair of his head shall be uncovered, and he shall cover his mustache and call out, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’"
Leviticus,13,46,He shall remain unclean all the days during which he has the infection; he is unclean. He shall live alone; his place of habitation shall be outside the camp.
Leviticus,13,47,"“When a garment has a mark of leprosy in it, whether it is a wool garment or a linen garment"
Leviticus,13,48,"whether in warp or woof, of linen or of wool, whether in leather or in any article made of leather"
Leviticus,13,49,"if the mark is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of leather, it is a leprous mark and shall be shown to the priest."
Leviticus,13,50,Then the priest shall look at the mark and shall isolate the article with the mark for seven days.
Leviticus,13,51,"He shall then look at the mark on the seventh day; if the mark has spread in the garment, whether in the warp or in the woof or in the leather, whatever the purpose for which the leather is used, the mark is a leprous malignancy; it is unclean."
Leviticus,13,52,"So he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in wool or in linen, or any article of leather in which the mark occurs, for it is a leprous malignancy; it shall be burned in the fire."
Leviticus,13,53,"“But if the priest shall look, and indeed the mark has not spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof or in any article of leather"
Leviticus,13,54,"then the priest shall command them to wash the thing in which the mark occurs, and he shall isolate it for seven more days."
Leviticus,13,55,"After the article with the mark has been washed, the priest shall again look, and if the mark has not changed its appearance, even though the mark has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire, whether an eating away has produced bareness on the top or on the front of it."
Leviticus,13,56,"“Then if the priest looks, and if the mark has faded after it has been washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment or out of the leather, whether from the warp or from the woof"
Leviticus,13,57,"and if it appears again in the garment, whether in the warp or in the woof or in any article of leather, it is an outbreak; you shall burn the article with the mark in the fire."
Leviticus,13,58,"Now the garment, whether the warp or the woof or any article of leather from which the mark has departed when you washed it, shall then be washed a second time and will be clean.”"
Leviticus,13,59,"This is the law for the mark of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen, whether in the warp or in the woof or in any article of leather, for pronouncing it clean or unclean."
Leviticus,14,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,14,2,“This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing. Now he shall be brought to the priest
Leviticus,14,3,"and the priest shall go out to the outside of the camp. Thus the priest shall look, and if the infection of leprosy has been healed in the leper"
Leviticus,14,4,then the priest shall give a command to take two live clean birds and cedar wood and a scarlet string and hyssop for the one who is to be cleansed.
Leviticus,14,5,The priest shall also give a command to slaughter the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running water.
Leviticus,14,6,"As for the live bird, he shall take it together with the cedar wood and the scarlet string and the hyssop, and he shall dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird that was slaughtered over the running water."
Leviticus,14,7,"He shall then sprinkle seven times the one who is to be cleansed from the leprosy and shall pronounce him clean, and he shall let the live bird go free over the open field."
Leviticus,14,8,"The one to be cleansed shall then wash his clothes and shave off all his hair and bathe in water and be clean. Now afterward, he may enter the camp, but he shall stay outside his tent for seven days."
Leviticus,14,9,"And it will be on the seventh day that he shall shave off all his hair: he shall shave his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair. He shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in water and be clean."
Leviticus,14,10,"“Now on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish, and a yearling ewe lamb without blemish, and three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and one log of oil"
Leviticus,14,11,and the priest who pronounces him clean shall present the man to be cleansed as well as these things before Yahweh at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,14,12,"Then the priest shall take the one male lamb and bring it near for a guilt offering, with the log of oil, and wave them as a wave offering before Yahweh."
Leviticus,14,13,"Next he shall slaughter the male lamb in the place where they slaughter the sin offering and the burnt offering, at the place of the sanctuary—for the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most holy."
Leviticus,14,14,"The priest shall then take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot."
Leviticus,14,15,The priest shall also take some of the log of oil and pour it into his left palm
Leviticus,14,16,"the priest shall then dip his right-hand finger into the oil that is in his left palm, and with his finger sprinkle some of the oil seven times before Yahweh."
Leviticus,14,17,"Of the remaining oil which is in his palm, the priest shall put some on the right ear lobe of the one to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot, on the blood of the guilt offering"
Leviticus,14,18,"but the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s palm, he shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf before Yahweh."
Leviticus,14,19,"The priest shall next offer the sin offering and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from his uncleanness. Then afterward, he shall slaughter the burnt offering."
Leviticus,14,20,"And the priest shall offer up the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he will be clean."
Leviticus,14,21,"“But if he is poor and his means are insufficient, then he is to take one male lamb for a guilt offering as a wave offering to make atonement for him, and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and a log of oil"
Leviticus,14,22,"and two turtledoves or two young pigeons which are within his means, the one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering."
Leviticus,14,23,"Then the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the priest, at the doorway of the tent of meeting, before Yahweh."
Leviticus,14,24,"And the priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before Yahweh."
Leviticus,14,25,Next he shall slaughter the lamb of the guilt offering; and the priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
Leviticus,14,26,The priest shall also pour some of the oil into his left palm
Leviticus,14,27,and with his right-hand finger the priest shall sprinkle some of the oil that is in his left palm seven times before Yahweh.
Leviticus,14,28,"The priest shall then put some of the oil that is in his palm on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the guilt offering."
Leviticus,14,29,"Moreover, the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s palm he shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement on his behalf before Yahweh."
Leviticus,14,30,"He shall then offer one of the turtledoves or young pigeons, which are within his means."
Leviticus,14,31,"He shall offer what he can afford, the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, together with the grain offering. So the priest shall make atonement before Yahweh on behalf of the one to be cleansed."
Leviticus,14,32,"This is the law for him in whom there is an infection of leprosy, whose means are limited for his cleansing.”"
Leviticus,14,33,"Yahweh further spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying"
Leviticus,14,34,"“When you enter the land of Canaan, which I am giving you for a possession, and I put a mark of leprosy on a house in the land of your possession"
Leviticus,14,35,"then the one who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, ‘Something like a mark of leprosy has become visible to me in the house.’"
Leviticus,14,36,"The priest shall then command that they empty the house before the priest goes in to look at the mark, so that everything in the house need not become unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to look at the house."
Leviticus,14,37,"So he shall look at the mark, and if the mark on the walls of the house has greenish or reddish depressions and appears deeper than the surface of the wall"
Leviticus,14,38,"then the priest shall come out of the house, to the doorway, and put the house under isolation for seven days."
Leviticus,14,39,And the priest shall return on the seventh day and look again. If the mark has indeed spread in the walls of the house
Leviticus,14,40,then the priest shall command them to tear out the stones with the mark in them and throw them away at an unclean place outside the city.
Leviticus,14,41,"And he shall have the house scraped all around inside, and they shall pour out the plaster that they scrape off at an unclean place outside the city."
Leviticus,14,42,"Then they shall take other stones and replace those stones, and he shall take other plaster and replaster the house."
Leviticus,14,43,"“If, however, the mark breaks out again in the house after he has torn out the stones and scraped the house, and after it has been replastered"
Leviticus,14,44,"then the priest shall come in and look again. If he sees that the mark has indeed spread in the house, it is a leprous malignancy in the house; it is unclean."
Leviticus,14,45,"He shall therefore tear down the house, its stones and its timbers and all the plaster of the house, and he shall take them outside the city to an unclean place."
Leviticus,14,46,"Moreover, whoever goes into the house during the time that he has put it under isolation becomes unclean until evening."
Leviticus,14,47,"Likewise, whoever lies down in the house shall wash his clothes, and whoever eats in the house shall wash his clothes."
Leviticus,14,48,"“If, on the other hand, the priest comes in and looks again, and the mark has not indeed spread in the house after the house has been replastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean because the mark has not reappeared."
Leviticus,14,49,"To cleanse the house then, he shall take two birds and cedar wood and a scarlet string and hyssop"
Leviticus,14,50,and he shall slaughter the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running water.
Leviticus,14,51,"Then he shall take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet string, with the live bird, and he shall dip them in the blood of the slaughtered bird as well as in the running water, and he shall sprinkle the house seven times."
Leviticus,14,52,"He shall thus cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and with the running water, along with the live bird and with the cedar wood and with the hyssop and with the scarlet string."
Leviticus,14,53,"However, he shall let the live bird go free outside the city into the open field. So he shall make atonement for the house, and it will be clean.”"
Leviticus,14,54,This is the law for any mark of leprosy—even for a scale
Leviticus,14,55,and for the leprous garment or house
Leviticus,14,56,and for a swelling and for a scab and for a bright spot
Leviticus,14,57,to instruct when they are unclean and when they are clean. This is the law of leprosy.
Leviticus,15,1,"Yahweh also spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying"
Leviticus,15,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When any man has a discharge from his body, his discharge is unclean."
Leviticus,15,3,"This, moreover, shall be his uncleanness in his discharge: it is his uncleanness whether his body allows its discharge to flow or whether his body obstructs its discharge."
Leviticus,15,4,"Every bed on which the person with the discharge lies becomes unclean, and everything on which he sits becomes unclean."
Leviticus,15,5,"Anyone, moreover, who touches his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening"
Leviticus,15,6,and whoever sits on the thing on which the man with the discharge has been sitting shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,7,Also whoever touches the person with the discharge shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,8,"Or if the man with the discharge spits on one who is clean, he too shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,9,Every saddle on which the person with the discharge rides becomes unclean.
Leviticus,15,10,"Whoever then touches any of the things which were under him shall be unclean until evening, and he who carries them shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,11,"Likewise, whomever the one with the discharge touches without having rinsed his hands in water shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,12,"However, an earthenware vessel which the person with the discharge touches shall be broken, and every wooden vessel shall be rinsed in water."
Leviticus,15,13,"‘Now when the man with the discharge becomes cleansed from his discharge, then he shall count off for himself seven days for his cleansing; he shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in running water and will become clean."
Leviticus,15,14,Then on the eighth day he shall take for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons and come before Yahweh to the doorway of the tent of meeting and give them to the priest
Leviticus,15,15,"and the priest shall offer them, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf before Yahweh because of his discharge."
Leviticus,15,16,"‘Now if a man has a seminal emission, he shall bathe all his body in water and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,17,"As for any garment or any leather on which there is seminal emission, it shall be washed with water and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,18,"If there is a woman with whom a man lies so that there is a seminal emission, they shall both bathe in water and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,19,"‘If a woman has a discharge, and her discharge in her body is blood, she shall continue in her menstrual impurity for seven days; and whoever touches her shall be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,20,"Everything also on which she lies during her menstrual impurity shall be unclean, and everything on which she sits shall be unclean."
Leviticus,15,21,And anyone who touches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,22,And whoever touches any thing on which she sits shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening.
Leviticus,15,23,"Whether it be on the bed or on the thing on which she is sitting, when he touches it, he shall be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,24,"If a man actually lies with her so that her menstrual impurity is on him, he shall be unclean seven days, and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean."
Leviticus,15,25,"‘Now if a woman has a discharge of her blood many days, not at the period of her menstrual impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond that period, all the days of her unclean discharge she shall continue as though in her menstrual impurity; she is unclean."
Leviticus,15,26,"Any bed on which she lies all the days of her discharge shall be to her like her bed at menstruation; and every thing on which she sits shall be unclean, like her uncleanness from her menstrual impurity."
Leviticus,15,27,"Likewise, whoever touches them shall be unclean and shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until evening."
Leviticus,15,28,"Now if she becomes clean from her discharge, she shall count off for herself seven days; and afterward she will be clean."
Leviticus,15,29,"Then on the eighth day she shall take for herself two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them in to the priest, to the doorway of the tent of meeting."
Leviticus,15,30,And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. So the priest shall make atonement on her behalf before Yahweh because of her unclean discharge.’
Leviticus,15,31,"“Thus you shall keep the sons of Israel separated from their uncleanness, so that they will not die in their uncleanness by making My tabernacle that is among them unclean.”"
Leviticus,15,32,"This is the law for the one with a discharge, and for the man who has a seminal emission so that he is unclean by it"
Leviticus,15,33,"and for the woman who is ill because of menstrual impurity, and for the one who has a discharge, whether a male or a female, or a man who lies with an unclean woman."
Leviticus,16,1,"Now Yahweh spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they came near the presence of Yahweh and died."
Leviticus,16,2,"And Yahweh said to Moses:
“ T ell your brother Aaron that he shall not enter at any time into the holy place inside the veil, before the mercy seat which is on the ark, so that he will not die; for I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat."
Leviticus,16,3,Aaron shall enter the holy place with this: with a bull from the herd for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,16,4,"He shall put on the holy linen tunic, and the linen undergarments shall be next to his body, and he shall be girded with the linen sash and attired with the linen turban (these are holy garments). Then he shall bathe his body in water and put them on."
Leviticus,16,5,And he shall take from the congregation of the sons of Israel two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus,16,6,"Then Aaron shall bring near the bull for the sin offering which is for himself, that he may make atonement for himself and for his household."
Leviticus,16,7,And he shall take the two goats and present them before Yahweh at the doorway of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus,16,8,"And Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats, one lot for Yahweh and the other lot for the scapegoat."
Leviticus,16,9,"Then Aaron shall bring near the goat on which the lot for Yahweh fell, and he shall offer it as a sin offering."
Leviticus,16,10,"But the goat on which the lot for the scapegoat fell shall be presented alive before Yahweh, to make atonement upon it, to send it out into the wilderness as the scapegoat."
Leviticus,16,11,"“Then Aaron shall bring near the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his household, and he shall slaughter the bull of the sin offering which is for himself."
Leviticus,16,12,"And he shall take a firepan full of coals of fire from upon the altar before Yahweh and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense, and bring it inside the veil."
Leviticus,16,13,"And he shall put the incense on the fire before Yahweh, that the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the ark of the testimony, so that he will not die."
Leviticus,16,14,"Moreover, he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat on the east side; also in front of the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times."
Leviticus,16,15,“Then he shall slaughter the goat of the sin offering which is for the people and bring its blood inside the veil and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull. And he shall sprinkle it on the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat.
Leviticus,16,16,So he shall make atonement for the holy place because of the uncleanness of the sons of Israel and because of their transgressions in regard to all their sins; and thus he shall do for the tent of meeting which abides with them in the midst of their uncleanness.
Leviticus,16,17,"Now when he goes in to make atonement in the holy place, no one shall be in the tent of meeting until he comes out, that he may make atonement for himself and for his household and for all the assembly of Israel."
Leviticus,16,18,"Then he shall go out to the altar that is before Yahweh and make atonement for it. And he shall take some of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar on all sides."
Leviticus,16,19,With his finger he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it seven times and cleanse it and set it apart as holy from the uncleanness of the sons of Israel.
Leviticus,16,20,"“And when he finishes making atonement for the holy place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall bring near the live goat."
Leviticus,16,21,"Then Aaron shall lay both of his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the iniquities of the sons of Israel and all their transgressions in regard to all their sins; and he shall lay them on the head of the goat and send it out into the wilderness by the hand of a man ready to do this."
Leviticus,16,22,And the goat shall bear on itself all their iniquities to an isolated land; and he shall send out the goat in the wilderness.
Leviticus,16,23,“Then Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting and take off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the holy place and shall leave them there.
Leviticus,16,24,"And he shall bathe his body with water in a holy place and put on his clothes and come forth, and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people and make atonement for himself and for the people."
Leviticus,16,25,Then he shall offer up in smoke the fat of the sin offering on the altar.
Leviticus,16,26,And the one who sent the goat out as the scapegoat shall wash his clothes and bathe his body with water; then afterward he shall come into the camp.
Leviticus,16,27,"But the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be taken outside the camp, and they shall burn their hides, their flesh, and their refuse in the fire."
Leviticus,16,28,"Then the one who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body with water, and afterward he shall come into the camp."
Leviticus,16,29,"“And this shall be a perpetual statute for you: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall humble your souls and not do any work, whether the native or the sojourner who sojourns among you"
Leviticus,16,30,for it is on this day that atonement shall be made for you to cleanse you; you will be clean from all your sins before Yahweh.
Leviticus,16,31,"It is to be a sabbath of solemn rest for you, that you may humble your souls; it is a perpetual statute."
Leviticus,16,32,"So the priest who is anointed and ordained to minister as a priest in his father’s place shall make atonement: he shall thus put on the linen garments, the holy garments"
Leviticus,16,33,"and make atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar. He shall also make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly."
Leviticus,16,34,"Now you shall have this as a perpetual statute, to make atonement for the sons of Israel for all their sins once every year.” And just as Yahweh had commanded Moses, so he did."
Leviticus,17,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,17,2,"“Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘This is what Yahweh has commanded, saying"
Leviticus,17,3,"“Any man from the house of Israel who slaughters an ox or a lamb or a goat in the camp, or who slaughters it outside the camp"
Leviticus,17,4,"and has not brought it to the doorway of the tent of meeting to bring it near as an offering to Yahweh before the tabernacle of Yahweh, it will be counted as bloodguiltiness to that man. He has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people."
Leviticus,17,5,"The reason is so that the sons of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they were sacrificing in the open field, that they may bring them in to Yahweh, at the doorway of the tent of meeting to the priest, and sacrifice them as sacrifices of peace offerings to Yahweh."
Leviticus,17,6,And the priest shall splash the blood on the altar of Yahweh at the doorway of the tent of meeting and offer up the fat in smoke as a soothing aroma to Yahweh.
Leviticus,17,7,And they shall no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat demons with which they play the harlot. This shall be a perpetual statute to them throughout their generations.” ’
Leviticus,17,8,"“Then you shall say to them, ‘Any man from the house of Israel, or from the sojourners who sojourn among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice"
Leviticus,17,9,"and does not bring it to the doorway of the tent of meeting to offer it to Yahweh, that man also shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,17,10,"‘And any man from the house of Israel, or from the sojourners who sojourn among them, who eats any blood, I will set My face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off from among his people."
Leviticus,17,11,"For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement by the life.’"
Leviticus,17,12,"Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, ‘No person among you may eat blood, and no sojourner who sojourns among you may eat blood.’"
Leviticus,17,13,"So any man from the sons of Israel, or from the sojourners who sojourn among them, who in hunting catches a beast or a bird which may be eaten, shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth."
Leviticus,17,14,"“For as for the life of all flesh, its blood is identified with its life. Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, ‘You are not to eat the blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats it shall be cut off.’"
Leviticus,17,15,"And when any person eats an animal which dies or is torn by beasts, whether he is a native or a sojourner, he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and remain unclean until evening; then he will become clean."
Leviticus,17,16,"But if he does not wash them or bathe his body, then he shall bear his guilt.”"
Leviticus,18,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,18,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘I am Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,18,3,"You shall not do according to what is done in the land of Egypt where you lived, nor are you to do according to what is done in the land of Canaan where I am bringing you; you shall not walk in their statutes."
Leviticus,18,4,"You are to do My judgments and keep My statutes, to walk in them; I am Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,18,5,"So you shall keep My statutes and My judgments, which if a man does them, he shall live by them; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,18,6,‘None of you shall approach any blood relative of his to uncover nakedness; I am Yahweh.
Leviticus,18,7,"You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, that is, the nakedness of your mother. She is your mother; you are not to uncover her nakedness."
Leviticus,18,8,You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife; it is your father’s nakedness.
Leviticus,18,9,"The nakedness of your sister, either your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, whether born at home or born outside, their nakedness you shall not uncover."
Leviticus,18,10,"The nakedness of your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter, their nakedness you shall not uncover; for their nakedness is yours."
Leviticus,18,11,"The nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter, born to your father, she is your sister; you shall not uncover her nakedness."
Leviticus,18,12,You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister; she is your father’s blood relative.
Leviticus,18,13,"You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister, for she is your mother’s blood relative."
Leviticus,18,14,You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s brother; you shall not approach his wife; she is your aunt.
Leviticus,18,15,You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son’s wife; you shall not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus,18,16,You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother’s wife; it is your brother’s nakedness.
Leviticus,18,17,"You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and of her daughter, nor shall you take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are blood relatives. It is lewdness."
Leviticus,18,18,"And you shall not marry a woman in addition to her sister as a rival while she is alive, to uncover her nakedness."
Leviticus,18,19,‘Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her menstrual impurity.
Leviticus,18,20,"And you shall not lie sexually with your neighbor’s wife, to be defiled with her."
Leviticus,18,21,"And you shall not give any of your seed to pass them over to Molech, nor shall you profane the name of your God; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,18,22,And you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.
Leviticus,18,23,"Also you shall not lie with any animal to be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it; it is a perversion."
Leviticus,18,24,‘So do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled.
Leviticus,18,25,"So the land has become defiled, and I have brought its punishment upon it. And the land has vomited out its inhabitants."
Leviticus,18,26,"But as for you, you shall keep My statutes and My judgments and shall not do any of these abominations, neither the native nor the sojourner who sojourns among you"
Leviticus,18,27,"(for the men of the land who have been before you have done all these abominations, and the land has become defiled)"
Leviticus,18,28,"so that the land will not vomit you out, should you defile it, as it has vomited out the nation which has been before you."
Leviticus,18,29,"For whoever does any of these abominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their people."
Leviticus,18,30,"Thus you are to keep My charge, that you do not do any of the abominable statutes which have been done before you, so as not to defile yourselves with them; I am Yahweh your God.’ ”"
Leviticus,19,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,19,2,"“Speak to all the congregation of the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘You shall be holy, for I, Yahweh your God, am holy."
Leviticus,19,3,"Every one of you shall fear his mother and his father, and you shall keep My sabbaths; I am Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,19,4,Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves molten gods; I am Yahweh your God.
Leviticus,19,5,"‘Now when you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh, you shall offer it so that you may be accepted."
Leviticus,19,6,It shall be eaten the same day you offer it and the next day; but what remains until the third day shall be burned with fire.
Leviticus,19,7,"So if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an offense; it will not be accepted."
Leviticus,19,8,"And everyone who eats it will bear his iniquity, for he has profaned the holy thing of Yahweh; and that person shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,19,9,"‘Now when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the very corners of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest."
Leviticus,19,10,"Nor shall you glean your vineyard, nor shall you gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the afflicted and for the sojourner. I am Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,19,11,"‘You shall not steal, nor deal falsely, nor lie to one another."
Leviticus,19,12,"And you shall not swear falsely by My name, so as to profane the name of your God; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,19,13,‘You shall not oppress your neighbor nor rob him. The wages of a hired man shall not remain with you overnight until morning.
Leviticus,19,14,"You shall not curse a deaf man nor place a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall fear your God; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,19,15,"‘You shall do no injustice in judgment; you shall not be partial to the poor nor defer to the great, but you shall judge your neighbor in righteousness."
Leviticus,19,16,"You shall not go about as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not stand against the life of your neighbor; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,19,17,"‘You shall not hate your brother in your heart; you may surely reprove your neighbor, and so not bear sin because of him."
Leviticus,19,18,"You shall not take vengeance, and you shall not keep your anger against the sons of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,19,19,‘You are to keep My statutes. You shall not breed together two kinds of your cattle; you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed nor wear a garment upon you of two kinds of material mixed together.
Leviticus,19,20,"‘Now if a man lies sexually with a woman who is a slave assigned to another man, but who has in no way been redeemed nor given her freedom, there shall be punishment; they shall not, however, be put to death because she was not free."
Leviticus,19,21,"And he shall bring his guilt offering to Yahweh to the doorway of the tent of meeting, a ram for a guilt offering."
Leviticus,19,22,"The priest shall also make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before Yahweh for his sin which he has committed, and the sin which he has committed will be forgiven him."
Leviticus,19,23,"‘When you enter the land and plant all kinds of trees for food, then you shall designate their fruit as forbidden. Three years it shall be forbidden to you; it shall not be eaten."
Leviticus,19,24,"But in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy, an offering of praise to Yahweh."
Leviticus,19,25,"Now in the fifth year you shall eat of its fruit, that its produce may increase for you; I am Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,19,26,‘You shall not eat anything with the blood nor interpret omens or soothsaying.
Leviticus,19,27,You shall not round off the side-growth of your heads nor harm the edges of your beard.
Leviticus,19,28,And you shall not make any cuts in your body for the dead nor make any tattoo marks on yourselves: I am Yahweh.
Leviticus,19,29,"‘Do not profane your daughter by making her a harlot, so that the land will not fall to harlotry and the land become full of lewdness."
Leviticus,19,30,You shall keep My sabbaths and fear My sanctuary; I am Yahweh.
Leviticus,19,31,‘Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them. I am Yahweh your God.
Leviticus,19,32,"‘You shall rise up before the gray-haired and honor the aged, and you shall fear your God; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,19,33,"‘And when a sojourner sojourns with you in your land, you shall not mistreat him."
Leviticus,19,34,"The sojourner who sojourns with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt; I am Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,19,35,"‘You shall do no wrong in judgment, in measurement of weight, or in volume."
Leviticus,19,36,"You shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin; I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt."
Leviticus,19,37,You shall thus keep all My statutes and all My judgments and do them; I am Yahweh.’ ”
Leviticus,20,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,20,2,"“You shall also say to the sons of Israel:
‘ A ny man from the sons of Israel or from the sojourners sojourning in Israel who gives any of his seed to Molech shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones."
Leviticus,20,3,"I will also set My face against that man and will cut him off from among his people because he has given some of those who are his seed to Molech, so as to defile My sanctuary and to profane My holy name."
Leviticus,20,4,"If the people of the land, however, should ever turn a blind eye to that man when he gives any of those who are his seed to Molech, so as not to put him to death"
Leviticus,20,5,"then I Myself will set My face against that man and against his family, and I will cut off from among their people both him and all those who play the harlot after him, in playing the harlot after Molech."
Leviticus,20,6,"‘As for the person who turns to mediums and to spiritists, to play the harlot after them, I will also set My face against that person and will cut him off from among his people."
Leviticus,20,7,"Therefore, you shall set yourselves apart as holy and be holy, for I am Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,20,8,And you shall keep My statutes and do them; I am Yahweh who makes you holy.
Leviticus,20,9,"‘If there is anyone who curses his father or his mother, he shall surely be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother. His bloodguiltiness is upon him."
Leviticus,20,10,"‘If there is a man who commits adultery with another man’s wife, one who commits adultery with his friend’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death."
Leviticus,20,11,"If there is a man who lies with his father’s wife, he has uncovered his father’s nakedness; both of them shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them."
Leviticus,20,12,"If there is a man who lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death; they have committed perversion. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them."
Leviticus,20,13,"If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them."
Leviticus,20,14,"If there is a man who marries a woman and her mother, it is lewdness; both he and they shall be burned with fire so that there will be no lewdness in your midst."
Leviticus,20,15,"If there is a man who lies with an animal, he shall surely be put to death; you shall also kill the animal."
Leviticus,20,16,"If there is a woman who approaches any animal to mate with it, you shall kill the woman and the animal; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them."
Leviticus,20,17,"‘If there is a man who takes his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter, so that he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness, it is a disgrace; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the sons of their people. He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he bears his guilt."
Leviticus,20,18,"If there is a man who lies with a menstruous woman and uncovers her nakedness, he has laid bare her flow, and she has uncovered the flow of her blood; thus both of them shall be cut off from among their people."
Leviticus,20,19,"You shall also not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister or of your father’s sister, for such a one has made naked his blood relative; they will bear their guilt."
Leviticus,20,20,"If there is a man who lies with his aunt, he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness; they will bear their sin. They will die childless."
Leviticus,20,21,"If there is a man who takes his brother’s wife, it is an impure act; he has uncovered his brother’s nakedness. They will be childless."
Leviticus,20,22,"‘You shall therefore keep all My statutes and all My judgments and do them, so that the land to which I am bringing you to inhabit will not vomit you out."
Leviticus,20,23,"Moreover, you shall not walk in the statutes of the nation which I will cast out before you, for they did all these things, and therefore I have loathed them."
Leviticus,20,24,"Hence I have said to you, “You yourselves shall possess their land, and I Myself will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey.” I am Yahweh your God, who has separated you from the peoples."
Leviticus,20,25,"You are therefore to separate between the clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean; and you shall not make yourselves detestable by animal or by bird or by anything that creeps on the ground, which I have separated for you as unclean."
Leviticus,20,26,"Thus you shall be holy to Me, for I Yahweh am holy; and I have separated you from the peoples to be Mine."
Leviticus,20,27,‘Now a man or a woman who is a medium or a spiritist shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them.’ ”
Leviticus,21,1,"Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them:
‘ N o one shall defile himself for a dead person among his people"
Leviticus,21,2,"except for his blood relatives who are nearest to him, his mother and his father and his son and his daughter and his brother"
Leviticus,21,3,"also for his virgin sister, who is near to him because she has had no husband; for her he may defile himself."
Leviticus,21,4,"He shall not defile himself as a relative by marriage among his people, and so profane himself."
Leviticus,21,5,They shall not make any baldness on their heads nor shave off the edges of their beards nor make any cuts in their flesh.
Leviticus,21,6,"They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God, for they bring near the offerings to Yahweh by fire, the food of their God; so they shall be holy."
Leviticus,21,7,"They shall not take a woman who is profaned by harlotry, nor shall they take a woman divorced from her husband; for he is holy to his God."
Leviticus,21,8,"Therefore, you shall set him apart as holy, for he brings near the food of your God; he shall be holy to you; for I Yahweh, who makes you holy, am holy."
Leviticus,21,9,"Also the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by harlotry, she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire."
Leviticus,21,10,"‘And the priest who is the highest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil has been poured and who has been ordained to wear the garments, shall not uncover his head nor tear his clothes"
Leviticus,21,11,nor shall he approach any dead person nor defile himself even for his father or his mother
Leviticus,21,12,"nor shall he go out of the sanctuary nor profane the sanctuary of his God, for the dedication of the anointing oil of his God is on him; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,21,13,And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
Leviticus,21,14,"A widow or a divorced woman or one who is profaned by harlotry, these he may not take; but rather he shall take a virgin of his own people as a wife"
Leviticus,21,15,so that he will not profane his seed among his people; for I am Yahweh who makes him holy.’ ”
Leviticus,21,16,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,21,17,"“Speak to Aaron, saying, ‘No man of your seed throughout their generations who has a defect shall come near to offer the food of his God."
Leviticus,21,18,For no one who has a defect shall come near: a blind man or a lame man or he who has a disfigured face or any deformed limb
Leviticus,21,19,or a man who has a broken foot or broken hand
Leviticus,21,20,"or a hunchback or a dwarf, or one who has a defect in his eye or eczema or scabs or crushed testicles."
Leviticus,21,21,"No man among the seed of Aaron the priest who has a defect shall approach to bring near the offerings to Yahweh by fire; since he has a defect, he shall not approach to bring near the food of his God."
Leviticus,21,22,"He may eat the food of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy"
Leviticus,21,23,"only he shall not go in to the veil or approach the altar because he has a defect, so that he will not profane My sanctuaries. For I am Yahweh who makes them holy.’ ”"
Leviticus,21,24,So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel.
Leviticus,22,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,22,2,"“Tell Aaron and his sons to be careful with the holy gifts of the sons of Israel, which they set apart to Me as holy, so as not to profane My holy name; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,22,3,"Say to them, ‘If any man among all your seed throughout your generations comes near to the holy gifts which the sons of Israel set apart as holy to Yahweh, and he has an uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from before Me; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,22,4,"No man of the seed of Aaron, who is a leper or who has a discharge, may eat of the holy gifts until he is clean. And if one touches anything made unclean by a corpse, or if a man has a seminal emission"
Leviticus,22,5,"or if a man touches any teeming things by which he is made unclean or any man by whom he is made unclean, whatever his uncleanness"
Leviticus,22,6,a person who touches any such thing shall be unclean until evening and shall not eat of the holy gifts unless he has bathed his body in water.
Leviticus,22,7,"But the sun will set, and he will be clean. And afterward he shall eat of the holy gifts, for it is his food."
Leviticus,22,8,"He shall not eat an animal which dies or is torn by beasts, becoming unclean by it; I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,22,9,They shall therefore keep My charge so that they will not bear sin because of it and die thereby because they profane it; I am Yahweh who makes them holy.
Leviticus,22,10,"‘No layman, however, is to eat the holy gift; a foreign resident with the priest or a hired man shall not eat of the holy gift."
Leviticus,22,11,"But if a priest buys a person as his property with his money, that one may eat of it, and those who are born in his house may eat of his food."
Leviticus,22,12,"If a priest’s daughter is married to a layman, she shall not eat of the contribution of the holy gifts."
Leviticus,22,13,"But if a priest’s daughter becomes a widow or divorced, and has no seed, and returns to her father’s house as in her youth, she shall eat of her father’s food; but no layman shall eat of it."
Leviticus,22,14,"But if a man eats a holy gift unintentionally, then he shall add to it a fifth of it and shall give the holy gift to the priest."
Leviticus,22,15,They shall not profane the holy gifts of the sons of Israel which they raise up to Yahweh
Leviticus,22,16,and so cause them to bear punishment for guilt by eating their holy gifts; for I am Yahweh who makes them holy.’ ”
Leviticus,22,17,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,22,18,"“Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘Any man of the house of Israel or of the sojourners in Israel who brings near his offering, whether it is any of their votive or any of their freewill offerings, which they bring near to Yahweh for a burnt offering"
Leviticus,22,19,"for you to be accepted—it must be a male without blemish from the cattle, the sheep, or the goats."
Leviticus,22,20,"Whatever has a defect, you shall not bring it near, for it will not be accepted for you."
Leviticus,22,21,"And when a man brings a sacrifice of peace offerings near to Yahweh to fulfill a special vow or for a freewill offering, of the herd or of the flock, it must be without blemish to be accepted; there shall be no defect in it."
Leviticus,22,22,"Those that are blind or fractured or maimed or have a running sore or eczema or scabs, you shall not bring near to Yahweh nor make of them an offering by fire on the altar to Yahweh."
Leviticus,22,23,"Now in respect to an ox or a lamb which has an overgrown or stunted member, you may offer it for a freewill offering, but for a votive offering it will not be accepted."
Leviticus,22,24,"Also anything with its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut, you shall not bring near to Yahweh, and you shall not do thus in your land"
Leviticus,22,25,"nor shall you bring near any such thing from the hand of a foreigner for offering as the food of your God; for their corruption is in them, they have a defect; they shall not be accepted for you.’ ”"
Leviticus,22,26,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,22,27,"“When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother, and from the eighth day on it shall be accepted as a sacrifice of an offering by fire to Yahweh."
Leviticus,22,28,"But, whether it is an ox or a sheep, you shall not slaughter both it and its young in one day."
Leviticus,22,29,"And when you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Yahweh, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted."
Leviticus,22,30,It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall leave none of it until morning; I am Yahweh.
Leviticus,22,31,So you shall keep My commandments and do them; I am Yahweh.
Leviticus,22,32,"“And you shall not profane My holy name, but I will be treated as holy among the sons of Israel; I am Yahweh who makes you holy"
Leviticus,22,33,who brought you out from the land of Egypt to be your God; I am Yahweh.”
Leviticus,23,1,"And Yahweh spoke again to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,23,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘The appointed times of Yahweh which you shall proclaim as holy convocations—My appointed times are these"
Leviticus,23,3,"‘For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a sabbath of complete rest, a holy convocation. You shall not do any work; it is a sabbath to Yahweh in all your places of habitation."
Leviticus,23,4,"‘These are the appointed times of Yahweh, holy convocations which you shall proclaim at the times appointed for them."
Leviticus,23,5,"In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight is the Passover of Yahweh."
Leviticus,23,6,Then on the fifteenth day of the same month there is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to Yahweh; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.
Leviticus,23,7,On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work.
Leviticus,23,8,But for seven days you shall bring near an offering by fire to Yahweh. On the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work.’ ”
Leviticus,23,9,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,23,10,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you enter the land which I am going to give to you and reap its harvest, then you shall bring in the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest."
Leviticus,23,11,And he shall wave the sheaf before Yahweh for you to be accepted; on the day after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
Leviticus,23,12,"Now on the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb one year old without blemish for a burnt offering to Yahweh."
Leviticus,23,13,"Its grain offering shall then be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering by fire to Yahweh for a soothing aroma, with its drink offering, a fourth of a hin of wine."
Leviticus,23,14,"Until this same day, until you have brought in the offering of your God, you shall eat neither bread nor roasted grain nor new growth. It is to be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your places of habitation."
Leviticus,23,15,"‘You shall also count for yourselves from the day after the sabbath, from the day when you brought in the sheaf of the wave offering; there shall be seven complete sabbaths."
Leviticus,23,16,You shall count fifty days to the day after the seventh sabbath; then you shall bring a new grain offering near to Yahweh.
Leviticus,23,17,"You shall bring in from your places of habitation two loaves of bread for a wave offering, made of two-tenths of an ephah; they shall be of a fine flour, baked with leaven as first fruits to Yahweh."
Leviticus,23,18,"Along with the bread you shall bring near seven one year old male lambs without blemish and a bull from the herd and two rams; they shall be a burnt offering to Yahweh, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to Yahweh."
Leviticus,23,19,You shall also offer one male goat for a sin offering and two male lambs one year old for a sacrifice of peace offerings.
Leviticus,23,20,The priest shall then wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering with two lambs before Yahweh; they shall be holy to Yahweh for the priest.
Leviticus,23,21,On this same day you shall make a proclamation as well; it shall be a holy convocation for you. You shall do no laborious work. It is to be a perpetual statute in all your places of habitation throughout your generations.
Leviticus,23,22,"‘When you reap the harvest of your land, moreover, you shall not reap to the very corners of your field nor gather the gleaning of your harvest; you are to leave them for the afflicted and the sojourner. I am Yahweh your God.’ ”"
Leviticus,23,23,"Again Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,23,24,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘In the seventh month on the first of the month you shall have a rest, a memorial by blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation."
Leviticus,23,25,"You shall not do any laborious work, but you shall bring an offering by fire near to Yahweh.’ ”"
Leviticus,23,26,"And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,23,27,"“On exactly the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; it shall be a holy convocation for you, and you shall humble your souls and bring an offering by fire near to Yahweh."
Leviticus,23,28,"And you shall not do any work on this same day, for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement on your behalf before Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,23,29,"If there is any person who will not humble himself on this same day, he shall be cut off from his people."
Leviticus,23,30,"And as for any person who does any work on this same day, that person I will cause to perish from among his people."
Leviticus,23,31,You shall do no work at all. It is to be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your places of habitation.
Leviticus,23,32,"It is to be a sabbath of complete rest to you, and you shall humble your souls; on the ninth of the month at evening, from evening until evening you shall keep your sabbath.”"
Leviticus,23,33,"Again Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,23,34,"“Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘On the fifteenth of this seventh month is the Feast of Booths for seven days to Yahweh."
Leviticus,23,35,On the first day is a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work of any kind.
Leviticus,23,36,For seven days you shall bring an offering by fire near to Yahweh. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation and bring an offering by fire near to Yahweh; it is a solemn assembly. You shall do no laborious work.
Leviticus,23,37,"‘These are the appointed times of Yahweh which you shall proclaim as holy convocations, to bring offerings by fire near to Yahweh—burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each day’s matter on its own day"
Leviticus,23,38,"besides those of the sabbaths of Yahweh and besides your gifts and besides all your votive and freewill offerings, which you give to Yahweh."
Leviticus,23,39,"‘On exactly the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the produce of the land, you shall celebrate the feast of Yahweh for seven days, with a rest on the first day and a rest on the eighth day."
Leviticus,23,40,"And on the first day you shall take for yourselves the foliage of beautiful trees, palm branches and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook, and you shall be glad before Yahweh your God for seven days."
Leviticus,23,41,You shall thus celebrate it as a feast to Yahweh for seven days in the year. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
Leviticus,23,42,You shall live in booths for seven days; all the native-born in Israel shall live in booths
Leviticus,23,43,so that your generations may know that I had the sons of Israel live in booths when I brought them out from the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.’ ”
Leviticus,23,44,So Moses spoke to the sons of Israel the appointed times of Yahweh.
Leviticus,24,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,24,2,"“Command the sons of Israel that they bring to you clear oil from beaten olives for the light, to make a lamp burn continually."
Leviticus,24,3,"Outside the veil of testimony in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall keep it in order from evening to morning before Yahweh continually; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations."
Leviticus,24,4,He shall keep the lamps in order on the pure gold lampstand before Yahweh continually.
Leviticus,24,5,“Then you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it; two-tenths of an ephah shall be in each cake.
Leviticus,24,6,"And you shall set them in two rows, six to a row, on the pure gold table before Yahweh."
Leviticus,24,7,"And you shall put pure frankincense on each row that it may be a memorial portion for the bread, even an offering by fire to Yahweh."
Leviticus,24,8,Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before Yahweh continually; it is an everlasting covenant for the sons of Israel.
Leviticus,24,9,"And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy to him from the offerings to Yahweh by fire, his portion forever.”"
Leviticus,24,10,"Now the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the sons of Israel; and the Israelite woman’s son and a man of Israel struggled with each other in the camp."
Leviticus,24,11,"And the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed. So they brought him to Moses. (Now his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)"
Leviticus,24,12,And they put him in custody so that the command of Yahweh might be made clear to them.
Leviticus,24,13,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,24,14,"“Bring the one who has cursed outside the camp, and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head; then let all the congregation stone him."
Leviticus,24,15,"And you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘If anyone curses his God, then he will bear his sin."
Leviticus,24,16,"Moreover, the one who blasphemes the name of Yahweh shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death."
Leviticus,24,17,"‘If a man strikes down the life of any human being, he shall surely be put to death."
Leviticus,24,18,"And the one who strikes down the life of an animal shall make restitution for it, life for life."
Leviticus,24,19,"If a man injures his neighbor, just as he has done, so it shall be done to him"
Leviticus,24,20,"fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; just as he has injured a man, so it shall be inflicted on him."
Leviticus,24,21,"Thus the one who strikes down an animal shall make restitution for it, but the one who strikes down a man shall be put to death."
Leviticus,24,22,"There shall be one standard of judgment for you; it shall be for the sojourner as well as the native, for I am Yahweh your God.’ ”"
Leviticus,24,23,"Then Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and they brought the one who had cursed outside the camp and stoned him with stones. Thus the sons of Israel did, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses."
Leviticus,25,1,"Yahweh then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, saying"
Leviticus,25,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you come into the land which I am giving to you, then the land shall have a sabbath to Yahweh."
Leviticus,25,3,"Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its produce"
Leviticus,25,4,"but during the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest, a sabbath to Yahweh; you shall not sow your field nor prune your vineyard."
Leviticus,25,5,"What grows of its own accord from your harvest you shall not reap, and your grapes of untrimmed vines you shall not gather; the land shall have a sabbatical year."
Leviticus,25,6,"And the sabbath produce of the land shall be for food; for you and your male and female slaves and your hired man and your foreign resident, those who sojourn with you."
Leviticus,25,7,Even your cattle and the beasts that are in your land shall have all its produce to eat.
Leviticus,25,8,"‘You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven sabbaths of years, namely, forty-nine years."
Leviticus,25,9,You shall then sound a ram’s horn abroad on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall sound a horn all through your land.
Leviticus,25,10,"You shall thus set apart as holy the fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, and each of you shall return to his own possession of land, and each of you shall return to his family."
Leviticus,25,11,You shall have the fiftieth year as a jubilee; you shall not sow; you shall not reap what grows of its own accord; you shall not gather in from its untrimmed vines.
Leviticus,25,12,For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat its produce out of the field.
Leviticus,25,13,"‘On this year of jubilee, each of you shall return to his own possession of land."
Leviticus,25,14,"If you make a sale, moreover, to your companion or buy from your friend’s hand, you shall not mistreat one another."
Leviticus,25,15,"Corresponding to the number of years after the jubilee, you shall buy from your companion; he is to sell to you according to the number of years of produce."
Leviticus,25,16,"In proportion to the extent of the years you shall increase its price, and in proportion to the fewness of the years you shall diminish its price, for it is the number of crops it produces that he is selling to you."
Leviticus,25,17,"So you shall not mistreat one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,25,18,"‘You shall thus observe My statutes and keep My judgments, so as to do them, that you may live securely on the land."
Leviticus,25,19,"Then the land will yield its fruit, so that you can eat your fill and live securely on it."
Leviticus,25,20,"But if you say, “What are we going to eat on the seventh year if we do not sow or gather in our produce?”"
Leviticus,25,21,then I will command My blessing for you in the sixth year that it will bring forth the produce for three years.
Leviticus,25,22,"So you shall sow the eighth year and eat old things from that produce, eating the old until the ninth year when its produce comes in."
Leviticus,25,23,"‘The land, moreover, shall not be sold permanently, for the land is Mine; for you are but sojourners and foreign residents with Me."
Leviticus,25,24,"Thus for every piece of land of your possession, you shall provide for the redemption of the land."
Leviticus,25,25,"‘If a brother of yours becomes so poor he has to sell part of his possession of land, then his nearest kinsman redeemer is to come and redeem what his brother has sold."
Leviticus,25,26,"Or in case a man has no kinsman redeemer, but recovers his means and finds sufficient payment for its redemption"
Leviticus,25,27,"then he shall calculate the years since its sale and return the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and so return to his possession of land."
Leviticus,25,28,"But if he has not found sufficient means to return it to himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee; but at the jubilee it shall revert, that he may return to his possession of land."
Leviticus,25,29,"‘Likewise, if a man sells a house for habitation in a walled city, then his redemption right remains valid until a full year from its sale; his right of redemption lasts a full year."
Leviticus,25,30,"But if it is not redeemed for him within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city passes permanently to its purchaser throughout his generations; it does not revert in the jubilee."
Leviticus,25,31,"The houses of the villages, however, which have no surrounding wall, shall be considered as open fields; they have redemption rights and revert in the jubilee."
Leviticus,25,32,"As for cities of the Levites, the Levites have a permanent right of redemption for the houses of the cities which are their possession."
Leviticus,25,33,"What, therefore, belongs to the Levites may be redeemed, and a house sale in the city of their possession reverts in the jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel."
Leviticus,25,34,"But pasture fields of their cities shall not be sold, for that is their perpetual possession."
Leviticus,25,35,"‘Now if a brother of yours becomes poor and his means with regard to you falter, then you are to sustain him, like a sojourner or a foreign resident, that he may live with you."
Leviticus,25,36,"Do not take usurious interest from him, but fear your God, that your brother may live with you."
Leviticus,25,37,You shall not give him your silver at interest nor your food for gain.
Leviticus,25,38,"I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God."
Leviticus,25,39,"‘If a brother of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he sells himself to you, you shall not subject him to a slave’s service."
Leviticus,25,40,"He shall be with you as a hired man, as if he were a foreign resident; he shall serve with you until the year of jubilee."
Leviticus,25,41,"He shall then go out from you, he and his sons with him, and shall return to his family, that he may return to the possession of the land of his fathers."
Leviticus,25,42,For they are My slaves whom I brought out from the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold in a slave sale.
Leviticus,25,43,"You shall not have dominion over him with brutality, but you shall fear your God."
Leviticus,25,44,As for your male and female slaves whom you may have—you may acquire male and female slaves from the nations that are around you.
Leviticus,25,45,"And also you may acquire from the sons of the foreign residents who sojourn among you, from them and their families who are with you; as for those whom they have begotten in your land, they also may become your possession."
Leviticus,25,46,"You may even give them as an inheritance to your sons after you, to receive as a possession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your brothers, the sons of Israel, you shall not have dominion over one another with brutality."
Leviticus,25,47,"‘Now if the means of a sojourner or of a foreign resident with you becomes sufficient, and a brother of yours becomes so poor with regard to him as to sell himself to a sojourner who resides with you or to the descendants of a sojourner’s family"
Leviticus,25,48,then he shall have redemption right after he has been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him
Leviticus,25,49,"or his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his family may redeem him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself."
Leviticus,25,50,He then with his purchaser shall calculate from the year when he sold himself to him up to the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall correspond to the number of years. It is like the days of a hired man that he shall be with him.
Leviticus,25,51,"If there are still many years, he shall return part of his purchase price in proportion to them for his own redemption"
Leviticus,25,52,"and if few years remain until the year of jubilee, he shall so calculate with him. In proportion to his years he shall return the amount for his redemption."
Leviticus,25,53,Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him; he shall not have dominion over him with brutality in your sight.
Leviticus,25,54,"Even if he is not redeemed by these means, he shall still go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with him."
Leviticus,25,55,For the sons of Israel are My slaves; they are My slaves whom I brought out from the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.
Leviticus,26,1,"‘You shall not make for yourselves idols, nor shall you set up for yourselves a graven image or a sacred pillar, nor shall you place a carved stone in your land to bow down to it; for I am Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,26,2,You shall keep My sabbaths and fear My sanctuary; I am Yahweh.
Leviticus,26,3,If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments so as to do them
Leviticus,26,4,"then I shall give you rains in their season, so that the land will give forth its produce and the trees of the field will give forth their fruit."
Leviticus,26,5,"Indeed, your threshing will last for you until grape gathering, and grape gathering will last until sowing time. You will thus eat your food to the full and live securely in your land."
Leviticus,26,6,"I shall also give you peace in the land so that you may lie down, with no one making you tremble. I shall also eliminate wild beasts from the land, and no sword will pass through your land."
Leviticus,26,7,"But you will pursue your enemies, and they will fall before you by the sword"
Leviticus,26,8,"and five of you will pursue one hundred, and one hundred of you will pursue ten thousand, and your enemies will fall before you by the sword."
Leviticus,26,9,"So I will turn toward you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will confirm My covenant with you."
Leviticus,26,10,And you will eat the old supply and clear out the old because of the new.
Leviticus,26,11,"Moreover, I will make My dwelling among you, and My soul will not loathe you."
Leviticus,26,12,"I will also walk among you and be your God, and you shall be My people."
Leviticus,26,13,"I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt so that you would not be their slaves, and I broke the bars of your yoke and made you walk erect."
Leviticus,26,14,‘But if you do not obey Me and do not do all these commandments
Leviticus,26,15,"if, instead, you reject My statutes, and if your soul loathes My judgments so as not to do all My commandments and so break My covenant"
Leviticus,26,16,"I, in turn, will do this to you: I will appoint over you a sudden terror, consumption and fever that will waste away the eyes and cause the soul to pine away; also, you will sow your seed uselessly, for your enemies will eat it up."
Leviticus,26,17,"And I will set My face against you so that you will be defeated before your enemies; and those who hate you will have dominion over you, and you will flee when no one is pursuing you."
Leviticus,26,18,"If also after these things you do not obey Me, then I will discipline you seven times more for your sins."
Leviticus,26,19,I will also break down your pride of strength; I will also give your sky over to become like iron and your earth like bronze.
Leviticus,26,20,"And your power will be spent uselessly, for your land will not give forth its produce and the trees of the land will not give forth their fruit."
Leviticus,26,21,"‘If then, you walk in hostility against Me and are unwilling to obey Me, I will increase the plague on you seven times according to your sins."
Leviticus,26,22,"And I will send out among you the beasts of the field, which will bereave you of your children and cut down your cattle and reduce your number so that your roads lie desolate."
Leviticus,26,23,"‘And if by these things you do not accept My discipline, but walk in hostility against Me"
Leviticus,26,24,"then I will walk in hostility against you; and I, even I, will strike you seven times for your sins."
Leviticus,26,25,"I will also bring upon you a sword which will execute vengeance for the covenant; and when you gather together into your cities, I will send pestilence among you so that you shall be given over into enemy hands."
Leviticus,26,26,"When I break your staff of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven, and they will bring back your bread by rationed weight so that you will eat and not become full."
Leviticus,26,27,"‘Yet, if in spite of this you do not obey Me, but walk in hostility against Me"
Leviticus,26,28,"then I will walk in wrathful hostility against you, and I, even I, will discipline you seven times for your sins."
Leviticus,26,29,"Further, you will eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters you will eat."
Leviticus,26,30,"I then will destroy your high places and cut down your incense altars and give your corpses to lie on the corpses of your idols, for My soul shall loathe you."
Leviticus,26,31,"And I will give your cities over as a waste and will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell your soothing aromas."
Leviticus,26,32,"And I will make the land desolate, so that your enemies who inhabit it will themselves feel desolate because of it."
Leviticus,26,33,"You, however, I will scatter among the nations and will draw out a sword after you, as your land becomes desolate and your cities become waste."
Leviticus,26,34,"‘Then the land will make up for its sabbaths all the days of the desolation, and you will be in your enemies’ land; then the land will rest and make up for its sabbaths."
Leviticus,26,35,"All the days of its desolation it will observe the rest which it did not observe on your sabbaths, while you were living on it."
Leviticus,26,36,"As for those of you who may remain, I will also bring weakness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. And the sound of a driven leaf will pursue them, and even when no one is pursuing they will flee as though from the sword, and they will fall."
Leviticus,26,37,"They will therefore stumble over each other as if running from the sword, although no one is pursuing; and you will have no strength to stand up before your enemies."
Leviticus,26,38,"But you will perish among the nations, and your enemies’ land will consume you."
Leviticus,26,39,So those of you who may remain will rot away in their iniquity in the lands of your enemies; and also in the iniquities of their fathers they will rot away with them.
Leviticus,26,40,"‘If they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, in their unfaithfulness which they committed against Me, and also how they walked in hostility against Me"
Leviticus,26,41,"I also was walking in hostility against them, to bring them into the land of their enemies—or if their uncircumcised heart becomes humbled so that they then make up for their iniquity"
Leviticus,26,42,"then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and I will remember also My covenant with Isaac and My covenant with Abraham as well, and I will remember the land."
Leviticus,26,43,"For the land will be forsaken by them and will make up for its sabbaths while it is made desolate without them. They, meanwhile, will be making up for their iniquity because they rejected My judgments and their soul loathed My statutes."
Leviticus,26,44,"Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, nor will I so loathe them as to bring an end to them, breaking My covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God."
Leviticus,26,45,"But I will remember for them the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am Yahweh.’ ”"
Leviticus,26,46,These are the statutes and judgments and laws which Yahweh has given to be between Himself and the sons of Israel by the hand of Moses at Mount Sinai.
Leviticus,27,1,"Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying"
Leviticus,27,2,"“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When a man makes a difficult vow, he shall be valued according to your valuation of persons belonging to Yahweh."
Leviticus,27,3,"If your valuation is of the male from twenty years even to sixty years old, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary."
Leviticus,27,4,"Or if it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels."
Leviticus,27,5,If it be from five years even to twenty years old then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels.
Leviticus,27,6,"But if they are from a month even up to five years old, then your valuation shall be five shekels of silver for the male, and for the female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver."
Leviticus,27,7,"If they are from sixty years old and upward, if it is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels."
Leviticus,27,8,"But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be presented before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the means of the one who vowed, the priest shall value him."
Leviticus,27,9,"‘Now if it is an animal of the kind which men can bring near as an offering to Yahweh, any such that one gives to Yahweh shall be holy."
Leviticus,27,10,"He shall not replace it or exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; or if he does exchange animal for animal, then both it and its substitute shall become holy."
Leviticus,27,11,"If, however, it is any unclean animal of the kind which men do not bring near as an offering to Yahweh, then he shall present the animal before the priest."
Leviticus,27,12,"And the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as you, the priest, value it, so it shall be."
Leviticus,27,13,"But if he should ever wish to redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth of it to your valuation."
Leviticus,27,14,"‘Now if a man sets his house apart as holy to Yahweh, then the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall stand."
Leviticus,27,15,"Yet if the one who sets it apart as holy should wish to redeem his house, then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it, so that it may be his."
Leviticus,27,16,"‘Again, if a man sets apart as holy to Yahweh a portion of the fields of his own possession, then your valuation shall be proportionate to the seed needed for it: a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver."
Leviticus,27,17,"If he sets apart his field as holy from the year of jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand."
Leviticus,27,18,"If he sets apart his field as holy after the jubilee, however, then the priest shall calculate the price for him proportionate to the years that are left until the year of jubilee; and it shall be deducted from your valuation."
Leviticus,27,19,"If the one who sets it apart as holy should ever wish to redeem the field, then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it so that it may stand as his own."
Leviticus,27,20,"Yet if he will not redeem the field, but has sold the field to another man, it may no longer be redeemed"
Leviticus,27,21,"and it will be that when it reverts in the jubilee, the field shall be holy to Yahweh, like a field that is devoted; it shall be for the priest as his possession."
Leviticus,27,22,"Or if he sets apart as holy to Yahweh a field which he has bought, which is not a portion of the field of his own possession"
Leviticus,27,23,then the priest shall calculate for him the amount of your valuation up to the year of jubilee; and he shall on that day give your valuation as holy to Yahweh.
Leviticus,27,24,"In the year of jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom he bought it, to whom the possession of the land belongs."
Leviticus,27,25,"Every valuation of yours, moreover, shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary. The shekel shall be twenty gerahs."
Leviticus,27,26,"‘However, a firstborn among animals, which as a firstborn belongs to Yahweh, no man may set it apart as holy; whether ox or sheep, it is Yahweh’s."
Leviticus,27,27,"But if it is among the unclean animals, then he shall ransom it according to your valuation and add to it one-fifth of it; and if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation."
Leviticus,27,28,"‘Nevertheless, anything which a man devotes to Yahweh out of all that he has, of man or animal or of the fields of his own possession, shall not be sold or redeemed. Anything devoted to destruction is most holy to Yahweh."
Leviticus,27,29,No one who may have been devoted among men shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus,27,30,"‘Thus all the tithe of the land, of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, belongs to Yahweh; it is holy to Yahweh."
Leviticus,27,31,"If, therefore, a man wishes to redeem part of his tithe, he shall add to it one-fifth of it."
Leviticus,27,32,"For every tenth part of herd or flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth one shall be holy to Yahweh."
Leviticus,27,33,"He shall not inquire whether it is good or bad, nor shall he exchange it; or if he does exchange it, then both it and its substitute shall become holy. It shall not be redeemed.’ ”"
Leviticus,27,34,These are the commandments which Yahweh commanded Moses for the sons of Israel at Mount Sinai.
