Ruth,1,1,"Now it happened in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the fields of Moab with his wife and his two sons."
Ruth,1,2,"The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife, Naomi; and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem in Judah. Now they came to the fields of Moab and remained there."
Ruth,1,3,"Then Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left with her two sons."
Ruth,1,4,They took for themselves Moabite women as wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. And they lived there about ten years.
Ruth,1,5,"Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and the woman was left without her two children and her husband."
Ruth,1,6,"Then she arose with her daughters-in-law and returned from the fields of Moab, for she had heard in the fields of Moab that Yahweh had visited His people to give them food."
Ruth,1,7,"So she went forth from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah."
Ruth,1,8,"And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, return each of you to her mother’s house. May Yahweh show lovingkindness with you as you have shown with the dead and with me."
Ruth,1,9,"May Yahweh grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband.” Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept."
Ruth,1,10,"And they said to her, “No, but we will return with you to your people.”"
Ruth,1,11,"But Naomi said, “Return, my daughters. Why should you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?"
Ruth,1,12,"Return, my daughters! Go, for I am too old to have a husband. If I said I have hope, if I should even have a husband tonight and also bear sons"
Ruth,1,13,"would you therefore wait until they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters; for it is more bitter for me than for you, for the hand of Yahweh has gone forth against me.”"
Ruth,1,14,"And they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her."
Ruth,1,15,"Then she said, “Behold, your sister-in-law has returned to her people and her gods; return after your sister-in-law.”"
Ruth,1,16,"But Ruth said, “Do not press me to forsake you in turning back from following you; for where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God, my God."
Ruth,1,17,"Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. Thus may Yahweh do to me, and more, if anything but death separates you and me.”"
Ruth,1,18,"So she saw that she was determined to go with her, and she said no more to her."
Ruth,1,19,"Then they both went until they came to Bethlehem. Now it happened, when they had come to Bethlehem, all the city was stirred because of them, and the women said, “Is this Naomi?”"
Ruth,1,20,"She said to them, “Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me."
Ruth,1,21,"I went out full, but Yahweh has caused me to return empty. Why do you call me Naomi? Yahweh has answered against me, and the Almighty has brought calamity against me.”"
Ruth,1,22,"So Naomi returned, and with her Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, who returned from the fields of Moab. Now they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest."
Ruth,2,1,"Now Naomi had a kinsman of her husband, a mighty man of excellence, of the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz."
Ruth,2,2,"And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after one whom I may find favor in his eyes.” And she said to her, “Go, my daughter.”"
Ruth,2,3,"So she went. And she came and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And it so happened that she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech."
Ruth,2,4,"Now behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, “May Yahweh be with you.” And they said to him, “May Yahweh bless you.”"
Ruth,2,5,"Then Boaz said to his young man who was in charge of the reapers, “Whose young woman is this?”"
Ruth,2,6,"The young man in charge of the reapers replied, “She is the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the fields of Moab."
Ruth,2,7,"And she said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ Thus she came and has remained from the morning until now; she has been sitting in the house for a little while.”"
Ruth,2,8,"Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Have you not heard, my daughter? Do not go to glean in another field; furthermore, do not go on from this one, but stay here with my young women."
Ruth,2,9,"Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them. Indeed, I have commanded the young men not to touch you. And if you are thirsty, go to the water jars and drink from what the young men draw.”"
Ruth,2,10,"Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your sight that you should take notice of me, though I am a foreigner?”"
Ruth,2,11,"Boaz replied to her, “All that you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband has been fully told to me, and how you forsook your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and came to a people that you did not previously know."
Ruth,2,12,"May Yahweh fully repay your work, and may your wages be full from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to seek refuge.”"
Ruth,2,13,"Then she said, “May I find favor in your eyes, my lord, for you have comforted me and indeed have spoken to the heart of your servant-woman, though I am not like one of your servant-women.”"
Ruth,2,14,"At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come here, that you may eat of the bread and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers; and he served her roasted grain, and she ate and was satisfied and had some left."
Ruth,2,15,"Then she rose to glean, and Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not dishonor her."
Ruth,2,16,"Also you shall purposely pull out for her some grain from the bundles and leave it that she may glean, and do not rebuke her.”"
Ruth,2,17,"So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley."
Ruth,2,18,"She took it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. She also took it out and gave Naomi what she had left after she was satisfied."
Ruth,2,19,"Her mother-in-law then said to her, “Where did you glean today and where did you work? May he who took notice of you be blessed.” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said, “The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.”"
Ruth,2,20,"Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed of Yahweh who has not forsaken his lovingkindness to the living and to the dead.” Then Naomi said to her, “The man is our relative; he is one of our kinsman redeemers.”"
Ruth,2,21,"Then Ruth the Moabitess said, “Furthermore, he said to me, ‘You should stay close to my young men until they have finished all my harvest.’ ”"
Ruth,2,22,"Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, so that others do not oppress you in another field.”"
Ruth,2,23,So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz in order to glean until the end of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
Ruth,3,1,"Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, shall I not seek a state of rest for you, that it may be well with you?"
Ruth,3,2,"And now, is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose young women you were? Behold, he is winnowing barley at the threshing floor tonight."
Ruth,3,3,"So you shall wash yourself and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes, and you shall go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking."
Ruth,3,4,"Let it be that when he lies down, you shall know the place where he lies, and you shall go and uncover his feet and lie down; then he will tell you what you shall do.”"
Ruth,3,5,"She said to her, “All that you say I will do.”"
Ruth,3,6,So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her.
Ruth,3,7,"And Boaz ate and drank and his heart was merry, and he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came secretly and uncovered his feet and lay down."
Ruth,3,8,"Then it happened in the middle of the night that the man was startled and bent forward; and behold, a woman was lying at his feet."
Ruth,3,9,"And he said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth your maidservant. So spread your wing over your maidservant, for you are a kinsman redeemer.”"
Ruth,3,10,"Then he said, “May you be blessed of Yahweh, my daughter. You have shown your last lovingkindness to be better than the first by not going after young men, whether poor or rich."
Ruth,3,11,"So now, my daughter, do not fear. All that you say, I will do for you; for all my people within the gates of the city know that you are a woman of excellence."
Ruth,3,12,"But now it is true I am a kinsman redeemer; however, there is a kinsman redeemer closer than I."
Ruth,3,13,"Stay this night, and it will be in the morning that, if he will redeem you, good; let him redeem you. But if he does not desire to redeem you, then I will redeem you, as Yahweh lives. Lie down until morning.”"
Ruth,3,14,"So she lay at his feet until morning and rose before one could recognize another; and he said, “Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.”"
Ruth,3,15,"And he said, “Give me the cloak that is on you and hold it.” So she held it, and he measured six measures of barley and placed it on her. Then she went into the city."
Ruth,3,16,"Then she came to her mother-in-law, and she said, “How did it go, my daughter?” And she told her all that the man had done for her."
Ruth,3,17,"She said, “These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said, ‘Do not go to your mother-in-law empty.’ ”"
Ruth,3,18,"Then she said, “Sit, then, my daughter, until you know how the matter falls into place; for the man will not remain quiet until he has finished the matter today.”"
Ruth,4,1,"Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there, and behold, the kinsman redeemer of whom Boaz spoke was passing by, so he said, “Turn aside, my fellow, sit down here.” And he turned aside and sat down."
Ruth,4,2,"Then he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down."
Ruth,4,3,"Then he said to the kinsman redeemer, “Naomi, who has come back from the fields of Moab, has to sell the portion of the field which belonged to our brother Elimelech."
Ruth,4,4,"So I thought to uncover this matter in your hearing, saying, ‘Acquire it before those who are sitting here and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if no one redeems it, tell me that I may know; for there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am after you.’ ” And he said, “I will redeem it.”"
Ruth,4,5,"Then Boaz said, “On the day you acquire the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the one who had died, in order to raise up the name of the one who had died, on behalf of his inheritance.”"
Ruth,4,6,"So the kinsman redeemer said, “I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I ruin my own inheritance. You redeem my right of redemption for yourself, for I cannot redeem it.”"
Ruth,4,7,Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning the right of redemption and the exchange of land to establish any matter: a man removed his sandal and gave it to another; and this was the manner of attestation in Israel.
Ruth,4,8,"So the kinsman redeemer said to Boaz, “Acquire this for yourself.” And he removed his sandal."
Ruth,4,9,"Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I have acquired all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon from the hand of Naomi."
Ruth,4,10,"And also, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, to be my wife in order to raise up the name of the one who had died, on behalf of his inheritance, so that the name of the one who had died will not be cut off from his brothers or from the gate of his birth place; you are witnesses today.”"
Ruth,4,11,"And all the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, “We are witnesses. May Yahweh grant the woman who is coming into your home to be like Rachel and Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel, and so you shall achieve excellence in Ephrathah and shall proclaim your name in Bethlehem."
Ruth,4,12,"Moreover, may your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah, through the seed which Yahweh will grant you by this young woman.”"
Ruth,4,13,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife, and he went in to her. And Yahweh granted her conception, and she gave birth to a son."
Ruth,4,14,"Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed is Yahweh who has not left you without a kinsman redeemer today, and may his name be proclaimed in Israel."
Ruth,4,15,"May he also be to you a restorer of your soul and a sustainer of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.”"
Ruth,4,16,Then Naomi took the child and put him on her bosom and became his nurse.
Ruth,4,17,"The neighbor women gave him a name, saying, “A son has been born to Naomi!” So they named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David."
Ruth,4,18,"Now these are the generations of Perez:
Perez became the father of Hezron"
Ruth,4,19,"and Hezron became the father of Ram,
and Ram became the father of Amminadab"
Ruth,4,20,"and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon,
and Nahshon became the father of Salmah"
Ruth,4,21,"and Salmon became the father of Boaz,
and Boaz became the father of Obed"
Ruth,4,22,"and Obed became the father of Jesse,
and Jesse became the father of David."
